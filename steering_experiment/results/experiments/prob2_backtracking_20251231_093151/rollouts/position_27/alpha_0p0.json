    "text": " But wait, let me check the last set. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but the problem is, we're only considering page numbers up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, starting from 8, each step is +10. The last number is 488. So, to find how many terms there are, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_n = 488, a_1=8, d=10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. So, let's count how many sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. Now, the question is how many more fours are printed than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484.\n   - Solving for n: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488.\n   - Solving for n: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block which has 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. Starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8*49=392, but wait, 8*50=400, so 488 is 488/8=61, but that's not the right approach. Wait, actually, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48 full tens would be up to 480, and then from 481-488, there's another 8 in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, yes, 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99; 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except the last block. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book ends at 488, 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.

So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, because 488 is the 9th number after 480).

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " But wait, does 488 include 449? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor((n + 10 - d)/10), where d is the digit. Here, n=488, d=4. So, (488 + 10 -4)/10 = 494/10 = 49.4, floor to 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: For each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in tens place, so from 0-488, how many hundreds? 488 / 100 = 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Okay, that checks out. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, so how many? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-488, we have: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 numbers in 480-488. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred, 10 numbers with 8 in tens place, so 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49, correct. Units place: 49, tens place:49, total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks give 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, when I did the units place, I thought of 4,14,...,484 as 49 numbers. But wait, 484 is the 49th because starting from 0, 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, and so on up to 484, which would be the 49th. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the 1st, 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, so 98 eights. Fours: 188, so 188-98=90.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, total fours are 188, and total eights are 98.

Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Similarly, for eights, the tens place up to 488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. Yes, that's 89 numbers. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we only have up to 488. So, how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in the 480-488 range, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. From 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. So that's 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 440 is within 488. For eights, in the tens place, I included up to 488, so that's correct. Let me just make sure about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. And for eights, in the hundreds place, none, correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Additionally, in the 400s, 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds place is only the third digit, so in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, yes, 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. Wait, let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10 are there? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4\u00d710=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which has 9.\n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks and 1 partial block.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let me calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-488, the blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there's one set of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. That's 4 sets \u00d710 = 40 eights. Now, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, 5 sets \u00d710 =50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488. The last number is 488, which is 48\u00d710 +8, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of such numbers is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, the hundreds place is zero.

So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights.

Wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but each of those has an 8 in the tens place. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, the hundreds place can only be 4 for numbers 400-499, but since the book stops at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48+1=49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Wait, when counting units place, I thought from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The last occurrence is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each set. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-489 would normally be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, yes, 9 instead of 10. So total tens place eights: 10\u00d74 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the tens place, when I counted 440-449, that's within the 400-488 range, but I don't think that affects the count. Similarly, in the units place, 484 is the last 4 in the units place. I think my counts are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of 4's:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers.  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 40 eights. But wait, the last block is 380-389, which is within 488, so that's fine.

So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and in 400-488, it also appears 10 times (440-449). So that's 5 times 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total.

Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 49 occurrences, right? Because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9.

So, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Let's do the same for 8's, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1) =488. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last). Wait, let me check: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, but wait, 8 occurs at 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's count: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the first is 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, but 488 is the 49th term? Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, let me confirm: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So 5 x 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, seems high, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Wait, from 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50 fours. That seems correct. Similarly, units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours in the units place because 484 is included. So 49. Then hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, each of the first four sets has 10, and the last set has 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total fours: 188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for fours. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 484, which is 484=4 + 10*(n-1), so n-1= (484-4)/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: same as fours, 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So difference:188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, no: units is 49, tens is 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me go through each digit place again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. **Counting Fours Again:**\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting Eights Again:**\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10, the last set has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for fours, 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th term, so 49 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 total. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours might have been miscounted, but no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. So, 90 seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since pages go up to 488).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but our book stops at 488, so it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many tens digits are 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480 is the first, 488 is the ninth). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens digits with 8: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 in 480-488. So total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me check the units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

    "text": " But wait, does 440-449 count as a full set? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add them step by step: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the numbers from 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. So, how many sets are there? Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149 (10),240-249 (10),340-349 (10),440-449 (10): total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9): total 49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Hmm, wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me calculate how many terms that is. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Wait, let me check: 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

    "text": " But wait, does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 is page 440, and 449 is page 449, both within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, so 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, but since we include both ends, it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be pages 480 to 489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, let's add them up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, yes, that seems right. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each gives 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, each giving 10 eights except the last one, which gives 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 fours. Units place: 49, tens:50, so total 49+50+89=188 fours. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, let's count how many sets. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99 +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Let me think about the tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Therefore, the total number of fours is 188, eights is 98, so 188-98=90.

But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's.

Let me find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list a few: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total in tens place: (4*10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) = 480; n-1=48; n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8 (which is the first), then 18 is the second, and so on up to 488 as the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " Wait, but let me double-check. From 0-488, how many hundreds are there? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred except maybe the last one, we have a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 0-99: 40-49: 10 fours. 100-199:140-149:10 fours. 200-299:240-249:10 fours. 300-399:340-349:10 fours. 400-488:440-449:10 fours. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the first is 8, the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 eights. From 100-199:180-189:10 eights. From 200-299:280-289:10 eights. From 300-399:380-389:10 eights. From 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me check: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all five sets are valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each has 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me make sure: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " But wait, let me check: from 40-49: yes, 10. Then each hundred block adds another 10. So 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only in numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me check: from 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for this block. So total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but let me check again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yes. And for eights, in the tens place, I had 49, but let me check again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only once per number, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that's the total number of 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except the last block. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, correct. And in the tens place, for 4's, it's 50, which comes from 5 sets of 10 (40-49, etc.), each contributing 10. So, 5*10=50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 4 to 484, which is 49 numbers. So, that adds up. For 8's, units place is 49, same as 4's. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). However, the last block (480-488) has only 9 occurrences. Total occurrences = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks we have. 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because when I added up fours, I got 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me double-check the counting for eights. Units place: 49 eights, correct. Tens place: 49 eights, correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 98. So, fours: 188, eights:98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me recount. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place:49. So, total eights:98. So, fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check if I counted correctly for fours in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Tens place:50 fours (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.), correct. Units place:49 fours, correct. So, 89+50+49=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me check the eights in the units place again. The last page is 488, so 488 is included. So, units digits go up to 8 in 488. So, from 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:49. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
