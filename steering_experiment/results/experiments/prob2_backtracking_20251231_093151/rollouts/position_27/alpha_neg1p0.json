    "text": " So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's go through the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. To find how many numbers, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds place for fours is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. And in the tens place for fours, we had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place for fours was 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units=49, tens=49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Similarly, for eights, the tens place was 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. So, the total number of fours is 188, eights is 98, so the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 440-449 include 440 to 449? Yes, that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, we have four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights, and then 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So, that's 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, wait. Let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours -98 eights=90.

    "text": " 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but wait: 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as the units digit? No, because 488 has an 8 in the units place, right? So, yes, 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I was counting the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but let me double-check that. Wait, when I was counting the units place for 4's, I considered 4,14,...,484. How many numbers is that? Let me list them: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Similarly, for the units place of 8's, it's 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 mod 10, so yes, that's 49 terms. So, units place for both 4 and 8 have 49 each. Then, tens place for 4's: 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Tens place for 8's: 5 sets but the last set is only 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place for 8's is 49. Hundreds place for 4's is 89, and for 8's, it's 0. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because the difference seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct. Let me think again: in the hundreds place, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 400-488 includes the 440-449 set, which is 10, so that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\(\\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 fours, so:  \n   \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\).\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\(\\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9:  \n   \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289:10 eights. - 380-389:10 eights. - 480-488:9 eights because it's only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many complete sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 8's, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? 488-480+1=9. So, that's correct. So, total eights are 49. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought, I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: each is 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens. 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: that's 5 sets, but the last set has 9 instead of 10. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Now, I think that's correct, but let me double-check. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, so in each 100, there are 10 fours in the tens place. Since we have 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, but the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the tens digit is 4 only when the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which only has 9 because 488 is the last page. Let me count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 10\u00d74=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: total fours (188) minus total eights (98) equals 188-98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Let me see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. And for hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block gives 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Correct. And in the tens place, 50 fours. Units place, 49 fours. So, 89+50=139, 139+49=188. Correct. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. 188-98=90. So, yes, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - However, in the last hundred (400-488), the range is only up to 488, but the tens digit cycles normally up to 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, except the last hundred (400-488), where the range is only up to 488, giving 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, does 440-449 count as 10 fours? Yes, because each of those 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. Wait, that's 98 eights. Wait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred block, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each has 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, Tens:49, so total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Let me see: 488 is the last page, so yes. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 is 488/10=48.8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49 (since 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers). Wait, let me check: from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, which would give 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds place is only the first digit, so from 400 to 488, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, the count is indeed 89 fours.

Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 in all these. So, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, wait: each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights, so that's 4 blocks \u00d710 =40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems high. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place:89 fours. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: each is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours. Correct. For eights: units place:49, correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, gives 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula. For any digit d in a number with n digits, the count can be calculated by looking at each position. But perhaps I can think of it as:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when counting fours, I had 50 fours, which comes from 5 blocks of 10 numbers each (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for eights:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, gives 9 eights (since 488 is the last page). So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think if I'm missing something. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere? For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 includes 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Similarly, in the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included in the units place for fours. The last four in units place is 484, which is correct. So, 484 is the last one before 488. So, 484 is counted as a four in units place. Then, 485,486,487,488 don't have a four in the units place. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, the last eight in the units place is 488, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90 fours more than eights. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, giving 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 8 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. There are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.), and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since 800-899 exceeds 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, does 440-449 count as 10 fours? Yes, because each number in that range has a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 fours in each of the five blocks, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488, with a common difference of 10. The nth term is given by a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that's the calculation, but let me make sure I didn't overcount. Let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, total fours:188. For eights: units place, 49 eights. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but including 488, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is a three-digit number, so let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.

Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the number of 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For the number of 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 +1 = 89. So that's correct. And for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct because 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place for 4's: 49, which is correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484 /10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for 8's, units place: 49, which is correct.

Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. How many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.

For fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. And in the tens place, each hundred block has 10 fours, so 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers?

So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check that again. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Wait, units place: 4,14,...484. Let me confirm: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then 484 is the 49th occurrence. So 49 fours in units place. Tens place: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 sets (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) would be 4*10=40, and then 440-449 is another 10, making it 50. Wait, but 400-499 would be another set, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So yes, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488.

Let's count how many sets of 10 we have. Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. Starting with fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I'm overcounting? For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct. For eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 90 seems correct.

From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, so n = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, is that correct? Let me think: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's see how many full blocks of 100 we have. Each block (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, which is 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place had 49, tens had 50, hundreds had 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units had 49, tens had 49, hundreds had 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I said 5 sets of 10, which is 50. The sets are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. And for hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. That's correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, and there are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Now, wait, let me make sure. From 1-100: 40-49 is 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149 is another 10. 201-300: 240-249: 10. 301-400: 340-349: 10. 401-488: 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including both ends, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, 18, 28,...,488. So, yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. So, let's count how many sets of 10 there are. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 block. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake in the range. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488: 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place in fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10 numbers, and the last is 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are.

Wait, no, because 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is 488, so the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8 as the first.

From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but only the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would have 10, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49, yes. So total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, I counted from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But 488 is the last page, so 488-400+1=89. That's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place:49. So, 188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, difference is 90. But wait, another way to think about it: maybe I'm overcounting in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.

    "text": " So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term can be found by (n-1)*10 +8 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each full hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-489 would be 10, but we stop at 488, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, adding up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 appears in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I subtract 98 from 188, I get 90. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but let me check again. From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units place is 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Now, let's check if 440-449 is within the limit. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: (4*10) +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I said 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. Correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each with 10 eights, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49 for both fours and eights. So, 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. But let's check: 488-400=88, so 88+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the units place. For fours, from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers is that? The formula is usually floor((n - digit)/10) +1. So, for units digit 4, n=488. So, (488 -4)/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, same calculation: (488-8)/10=48, plus1=49. Correct. So, units place correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Tens place for eights:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate how many terms that is. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " Now, I need to check if 488 affects this. Since 488 is beyond 449, the tens digit in 440-449 is 4, and from 450-488, the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 449. So, total tens place 4's are 5 sets * 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when I added 49 + 50, that's 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours there. Now, the tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-100: 40-49 (10), 101-200:140-149 (10), 201-300:240-249 (10), 301-400:340-349 (10), and 401-488:440-449 (10). Wait, but 401-488 is part of the same hundred block as 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. Now, units place: Every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? Let's compute 484 divided by 10, which is 48.4, so 48 full groups, each contributing a 4, and then the 49th term is 484. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), and 9 times in the last block (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in the units place? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each set is 10 numbers: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page. So, for 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me confirm. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. The tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for eights. From 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the units place, up to 484, which is the last number with 4 in the units place before 488. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times in the units place. Wait, but wait: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many numbers is that? Let me calculate: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens: 49, so total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but wait a minute, that seems high. Let me check my counting again, maybe I made a mistake. Let's go back. Counting fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in tens and hundreds, maybe I double-counted or missed something. Let me try another approach, maybe using a formula or considering each digit place separately more carefully. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a number from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is roughly N/10, but we have to adjust for the exact value. Similarly for tens and hundreds places. Let me try to formalize this. Let's consider each digit position separately.\n\n**Counting Fours:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For numbers 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra if the last partial group includes a 4.\n   - Number of complete groups: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups.\n   - Each group contributes 1 four in the units place, so 48 fours.\n   - Now, check if the last partial group (481-488) includes a 4. The last number is 488, so the last four in the units place is 484. So, that's one more four.\n   - Total units fours: 48 +1 =49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50 fours.\n   - Now, check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, since 449 <488.\n   - So, total tens fours:50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488.\n   - The number of numbers here is 488 -400 +1=89.\n   - So, hundreds fours:89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting Eights:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similarly, the units digit is 8 in 8,18,...,488.\n   - Number of complete groups:488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 groups.\n   - Each group contributes 1 eight, so 48 eights.\n   - Check if the last partial group includes 488. Yes, so one more eight.\n   - Total units eights:48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40.\n   - The last range is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).\n   - So, total tens eights:40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so no eights here.\n   - Hundreds eights:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of fours - number of eights =188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.

For eights, since the book ends at 488, the tens place for 480-488 is 9 numbers, which I accounted for. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place and 49 in units place, total 98. So, 188-98=90.

But wait, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. In the tens place, the 8's occur in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, which is correct. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is in the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in 1-488. To calculate this, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48\u00d710=480, so the next number is 488, which is 488, so that's the 49th occurrence.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each have 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 49+49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each gives 10 fours, and there are 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit in 440-449 would also be 4. So, in the tens place, 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. For eights, in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 times.

So, each set before that is 10 numbers, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Tens place: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is another block, but since the tens digit is 8, and the hundreds digit is 4, so 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so only 9 eights in the tens place here. Wait, so let me correct that. The blocks are 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's different from before. Let me think again. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit can be 8, and the units digits go from 0-9 (or 0-8 in the case of 488). So, for hundreds 0: 80-89:10 eights. Hundreds 1:180-189:10. Hundreds 2:280-289:10. Hundreds 3:380-389:10. Hundreds 4:480-488:9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, tens place had 49, so total 98 eights. Now, number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the fours and eights again to make sure.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488 -400 +1=89. So 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so 0 eights here. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is the last page, so when counting the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So that's correct. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. For example, in the hundreds 4, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place for the hundreds 4. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, which is 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

That's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks with 10 eights each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block with 9 eights (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Now, do I need to check if 488 is beyond 449? Well, yes, but since we're only counting the tens place, 440-449 is the last set where the tens digit is 4, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, no, wait. Let me check: From 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then the 49th occurrence is at 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, etc.), that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then, the last set is 9, so total is 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.

How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included.

For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10.

Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many full hundreds there are before 488. From 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed.

That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. So, that's 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? Let's see. The last term is 488, which is in the units place. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, eights in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last block. So, how many complete blocks are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90, but let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place for eights, I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. The eights in the tens place are in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, eights in tens place:49. Units place:49, so total eights:98. Fours:188. So, difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. That seems correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
