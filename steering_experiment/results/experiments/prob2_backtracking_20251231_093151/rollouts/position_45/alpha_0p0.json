Let me count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place in fours, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens place for eights, maybe I missed something. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: from 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10 numbers, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would be part of that range. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next block, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is a full set of 10, but since we stop at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, let me count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, so 49 in units, 49 in tens, that's 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just cross-verify my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Yes, that adds up. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Let me think: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9.

So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total eights: 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the tens place. For 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That seems right because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, tens place:50, units:49, totaling 188. For the eights, units:49, tens:49, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me check again. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units (49), tens (49). 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then each subsequent hundred). So, 5*10=50. That's correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let's count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480=8, but including both ends, it's 9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9.

So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, each set except the last one has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers (480-488). Let's calculate: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the first four blocks, it's 10 each, and the last block is 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 =40 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each set is 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. That's 4*10=40.

So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers.
