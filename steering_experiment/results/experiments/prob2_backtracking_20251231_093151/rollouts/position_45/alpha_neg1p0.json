Wait, but 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems right. And for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours there. So, 50 in the tens place. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 total fours. For eights, units: 49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred block contributes 10 '4's, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), giving 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred block contributes 10 '8's, except the last block which goes up to 488, giving 9 occurrences. Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no '8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just go through again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, we have 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49.

So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights =90.

Yes, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks we have.

Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the 400-488 range contributes 9 eights in the tens place.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480=8, but including both ends, it's 9). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit again. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. Tens place for fours: numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. That's correct. For hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, correct. For eights: tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 -480 +1=9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place for eights: 49, correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I double-counted any numbers? For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 includes numbers like 444, where both tens and units digits are 4. But when counting each digit place separately, that's okay because we're counting each occurrence, regardless of other digits. So, 444 would contribute to both hundreds, tens, and units place counts. So, that's correct. Similarly, 488 would contribute to units and tens place for eights. So, the counting seems accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place from 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 full blocks (each 10 numbers) and one partial block of 9 numbers. So, 4*10 =40, plus 9 =49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. For each hundred, 80-89 is 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 in tens place. Units place:49, so total 98. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place, but only up to 488. Let me count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9.

So, let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8.

Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 is right.

Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours there. So, yes, 188 fours in total. Eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Let's count how many full sets we have and then the partial set. Each full set (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the number of 4's and 8's to ensure accuracy. **Recounting 4's:**\n- Units place: From 4,14,...,484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units:49.\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89.\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Recounting 8's:**\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each set (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 0-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets are complete (each has 10 numbers), and the last set has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait, let me think again. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389), and 4 (480-488). So, that's 5 sets. Each set from 0-3 has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) =90. Wait, but wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I was counting the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me make sure that's correct. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for units place, 8 appears 49 times. So, total 8's:98. Fours:188. So, difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. Hundreds place for fours is from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Let me confirm how many sets that is. From 0-400, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Correct. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. So, no mistake there. I think my calculations are correct.

So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. For hundreds=1,2,3, the tens digit=8 gives 10 numbers each, so 3*10=30. For hundreds=4, the tens digit=8 gives 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total is 30+9=39. Wait, but earlier I thought 10+10+10+10+9=49, but now I'm getting 39. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Then, hundreds=4: 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's = \u230a484 / 10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = **49**.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   Number of 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = **50**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = **89**.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's = \u230a488 / 10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = **49**.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers.  \n   Number of 8's = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = **0**.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
