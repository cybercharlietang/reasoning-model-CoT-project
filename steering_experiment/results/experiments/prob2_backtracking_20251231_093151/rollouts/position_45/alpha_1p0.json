    "text": " Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, so 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. That also seems right.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me recount the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nAnd the hundreds place for fours is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nFor eights, in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4 full blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for eights: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, correct. Because 488 -400 =88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is included, right? So, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets of tens have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me double-check: units 49, tens 49, so 98. Okay. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, 484 is the 49th term because 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last block (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's see how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yep. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98.

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Wait, but 480-489 would have 480-488, but since our book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 would be from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets \u00d710=40. But wait, in the hundreds place, when we get to 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, earlier I thought units place for fours was 49, but when I calculated it, I considered 4,14,...,484. Let me recount that. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 fours. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but our book stops at 488, so in the units place, the last 4 would be at 484, which is within 480-488. So, in 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 484 is included. So, units place fours: 48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit is 4 from 1 to 488. So, the first occurrence is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of such numbers is floor((488 + 1)/10) where the units digit is 4. Alternatively, it's the number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct, 49 fours in the units place. Similarly, for the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the eights: units place, as I thought earlier, is 49. Tens place: I considered 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 eights (480-488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Units place eights:49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 98 eights. Therefore, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, is there any overlap where a number has both a 4 and an 8? Well, when counting digits, each digit position is counted separately, so even if a number has both, like 48, it's counted once in the units place for 8 and once in the tens place for 4. So, that's okay, because we're counting digits, not numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. For the fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nFor the eights, in the hundreds place, there are none, since the book ends at 488. So, no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nFours:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nEights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers each. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9 =49.

Let me recount the fours and eights to ensure I didn't double-count or miss any.\n\nWait, for the fours in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So 89 fours there. For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So 89+50+49=188. That's correct.\n\nFor the eights: units place, 49, correct. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So 49 eights in tens place. Units place: 49.

Let me count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489.

So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488.

So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. So, how many numbers is that? Let me recalculate. The first 4 is at 4, and the last is at 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nTens place for 4's: numbers like 40-49,140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100:40-49 (10 numbers)\n101-200:140-149 (10)\n201-300:240-249 (10)\n301-400:340-349 (10)\n401-488:440-449 (10)\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers.

That's correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n\nUnits place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for eights, I had 49 eights because the last block was 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

    "text": " Wait, is 488 included? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49. Hmm, let me make sure. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fours: units place, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. From 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For the eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49  \n   - Total: 49 fours\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50 fours\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89  \n   - Total: 89 fours\n\n**Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49  \n   - Total: 49 eights\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights.  \n   - Total: (4 * 10) + 9 = 49 eights\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0 eights\n\n**Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Similarly, for eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, which is five sets but the last one has only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit might have more, but in this case, fours in hundreds place are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? Let me compute 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since we start at 8, which is the first term, so 488 is the 49th term. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the units place, fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484 is the 49th term, so 49 fours.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number (since the book ends at 488). This is 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units:49, Tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.
