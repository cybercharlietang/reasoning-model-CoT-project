    "text": " Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, check if there's a partial set in 480-488. 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 more eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours: 188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours first. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me think again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. But 400-488 inclusive is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. For the tens place in eights, I had 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), which is correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, because the hundreds digit is 4 only once per number, so it's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many full hundreds are there? From 1-400, there are four sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 +9=49 eights. Wait, but let me think: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49+49+0=98. Wait, but let me check again. Units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but wait: 400-488 is 89 numbers, but does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. To find the count, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm not sure if 400 is included. Wait, 400 is page 400, which is within the book, so yes, it's included. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. To find how many, we can take the last number, 488, subtract 8, then divide by 10, then add 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, then +1 gives 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, correct. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check my counting again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Wait, earlier I thought tens place was 50, but now I'm getting 50? Wait, no, in the fours case, the tens place was from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the eights, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because the book ends at 488, so no page numbers start with 8. So, that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90.

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds digit can only be 4 in 400-488, so that's correct. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8? Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89. Wait, that's 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's:89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I said 5 sets of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each 10, so 40. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...484. That's 49 numbers. Units place for 8's: 8,18,...488. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 each in units. Tens: 50 vs 40. Hundreds: 89 vs 0. So, 188 vs 89. Difference is 99. So, I think that's the answer. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 4's in the hundreds place are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 89 eights, so 99 more fours.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that set. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and the first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since it stops at 488). So, the first four sets each contribute 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. So, units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98? But wait, let me recount the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. And 480-488: 9 eights. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights: 49+49=98. So, total number of 4's is 188, and total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. From 0-488, how many blocks? 400-488 is 89 numbers, but in terms of hundreds, it's 400-488, which is part of the 400s. Wait, but earlier I thought there are 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because (488-8)/10=48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are.

Now, since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so it's only up to 488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me recount the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's a big number, 90. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems quite a lot. Let me go through the counts again. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units and tens for fours: 49+50=99. So, 99+89=188. For eights, units and tens: 49 each, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but when considering the hundreds digit, only the numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units place: 4,14,...,484. Let me see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of 4's in units place is 49 because it includes both 4 and 484. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, so 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 count? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so yes. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only goes up to 488. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? 480 is the first, then up to 488. So, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the tens place. When I count 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units:49. Tens: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens:40+10=50. Hundreds: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.

So, tens place:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188.

So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, right? Because 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because 488-8=480, which is 48*10, so 49 terms. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the 4 in 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units:49. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, for the tens digit, in each hundred, there's a 40-49 block, which is 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49:10, 100-199:140-149:10, 200-299:240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, and 400-488:440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Now, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the 8 in 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89:10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189:10 eights. - 280-289:10 eights. - 380-389:10 eights. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9 numbers. So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 0-99:80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10 eights. 200-299:280-289:10 eights. 300-399:380-389:10 eights. 400-488:480-488:9 eights. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488 -480 +1=9).

Let me think again. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block (400-488), which only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.

    "text": " Let me add them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, starting from 8, the numbers are 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be a full set, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. Divided by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full tens, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let's list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. How many terms are there? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let's count: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98 =90.

So, 484 is the 49th number because (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 4 hundreds (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s).

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. From 1-99: tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers.

Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that range, so that's correct. So, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, tens place: 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours.

How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets: 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So 49+50+89=188. For the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 -8 = 480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10*4 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So total 8's:49+49=98. So difference:188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I first thought about the units place for 4's, I considered 484 as the last one, which is correct because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. Similarly, for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So the calculation seems right. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Wait, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-488, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, tens place: 10 per hundred, so 4 sets of 100 (1-400) would be 40, but actually, in 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, we have 49 fours in the units place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, but 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total: 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. The hundreds place is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many numbers? Let's see, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in 1-488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 488, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, I subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place of 4, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place for 4: 49, which is correct because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 occurrences. For 8's: units place is 49, same as 4's. Tens place: 49, which includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400 +1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I counted the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me check that: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last block.\n\nSo, the total number of 8's is indeed 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nThus, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one, which has 9 because we only go up to 488. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) would each have 10, and the last partial hundred (401-488) would have 9 in the tens place. So, 4*10 +9=49, which matches.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block contributing 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each block contributing 10 occurrences. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10, and the last block (480-488) has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89= 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place:0 eights. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is floor((484 -4)/10) +1. So, (484-4)=480; 480/10=48; 48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in units place is 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. From 1-400, we have 4 sets (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct. Let me just check again. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place has 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Each block before 400 has 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), which is 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.
