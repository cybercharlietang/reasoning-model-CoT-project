    "text": " Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times that happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1= 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So 89. So total 49+50+89= 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many sets there are. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

How many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me recount the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500, but wait, up to 488, so the last hundred is 401-500, but we only go up to 488. However, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 fours, so 5 hundreds would give 50. But wait, the hundreds go up to 400-499, but the book ends at 488, so in the hundreds place, the 400-488 is 89 numbers, but for the tens place, it's still 10 in each hundred block. So, 10 per 100, and there are 5 hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500), but in 401-500, we only go up to 488, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is within 488. So, yes, 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50=99+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which only goes up to 488, so 8 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers? Wait, no. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last hundred. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. Wait, that's 98 eights. But let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th term because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 terms. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included. So, the count is 49, just like the fours. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence, right?

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that range. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I had 49, and for 8's, also 49. That seems correct because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except possibly the last partial set. But since 488 is included, both 4 and 8 have 49 in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50, and for 8's, I had 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so only 9 eights in the tens place there.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's had 89, and 8's had 0. So, adding up, 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. So, 188-98=90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, let's count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total tens place 8's are 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total occurrences = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: the first is 8, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? It's like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that right? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the number of times 4 appears in the units place. The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So that's correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the tens digit? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400-488 includes 400-409, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, using the same formula: floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480)/10=48, +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480-488: 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, that's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 instead of 10.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place.

Wait, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each of them has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Fours:188.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? If I divide 488 by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except maybe the last one.

So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Similarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 plus 9 gives 49. So, the calculation seems right.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check the tens place. The blocks are 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of that. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

For fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, eights total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50. That seems right. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I just thought, does 488 count as a page? Yes, it's included. So, when counting units place for eights, 488 is included, so that's correct. Similarly, for fours, 484 is included. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights, not 10.

    "text": " Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it includes 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, which is correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nFor fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n-6=484. So, 10n=490, n=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours in tens place.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is 48*10 +8, so 49 numbers.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nThus, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see: the first is 8, the last is 488. How many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48, but let's check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

The last one is 488, so let's see. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). Wait, so the last block only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899.
