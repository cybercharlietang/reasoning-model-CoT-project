Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For hundreds place in fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For hundreds place in eights: none, correct. Units place: both fours and eights have 49 occurrences? Wait, for fours in units, I had 484 as the last, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. For eights in units, up to 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers, correct.

That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90.

    "text": " So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.
