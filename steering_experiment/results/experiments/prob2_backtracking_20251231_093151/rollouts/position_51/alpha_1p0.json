    "text": " So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total is 98. So, 98 eights. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers. Wait, but let me go back and check if I made any mistakes. For fours: units place, I thought 49, but wait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. So, the last one is 484, which is the 49th term because (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: same as fours, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units and tens each have 49, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90.

Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers, from 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the 49th number because (484 -4)/10 +1=48.4, which is 49. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1=48. So, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check again for the units place of fours. The units digit is 4 every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights in units place: from 8 to 488, step 10. So, ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place of fours: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, 5 sets, 10 each, 50. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set has 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 except the last, which contributes 9.  \n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

The tens digit is 8 in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4 sets x10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total is 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place, we had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That adds up.\n\nUnits place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so up to 484. 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nUnits place for eights: same logic, up to 488, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since page numbers don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, because 488 is less than 800, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, correct. So, the counts seem right. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.

    "text": " Wait, no, because the book only goes up to 488, which is in the 400s, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, number of eights in hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place had 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens, 49 in units, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem is to find how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90.

    "text": " Wait, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems right. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is correct because 440 is within 488. But for eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right. Therefore, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
