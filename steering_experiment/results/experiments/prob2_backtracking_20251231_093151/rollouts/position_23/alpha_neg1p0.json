    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, that's actually five blocks, but the last one isn't complete. Let me think again. From 1-100: tens place 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). From 101-200: same, 10 times (140-149). Similarly, 201-300: 10 times (240-249). 301-400: 10 times (340-349). Now, 401-488: the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count each block. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189: 10. From 201-300: 280-289: 10. From 301-400: 380-389: 10. From 401-488: 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours. So, that's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens place can also have 4's in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens place has 8's in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, tens place adds 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Let's see how many full blocks we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 488-400+1 = 89 numbers in the 400-488 range. Wait, no, actually, the 400-488 range is 89 numbers, but for the tens place, we're looking at how many times 4 appears in the tens place. So, in each full hundred, from 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Now, in the partial hundred from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, 440-449, right? Wait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is 4 in any number where the second digit is 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers (400-409) and 10 numbers (440-449), totaling 20 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's 20 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 4 full hundreds *10 =40, plus 20 from the partial hundred, totaling 60 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. So, that's 10 +10 =20 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 +20=60. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place fours:89. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) =49+60=109+89=198. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49+60=109, plus 89 is 198? That seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10=48.4, so 48 full tens, but including 484, that's 49 numbers. So, units place:49. Tens place: each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10), so 20, so total tens:60. Hundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total fours:49+60+89=198. Now, let me check if this makes sense. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Okay, seems correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place eights:49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (0-99,100-199, etc.) has 10 occurrences (80-89). So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Now, in the partial hundred from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place eights:0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:198, total eights:98. The difference is 198-98=100. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: units=49, tens=60, hundreds=89. 49+60=109, +89=198. Counting eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 198-98=100. Hmm, seems correct. Wait, but let me verify the tens place for fours again. I had 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10), so 20. So, 40+20=60. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, in 400-488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 198-98=100. Therefore, there are 100 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred (e.g., 0-99, 100-199), 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - For 400-488, 4 appears in the tens place in 400-409 and 440-449, adding 20 occurrences.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 20 = 60 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 60 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 198.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - For 400-488, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, adding 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n198 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 100.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{100}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's five sets. But wait, in each of the first four sets (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens place has 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens place has 4 for 10 numbers (440-449), but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's another 10. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me double-check. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the book's page limit. Let's count each set. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers are there here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place has 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

No, because 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so it's 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 4 full hundred blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens place is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only part of the 480-489 range, which is within 488. So, let's count each block: - 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 eights in the tens place. - 101-200: 180-189, another 10 eights. - 201-300: 280-289, another 10. - 301-400: 380-389, another 10. - 401-488: Now, the tens place is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check: 4 blocks of 10 eights and one block of 9 eights, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me go back. Wait, when counting the hundreds place for fours, I said 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But 400 is the first number with a hundreds digit of 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That seems correct. Similarly, for the tens place, I had 50 fours, which seems correct because each hundred block had 10, and the last block (401-488) had another 10. Wait, but in the tens place, the last block (401-488) is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so that's 10 numbers, so yes, 10 fours. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the fours in the tens place. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are four full hundred blocks up to 400, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10, making it 50. That seems correct. Units place: 49 fours, correct. Hundreds place: 89 fours, correct. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: units place 49, tens place 49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought the answer might be lower. Let me try another approach: perhaps using a formula or counting digit positions more systematically. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position is to consider how many times each digit appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + (if the last number in the units place is >=4, add 1). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, floor(488/10)=48. Now, since the last number in the units place is 488, which ends with 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since the last number ends with 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49 eights in the units place. That matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Similarly, for eights in the tens place: each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. That also matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 89 fours. For eights, the hundreds digit would be 8 for numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, so according to this, there are 90 more fours than eights. But I'm a bit concerned because I thought the answer might be different. Let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small table to count the number of fours and eights in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the total number of digits used and see if this makes sense. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of fours and eights in each position again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 (as above)\n- Tens place: 50 (as above)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (as above)\nTotal: 188\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in fours: in each hundred block, 10 fours in the tens place, and in the last block, 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 4*10 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the tens place for eights. Let me check again. In the tens place, eights appear in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nSo, 80-89: 10 numbers\n180-189: 10\n280-289: 10\n380-389: 10\n480-488: 9 numbers\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the count seems accurate. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me think differently: maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- For 488 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, and then we check the remainder. 488 mod 10 is 8, so digits 0-8 appear 48 times, and digit 9 appears 48 times as well because 488 is less than 490. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last number, which ends with 8. So, for units digit, digits 0-8 each appear 49 times, and digit 9 appears 48 times because 488 is less than 489. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The number of times each digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as:\n\nFor each digit d from 0 to 9:\n\n- Count = floor(N / 10) + (1 if d <= (N % 10) else 0)\n\nSo, for N=488, N%10=8.\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nCount = floor(488/10) + (1 if 4 <=8 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nCount = 48 + (1 if 8<=8 else 0) = 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nEach digit d appears in the tens place:\n\nCount = floor(N / 100) * 10 + (if the last two digits are >= d*10 and < (d+1)*10, add the extra).\n\nWait, maybe a better way is:\n\nFor the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\n- For each hundred block, 10 times (e.g., 0-9 in the units place for each d in the tens place).\n\n- Then, for the remaining numbers beyond the last complete hundred block, if the last two digits are >= d*10, add the extra.\n\nSo, for N=488:\n\n- Number of complete hundreds: floor(488 / 100) = 4 (since 4*100=400).\n\n- So, for each d, the count is 4*10=40.\n\n- Then, for the last partial hundred (401-488), we need to see how many times d appears in the tens place.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10, making total 50.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nIn the last partial hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, add 9, making total 49.\n\nThat's consistent with earlier counts.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- For d=4, it appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n- For d=8, it doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fours is 188, and the total number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because I thought maybe the answer would be lower, but perhaps it's correct. Let me just check another way: maybe by writing a small program or using another counting method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- As above, 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nEights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 from the first four hundreds plus 10 from the last partial hundred: 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, so let me check each hundred: - 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189:10. - 200-299:280-289:10. - 300-399:380-389:10. - 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, the first four hundreds contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90. But let me check my counts again because sometimes I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check that again. For tens place eights: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place:49, so total 98. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. But wait, let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Yes. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-4 in the hundreds place).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200 has 140-149, another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there up to 488? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 401-488. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 100, 200, 300, 400. That's four sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last set, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. Wait, that's part of the 400s, but actually, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's already included in the four sets. So, total fours in the tens place: 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from all places: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, total fours printed: 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers? Let's divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 8 \u00d7 61 = 488, so that's the 61st occurrence. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the last number is 488. Wait, 488 is 48 \u00d7 10 + 8, so the number of 8's in the units place is 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-500: 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last set contributes 9. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10. 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10. 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10. 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 488 is included). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights from all places: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80. So, there are 80 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set of 100 contributes 10, totaling 40, plus 10 more in 440-449, but since 440-449 is within 400-488, it's already counted, so 40.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each set of 100 contributes 10, totaling 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 80.\n\n$\\boxed{80}$"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (like 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have? We have 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but let me think again. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's included. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place as well. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9. So, the tens place in 400-488 has 9 eights. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last block is only up to 488, not 499. So, in 400-488, how many tens places have 4? Let's see: 400-409: 10 numbers, 410-419: 10, 420-429: 10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10, and then 450-488. Wait, but 450-488: the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no 4's in the tens place beyond 449. So, from 400-449, each hundred has 100 numbers, but in the tens place, each 100 has 10 occurrences. So, 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-449:10. Wait, but 400-449 is 50 numbers, so the tens place is 4 for 40-49, 140-149, etc., but in 400-449, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. Wait, actually, in 400-449, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred, but in 400-449, it's 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets of 10 each, which is 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 0-99, 100-199, etc., each have 10, so 4 hundreds (0-399) plus the 400-449. Wait, 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-449:10? Wait, no, because 400-449 is only 50 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers in each ten's place. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. For the tens place, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times. So, from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So total tens place 4's: 4 hundreds (0-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 50 from 400-449, so total 90? Wait, that can't be right because 400-449 is only 50 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 in 50 numbers (5 sets of 10). So, maybe it's 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 0-99, 100-199, etc., each have 10, so 4 hundreds would give 40, and then 400-449 adds another 50, making 90. But that seems high because up to 488, the total number of tens places with 4 would be 40 (from 0-399) plus 50 (from 400-449), totaling 90. Hmm, but let me check with an example. For 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, so 20 up to 199. 240-249: another 10, 30 up to 299. 340-349: another 10, 40 up to 399. Then, 400-409: 10, 410-419:10, 420-429:10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So total tens place 4's: 40 (from 0-399) +50 (from 400-449)=90. Wait, but 400-449 is only 50 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 for 50 numbers (5 sets of 10). So, yes, 50. So total tens place 4's: 40+50=90. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (90) + hundreds (89)=49+90=139+89=228. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times (since 488 includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence). Tens place: as above, 90 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So total 4's:49+90+89=228. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many. Each hundred block (0-99,100-199, etc.) has 10 occurrences in the tens place for 8. So, 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 228-98=130. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my calculations again to be sure. For 4's: units=49, tens=90, hundreds=89. Total=228. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=228-98=130. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 130 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 228, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 228 - 98 = 130.\n\n$\\boxed{130}$"

Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 450-488 doesn't have a 4 in the tens place. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, we can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. (488 - 8) = 480, 480/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. 401-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, but maybe I was wrong. Let me recount: from 1-99, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.

The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 10n -6, where n starts at 1. Wait, 4=10\u00d71 -6=4, 14=10\u00d72 -6=14, etc. The last term is 484, which is 10n -6=484 \u2192 10n=490 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Tens place: As I thought, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, starting from 8, each step is +10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets? From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought units and tens each had 49, so 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me recount the fours and eights. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), which is correct because 440-449 is within 488. So, 5\u00d710=50 fours in tens place. For eights, in the tens place, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: both fours and eights have 49 each. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\left(\\frac{484 - 4}{10}\\right) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens digit for the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds digit for pages 400-488. The number of pages is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   \n   Total 4's:\n   \\[\n   49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n   \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{488 - 8}{10}\\right) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit for the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\n   Total 8's:\n   \\[\n   49 + 49 = 98\n   \\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (40-49). So, from 1-400, how many hundreds do we have? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, how many fours are in the tens place? The numbers would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is 484. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 484 is included, it's 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, and then from 401-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 more, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 40 (from 1-400) +9=49. Units place: 49. So total eights:98. So the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five sets, but the last set is only up to 488. For the tens place, in each full hundred, like 1-99, 100-199, etc., there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-399, that's four sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 of them. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, I can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. Here, last = 488, first = 8, step = 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (like 1-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-399, that's four sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place contributes 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, the 8 appears 9 times in 480-488, but in the full hundreds before that, like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1). So, 484 -4 = 10*(n-1) \u2192 480 = 10*(n-1) \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. Correct, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets. Wait, earlier I thought from 1-399, which is four sets, and then 440-449 as the fifth set. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, the eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1). So, 488 -8 = 480 = 10*(n-1) \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. Total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as there are no pages beyond 488. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check if I'm counting correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me recount that.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, I have 5 sets where the tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and 9 in 480-488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place for fours, I'm including 488? 488 is page 488, which is included in the 400-488 range, so yes, it's counted in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484, which is 49 numbers (since (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100, 101-200) contributes 10 occurrences.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens place can be 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, that makes sense. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so in the tens place, 400-488 will have 10 fours (440-449). So, yes, 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units place 8's go up to 488. Let's count how many. The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. To find how many terms, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 0-99: 80-89: 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, five sets. In each of the first four sets (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, the last set is 400-488. Here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as follows: The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1). So, 488 = 8 + 10*(n-1). Subtract 8: 480 = 10*(n-1). Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: How many numbers here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 10 numbers each for five sets, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers.

From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so each range has 10 fours in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place will have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. To find how many, I can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each full set (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, how many full sets are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each with 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 more times. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems off because when I added the tens place, I had 49, but let me double-check. For the tens place, 80-89 is 10 eights, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10. That's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights, units: 49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the hundreds place for fours, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. But let me check if I included all the fours correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position. For a given digit d, in the units place up to N, it's floor(N/10) + something if the remainder is >=d. Similarly for tens, hundreds places. Maybe I can use that method to cross-verify. Let me try that for fours: 1. Units place: floor(488/10) = 48. Then, since the remainder is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49 fours in units place. That matches. 2. Tens place: floor(488/100) =4. Then, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40. But wait, in the hundreds place, we have 488, so the last hundred is 400-488. In the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 40-49 in each hundred, so in 0-99: 10 times, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours in the tens place in the 400-488 range. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct. 3. Hundreds place: floor((488 +1)/1000) =0, but since we're dealing with hundreds, it's floor(488/100)=4, but we need to see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now for eights: 1. Units place: floor(488/10)=48, remainder 8. Since the remainder is >=8, add 1, so 48+1=49 eights in units place. 2. Tens place: floor(488/100)=4. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. Hundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights:49+49=98. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - In the last range (400-488), 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 \\text{ (4's)} - 98 \\text{ (8's)} = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 1-400, there are four sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 1-400, there are four sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds place eights. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. There are 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many complete ranges we have. - 40-49: 10 numbers. - 140-149: 10 numbers. - 240-249: 10 numbers. - 340-349: 10 numbers. - 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count? The book goes up to 488, so yes, 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's subtract 399 from 488 to get the count. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, there are 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? There are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens place has 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, from 1-488, the 400-488 range is only 89 numbers. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-488, how many complete sets are there? 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens place has 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, from 400-488, we have 9 eights. Therefore, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for fours. I had 40 from the first four sets, then 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. That seems right. And for eights, in the tens place, 40 from the first four sets, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That also seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, which makes sense because up to 488, which is 488 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 in each place. Wait, but for units place, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 also appears 49 times. So, the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places. Fours have 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =139, while eights have 49 (tens). So, the difference is 139 - 49 =90. Yes, that's consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 0 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The 440-449 range adds another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488, inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 101-200: 10 fours (140-149). 201-300: 10 fours (240-249). 301-400: 10 fours (340-349). 401-488: Now, here, the tens place can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page. So, 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, that can't be right because 401-488 is only part of the 400s. Wait, let's think again. From 1-400, the tens place has 4 in each hundred block: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens place can be 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 488, so units digit is 8, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189: 10 eights. 201-300: 280-289: 10 eights. 301-400: 380-389: 10 eights. 401-488: 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 10, so 4*10=40. Then 440-449 in 401-488, which is another 10. So, 40+10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. So, ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set from 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems right. For eights, in the hundreds place, there are none because 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 0. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens place is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 40 +10=50? Wait, no, let me think again. From 1-400, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours are 40+10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4*10=40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So, total tens place eights are 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets with 10 each and 1 set with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Each of these ranges (40-49, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last range: 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's see how many ranges we have. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 eights each, and one range with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

We have 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so 4*10 = 40. Then, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is another 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1=8, common difference d=10, last term an=488. The formula for the nth term is an = a1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 do we have? Four complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four blocks, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place in the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights would be 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.

So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens place can be 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is greater than 400 and less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, which means 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (488 - 8) = 480; 480 / 10 = 48; 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count each block. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens place can be 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. Let's count how many: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 has tens digit 8, so that's 9 occurrences. So, the tens place eights are 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Each set (like 40-49) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such sets are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. To find how many, I can take 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, starting from 8, each step of 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the first four sets, each contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have? Let's see: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 times), 140-149 (10 times), 240-249 (10 times), 340-349 (10 times), and 440-449 (10 times). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that is. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 488, so that's another set.

So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, same for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Then 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10*4 +9 = 49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98.

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 count? Let's see. The last page is 488, so yes, 488 is included. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9). Wait, no, that's actually 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, each of these sets contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Units place for eights: 49, which is correct because 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400-488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting from 0, each 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 another 10. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 another 10. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 another 10. From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recount the tens place for 4's. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...484: that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: same logic, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block, which contributes 9. Total = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-99: 10 fours in the tens place (40-49). From 100-199: another 10 fours (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 10 fours (240-249). 300-399: 10 fours (340-349). Now, 400-488: the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I'm counting all the hundreds digits as 4, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So yes, 89 fours there. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each set from 0-99, 100-199, etc., has 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many eights here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for this range. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, maybe I overcounted. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 50. Let me check that again. Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) would be 4*10=40, plus 440-449, which is another 10, making it 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is the fifth set. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? Let's see, 484 is the last one. (484-4)/10 +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. To find the count, subtract 399 from 488, which gives 89. So, 89 numbers have 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

That's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 401-500 range, but our book stops at 488, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. Hmm, that seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Let me check: 8 is the 1st, 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 occurrences in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens place can have 8 in the 480-489 range. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many eights in the tens place here? Each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct?

So, let's calculate: - 0-99: 10 times (40-49)\n- 100-199: 10 times (140-149)\n- 200-299: 10 times (240-249)\n- 300-399: 10 times (340-349)\n- 400-488: 10 times (440-449)\nSo that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the units digit in 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block: - 0-99: 10 times (80-89)\n- 100-199: 10 times (180-189)\n- 200-299: 10 times (280-289)\n- 300-399: 10 times (380-389)\n- 400-488: 80-89 would be 10, but since we're only going up to 488, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, that's 9 numbers, not 10, because 480-489 would be 10, but we stop at 488, so it's 9. So, for the 400-488 range, the tens place has 9 eights. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (with the last block being 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences).\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, the number of complete hundreds is 4. But wait, the first hundred (1-99) has a tens place 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199 has 140-149, which is another 10. 200-299 has 240-249, another 10. 300-399 has 340-349, 10 again. 400-488 has 440-449, which is 10 as well. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred, so maybe I'm double-counting. Let me think again. Actually, each hundred from 1-100, 101-200, etc., up to 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is 401-500, but we only count up to 488. So, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours are 40+10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th. Wait, but 488 is the 49th multiple? Wait, 8,18,...,488. How many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, eights total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct because 488-400+1=89. And in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place:8,18,...,488:49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. That's correct. Tens place: each hundred has a 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, it's 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me count: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, gives (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each set contributes 10 eights, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 eights in the tens place for this set. So total tens place eights: 4 sets \u00d710 +1 set \u00d79=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 5 sets: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each with 10 eights, and the last set 480-488 with 9 eights, totaling 49. That seems correct. Units place: both fours and eights have 49 occurrences each. Wait, but for fours, units place is 49, and for eights, units place is 49. So, that's the same. The difference comes from the tens and hundreds places. Fours have 50 in tens and 89 in hundreds, while eights have 49 in tens and 0 in hundreds. So, the difference is (50+89) - (49) = 139 -49=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Let's see: 40-49 (first set), 140-149 (second), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me confirm: 40-49: 10 numbers, 10 fours. 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many terms is that? The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The nth term can be represented as 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. Wait, actually, it's 4 + 10(n-1). So, when does 4 + 10(n-1) = 484? Let's solve for n: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. For the tens place: as before, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each set contributes 10 fours. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 10 fours. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. That's correct. Now, hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first 8 is at 8, the last is at 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? Let's use the formula: the nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each set except the last contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. So, number of eights in tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me think again: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place). So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units (49), tens (49). 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. Units place for fours: 49, correct. For eights: units place is 49, correct. Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488), totaling 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers. Wait, but I'm only counting the number of 4's in the hundreds place, which is 89. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's see: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). But wait, 400-488: does 480-489 count? But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 would be part of it, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but I'm considering the tens place. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but I thought earlier it would be 4 sets, but now it's 5 sets. Wait, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, the total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a lot, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90. Hmm, but I feel like 90 is a lot, but maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. That's correct because 400 is the first, and 488 is the last, so 488-400+1=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449, but in the 8's, I included 480-488. So, in the 4's, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. For 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: for the tens place, 4's have 5 sets of 10, so 50, and 8's have 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 49. So, 50 vs 49. Similarly, units place is same for both, 49 each. Hundreds place is 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. So, 89 more 4's in hundreds place, and 1 more in tens place, so total 90 more 4's. So, I think the answer is 90. But wait, let me check if I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any ranges.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps it's easier to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- For 4's: every 10 numbers, so total numbers is floor(488/10)=48 full decades, and then check if the last partial decade has a 4 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1 four in units place, so 48. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 is 48*10=480, so 480-488 is the 49th decade. So, in each decade, the units digit is 4 once. So, total units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- For 4's: each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. From 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\n- For 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
