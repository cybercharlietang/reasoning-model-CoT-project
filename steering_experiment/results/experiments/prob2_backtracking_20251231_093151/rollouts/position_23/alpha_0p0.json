    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers per block. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? There are four complete blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more fours. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes one 4, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me make sure. From 400 to 488, every number has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many complete blocks of 100 we have up to 488. There are four complete blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these blocks has a set where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers per block. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, so fours are 188 and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the ranges. Let me verify the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, earlier I thought it was 4 blocks before 400, but actually, 400-499 would have 440-449 as part of the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens place is separate. Let me think: in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. 401-488: 440-449, 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5\u00d710=50. So, that's correct. So, tens place is 50 fours. Units place is 49, hundreds place is 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, for eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. That's correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 eights, and in the last partial block, 480-488, it's 9 eights. So, number of blocks: 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial set from 401-488. Each complete set contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the partial set 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours in the tens place here. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would be 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the partial set 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's see how many there are. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: starting from 8, each 10 numbers add another 8 in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last number is beyond 480. Wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, the 49th occurrence is at 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. Each 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But earlier, I thought from 1-400, it's 4 blocks. Wait, 400 is included in 400-409? Wait, no, 400-409 would be hundreds place 4, but the tens place 4 is in 440-449. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. The tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's are 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct. Now for the 8's. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 units +49 tens +0 hundreds=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, which is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except the last one which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full sets? From 1-400, we have 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many full sets of 100 are there? There are 4 full sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 4 for 40-49, which is another 10 numbers (400-409). Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 400s. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-409 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 full sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a set where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count how many times 8 appears in each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89) = 188. For eights: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0) = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. And in the tens place, for 4's, I had 5 blocks of 10, which is 50. Units place, 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Yeah, that seems right.

Let's see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me verify: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 eights. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1 to 400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40 fours. Now, from 400 to 488, the tens place is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, which is another 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-488), totaling 50 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: from 1-99, the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, that makes sense. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / difference) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So units place is 49. Tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place: 89. So total fours: 49 +50 +89= 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units place 8's go up to 488. So, how many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40, and then 480-488 contributes 9, so total 49. So tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because units and tens both have 49 each, so 98 eights in total. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check the counting to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99, there are 10 such numbers (40-49). From 100-199, another 10 (140-149). From 200-299, another 10 (240-249). From 300-399, another 10 (340-349). From 400-488, how many? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing a 4 in the units place, plus the 484, which is the 49th. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 (since 440-449). So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place, plus 488 itself, which is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 1-99:80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488-480+1=9. So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49+49+0=98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly. For the tens place eights, I had 10 in each hundred except the last one, which had 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9: 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights:98. Fours:188. Difference:90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8 = 488. So, the count is 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's count each block: From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, the first 100 pages are 1-100, then 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? Let's see: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit being 8. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, does the book go beyond 389? Yes, up to 488. So, from 1-400, we have 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), but wait, 80-89 is in the first block, 180-189 in the second, 280-289 in the third, and 380-389 in the fourth. So, that's 4 blocks, each giving 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. Therefore, tens place eights are 40 (from 1-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought each block gives 10, but in the last block, it's only 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98.

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.

Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 49. Wait, let me check: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (like 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? There are 4 complete sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so the tens place in 400-488 would be from 400-488. Let me think again. Actually, each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. 401-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10. So, 5\u00d710=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, but 488 is included as the 49th occurrence. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 \u2192 9 numbers). Wait, is that correct? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and 1 set of 9 (from 401-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, I'm only interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8 appears in 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, 10. From 201-300: 280-289, 10. From 301-400: 380-389, 10. From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's add them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many full hundreds do we have? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 401-488. So, in each hundred, there's a set where the tens digit is 4. So, 100-199: 10 times (40-49), 200-299: 10 times (140-149), 300-399: 10 times (240-249), 400-488: 10 times (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total for tens place is 4 sets * 10 = 40. But wait, is that correct? Let me check: from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that. So, actually, there are 5 sets where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 sets. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me list them: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 times. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think again. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. For the tens place, as I thought, 5 sets of 10, so 50. For the units place, from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, so 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, each of these sets contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I thought there were 5 sets of 10, but actually, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let me do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets, each with 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. Total 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the counts again to be sure. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484 is the last one. (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. For eights: Units place: 8 to 488, stepping by 10. (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). 4 sets, 10 each, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, yes, 89 eights. So, 188 -89=99.

Thus, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 instances, and there are 4 such blocks up to 380-389. Thus, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 89 = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10). From 201-300: 240-249 (10). From 301-400: 340-349 (10). From 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only counting the hundreds digit, which is 4 in all these numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 0 to 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and 9 from 401-488. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90. But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for fours. Let me check again. For units place fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. For tens place fours: each hundred has 10, and we have 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, 5 x 10 = 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Correct. So, 49 + 49 = 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently, by considering each digit position separately and using a formula. For the units digit: in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. So, total units fours: floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is >=4. Since 488 ends with 8, which is less than 4? Wait, no, the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, 484 is the last number where units digit is 4. So, number of units fours is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for the tens digit: in each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 40 +10=50. Correct. For hundreds digit: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units digit. Each block of 10 has one 8. The last 8 in the units place is at 488, so number of units eights is (488 - 8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens digit: in each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens eights: 40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds digit: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, I think my initial calculation was correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, so yes, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks? 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks contribute 4 * 10 = 40 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the tens place in 4's, I had 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, totaling 50. But let me check: from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50, which is correct.\n\nFor the units place in 4's: up to 488, so 484 is the last 4 in units place. 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers, correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place in 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n\nUnits place: same as fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9=49, correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, correct.\n\nSo total fours: 49+50+89=188\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something, but checking again, it seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 401-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then 488 itself, which is the 49th. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, so that's valid. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the last block, 480-488, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and 1 block of 9 (from 401-488). So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is only up to 488. Let me clarify: - 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. - 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. - 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. - 400-488: 440-449 is 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 400-488 include 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count: - 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. - 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. - 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. - 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, total in the tens place: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in the tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems correct. But let me check the tens place for eights again. The sets are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10\u00d74=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Since 484 is the 49th occurrence, units place has 49 fours. Similarly, units place for eights: 8,18,...,488, which is also 49 eights. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, adding up, fours total 188, eights total 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Yes, because 8 is in the units place of 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 0-488, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each contributes 10 eights except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.

Wait, actually, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), and 340-349 (another 10), so that's 40 numbers. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me make sure: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets are within 488. Each set is 10 numbers. From 1-400, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), and 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from 1-400) plus 9 (from 400-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Checking 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

This is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149 is another 10. From 201-300, 240-249 is another 10. From 301-400, 340-349 is another 10. From 401-488, 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4s in units is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >= 4. 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488/10 = 48.8, so floor is 48. But 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 80-89 is 10. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 numbers. That's 4*10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check: 400 is included, so 488 is the last page. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's correct. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds: 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's see: From 1-400, we have 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, so fours are 188 and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? The formula is floor((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 49 +50 +89=188 fours. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, how many? (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds place is 4 only in the numbers 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40.

Each full block contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (like 40-49). So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.

So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many that is. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. Let's count each block. Each complete hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens place is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Units place fours: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. Difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40  \n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 440-449 (10)  \n   Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40  \n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 480-488 (9)  \n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is given by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The last term is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place. So, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89 (10). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but the book stops at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 480-488 block contributes 9 eights instead of 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 eights (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 eights (480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in each hundred, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which is only up to 488. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets give 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus the last set gives 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Because in 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4 hundreds would give 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.

So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is not a complete hundred. So, let me correct that. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set of 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10 fours, same for 240-249 and 340-349. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 4 x 10 = 40 fours. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place fours: 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149: 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249: 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349: 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449: 10 fours. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10 eights. 280-289: 10 eights. 380-389: 10 eights. 480-488: 9 eights (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, +89 = 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49 +49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's correct. And in the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, yes, 188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49. So, 98 eights. Therefore, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct. Similarly, for the tens place, in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 0-99:40-49:10 fours. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours. So, 49 +50 +89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4x10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 301-400: 340-349 (10). From 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from the first four blocks) plus 9, which is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 eights, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for eights would have some numbers, but no, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me adjust. The first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each have 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 401-488 block, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours are units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights are units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, there are four such blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349.

So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10). That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 400-488, does the tens digit ever reach 8? Yes, in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, adding that, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 in units place occurs at 8, 18, ..., 488.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens place can have 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. This gives 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10). From 201-300: 240-249 (10). From 301-400: 340-349 (10). From 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each block. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (1st digit):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place (2nd digit):** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place (3rd digit):** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (1st digit):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place (2nd digit):** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place (3rd digit):** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
