    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers, correct. Then 101-200: another 10, etc. So, that's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? Let me calculate: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is 4. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 ends with 8, not 4, so it's 48 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, how many 4's in the units place? 480/10 = 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So, total units place fours are 48. So, I think I was wrong earlier; it's 48, not 49. So, units: 48. Tens place: let's see, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488: how many? From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Wait, so earlier I thought 188, but now it's 187. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again. Units place: 48 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total fours: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) and 9 in 401-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 187, number of eights is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and 488 ends with 8).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 4 sets of 10 and 9 additional numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds do we have? The first hundred (1-100) has 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The second hundred (101-200) has 140-149, another 10. The third hundred (201-300) has 240-249, another 10. The fourth hundred (301-400) has 340-349, another 10. The fifth hundred would be 401-500, but our book ends at 488, so we only go up to 488. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but from 40-49 is 10, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 sets, but now I'm seeing 5 sets. Let me check again. From 0-100: 40-49: 10 fours. 100-200: 140-149: 10. 200-300: 240-249: 10. 300-400: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Okay, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 4,14,...,484: that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? From 0-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-200: 180-189: 10. 200-300: 280-289:10. 300-400: 380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. In the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each 10, so 5*10=50. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: 49 units +49 tens=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 sets. But wait, the 400-488 set only goes up to 488, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, actually, no. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. From 1-99: 40-49: 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149: 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249: 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349: 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449: 10 fours. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, that seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the book's pages. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89: 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189: 10 eights. 200-299: 280-289: 10 eights. 300-399: 380-389: 10 eights. 400-488: 480-488: How many eights here? The tens digit is 8, so numbers from 480 to 488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, adding up: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five sets. But wait, the last set is only up to 488, so the tens digit in 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, which is less than a full hundred. But since 440-449 is a full set, that's still 10 numbers. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 eights, and the last partial hundred contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4 full hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I said 5 sets of 10, but wait, the hundreds go up to 488, so in the hundreds place, the tens digit in 440-449 is 4, which is correct. So, 5 sets: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, yes, 49 units place. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set has 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. The last block would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. How many blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're dealing with the tens place, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundreds digit, there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 have tens digits 5-8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the blocks are: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. For example, in 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. In 100-199: 140-149 is 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let's check: from 1-488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, eights total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is the last number in the book, so that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? Let me check again. The tens place for 8's: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, we had 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10), totaling 50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, the total fours are indeed 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, actually, from 0-400, it's 4 full sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's included. So, 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, actually, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers.

So, each full set of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, we have 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from 1-400) +9=49 eights. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9. So, total in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90.

So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?

Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 and 410-419, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 410-419 is another 10, so total 20 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, 400-488 includes up to 488, so 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, 420-429 is another 10, but wait, 420-429 would have tens digit 2, not 4. Wait, no, 400-499 would have the tens digit 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, etc., but since we're only going up to 488, let's see. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so up to 488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, each set from 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 470-479 is 10 numbers, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear in 400-488? Let's see: 400-409: 10 numbers. 410-419: 10. 420-429: 10. 430-439: 10. 440-449: 10. 450-459: 10. 460-469: 10. 470-479: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So that's 8 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 8*10 + 9 = 89? Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 pages, but the tens digit 4 appears in each of those ranges. Wait, but each range where the tens digit is 4 is 10 numbers, except the last one which is 9. So, total tens digit 4 in 400-488 is 8*10 + 9 = 89? Wait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so the tens digit 4 appears 9 times in the tens place? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit is 4 for each set of 10 numbers. So, for example, in 400-409, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 410-419, etc. But in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, not 4. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this. The tens digit is 4 when the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds place. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for the ranges where the tens digit is 4. So, that would be 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, 480-488 is the last part. However, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, the tens digit is 4 only in the ranges where the tens digit is 4, which are 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so that's 8 ranges * 10 = 80 numbers where the tens digit is 4 in the 400-488 range. So, in total, the tens digit 4 appears 80 times in 400-488. Now, adding up the tens digit 4 from all hundreds: 0-99: 10 times. 100-199: 10. 200-299: 10. 300-399: 10. 400-488: 80. So total tens digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 80 = 120. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479: that's 8 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 80. So total tens digit 4's: 10*4 (from the first four hundreds) + 80 = 40 + 80 = 120. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (120) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 120 + 89. Let's calculate that: 49 + 120 = 169; 169 + 89 = 258. So, total number of 4's printed is 258.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred block, except the last one, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10.\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10.\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10.\n- 400-488: 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 10*4 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 258 - 98 = 160.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 (correct, as 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers).\n- Tens place: 120 (from 10 per hundred for four hundreds and 80 in the 400-488 range). Wait, earlier I thought 400-488 had 80 tens digit 4's, but let me confirm. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479. That's 8 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 80. So, 10 per hundred for four hundreds (0-399) gives 40, plus 80 in 400-488, total 120. That seems correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488). So, 49 + 120 + 89 = 258. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10). Correct.\n- Tens place: 49. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 258 - 98 = 160.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 160 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 258, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 258 - 98 = 160.\n\n\\boxed{160}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400s. So, in each hundred, the tens place has 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, for 4 hundreds, that would be 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last hundred is 401-500, but our book stops at 488. So, in the 400s, the tens place 4's go from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40. Wait, no, because each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers), 101-200: 140-149 (10), 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10), and 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 5 * 10 = 50. Hmm, I think that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many complete sets we have. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers), 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10), and 401-488: 480-488. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four sets contribute 4 * 10 = 40, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. That would be the number of 4's minus the number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10. So, 5 * 10 = 50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last set is 9, so total 49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: 4's have 49, 8's have 49. So, that's correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Hundreds place for 8's: none, as the book ends at 488. So, 0. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which we take as 49, but actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4's go up to 484, which is 484 - 4 / 10 + 1 = 48.4 + 1, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 49. So, 49 units place fours. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 tens place fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. For 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in this range.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's divide 488 by 10: 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 8 is the first, so 8 + 48*10 = 8 + 480 = 488. So, that's 49 numbers (including both 8 and 488). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four sets are complete, each contributing 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.

So, that's 4 sets with 10 each, so 40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is the fifth set, but only 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484, making it 49. That's correct. Tens place: as above, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Wait, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. Hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. For the tens place, 50 fours, and units place 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. For eights: units place 49, tens place 49, so total 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1, 2, 3, or 4. But for the tens place, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundreds digit (0,1,2,3,4), there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait: does the last block go up to 449? Because 488 is the last page. So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the last page is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, 480 is the 48th multiple of 10, and 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this block. So, each block of 100 numbers has a tens digit of 8 in 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 480-488: 9 eights (since 489 is beyond 488).\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's 49. But let me check: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours. That seems right because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, wait, earlier I thought it was 5 blocks, but let me check: for the tens digit, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10, since 449 is within 488). So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the eights:\n\n- Units place:49 eights. Correct, as from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, which is 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.\n- Tens place: Let's recount. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n- Hundreds place:0, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 fours.\n   - Total: 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - There are 89 such numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributing 10 eights each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 more pages. So, for each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 sets would give 4*10=40 fours. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then from 450-488, the tens digit isn't 4 anymore. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, we only have 440-449 as the tens place with 4, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 4 sets of 10, but wait, let me think again. Wait, the first 100 pages (1-100) have 40-49 as the first set, that's 10 fours in the tens place. The next 100 (101-200) have 140-149, another 10. Then 201-300 have 240-249, another 10. Then 301-400 have 340-349, another 10. Then 401-488: here, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, giving 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so does that affect it? No, because 440-449 is within 488. So, tens place has 50 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 sets, but actually, from 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " For each hundred, there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 0-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is within 488. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's calculate how many eights in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck the count of 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct. For the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, each giving 10 fours, so 50. Units place, 49 fours. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188, which seems correct. For the 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct, but I thought maybe I was missing something. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me try a different approach: using a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated by considering each digit position separately. For each position, the count is based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. But maybe that's more complicated, but let me try for units place. For 4's in units place: The total number is floor(488/10) + (if the last digit >=4, add 1). Wait, floor(488/10) is 48, and since 488's units digit is 8 >=4, add 1, so 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10) is 48, and since units digit is 8, add 1, so 48 +1=49. Correct. For tens place, 4's: Let's see, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. Wait, but in the tens place, the count for each hundred is 10. So, for 0-399, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place: Similarly, for 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4 x 10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: For 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. For 8's, there are no hundreds digits of 8 because the book ends at 488. So, 0. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. Total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake earlier, but after checking, it seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should list out some numbers to confirm. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That's correct. In the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., each contributes 10 fours, and 440-449 is another 10, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. So, 188 fours. For 8's, units place:8,18,...,488:49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: each of the first four blocks has 10, and the last has 9, totaling 49. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for each hundred, that's 10 fours. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is the 49th). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for this set. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4x10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and then 9 in the last block. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 101-200, 140-149: another 10. From 201-300, 240-249: another 10. From 301-400, 340-349: another 10. Then from 401-488, we have 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189: 10. From 201-300: 280-289: 10. From 301-400: 380-389: 10. From 401-488: 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Units place for 4's: 49, tens place: 50, so 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 8's: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. Let me see: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. Similarly, ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49.

But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, so dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first in 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 9 occurrences, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4, so we have 4 sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 400-488. So, how many complete sets of 100 do we have where the tens digit is 4? The first set is 40-49 in the 0-99 range, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 in 100-199, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each have 10. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So that's 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each step is +10. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, 49 numbers. Wait, but 8 + 48*10 = 8 + 480 = 488, which is the 49th term. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each complete hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 10, 100-199: 10, 200-299: 10, 300-399: 10, and 400-488: 9. So, 10*4 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each complete hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, the first four blocks are 10 each, and the last block is 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.

The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many blocks there are.

So, for the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.

Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, yes, 5 sets times 10 is 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. But wait, let me check again because 4 in the hundreds place only goes up to 488, which is 89 numbers. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's check for the digit 8. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, meaning 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. Let's count each set: - From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. - From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. - From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. - From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought units place had 49 and tens place had 49, so total 98. Now, let me compare the number of fours and eights. Number of fours: 188. Number of eights: 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets. So, 5*10=50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like this might not be right because 488 is a three-digit number, and maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me try another approach: count the number of fours and eights in each position separately, making sure not to include numbers beyond 488. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit position up to 488. Let me try that. For the units place: For fours, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so floor(488/10)=48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last number, and 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place, from 1 to 488, how many? It's also every 10 numbers, so floor(488/10)=48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But 488 is included, so the last 8 in units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place. Now, for the tens place: For fours, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488? Each block of 100 numbers has a 10-number block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, 10. From 200-299: 240-249, 10. From 300-399: 340-349, 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 449 is less than 488. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. For eights in the tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has a 10-number block where the tens digit is 8. From 0-99: 80-89, 10. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Now, for the hundreds place: For fours, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, eights in hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up: Fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188. Eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting the same result again. Maybe I'm correct after all. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position up to a certain number. Let me try that approach. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the k-th position (units, tens, hundreds) up to number N is a bit involved, but I can try to apply it here. Let's denote N=488, and we're looking for digit 4 and 8. Let's break down each digit position.\n\n**Units place (k=1):**\n\nFor digit d=4:\n- The number of full cycles is floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each full cycle contributes 1 occurrence.\n- The remainder is 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1 more occurrence.\n- So, total fours in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nFor digit d=8:\n- Full cycles: floor(488/10)=48, each contributes 1.\n- Remainder: 8 >=8, so add 1.\n- Total eights in units place:48+1=49.\n\n**Tens place (k=2):**\n\nFor digit d=4:\n- The divisor is 100 (since we're in the tens place).\n- Full cycles: floor(488 / 100)=4. Each full cycle contributes 10 occurrences (since the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers).\n- The remainder is 488 % 100=88. Now, we look at the tens digit in the remainder: floor(88 /10)=8. Since 8 >=4, we add (8 -4 +1)*10? Wait, no. The formula is a bit different. Let me recall. The formula is:\n  - high = N / (divisor * 10)\n  - current = (N / divisor) % 10\n  - low = N % divisor\n  - if current > d: count += (high +1) * divisor\n  - else if current ==d: count += high * divisor + low +1\n  - else: count += high * divisor\nSo, for tens place, divisor=10, but since we're in the tens place, the divisor should be 100. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me clarify. The standard digit counting formula uses the position to determine the divisor. For units place, divisor=1; tens place, divisor=10; hundreds place, divisor=100, etc. But when calculating for the tens place, the divisor is 10, but the higher part is N divided by 100, and the lower part is N modulo 10. Hmm, maybe I should use the standard digit counting approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to count manually as I did before, but let's try applying the formula for the tens place.\n\nFor digit d=4 in tens place:\n\n- divisor = 10 (since we're in the tens place)\n- higher = floor(488 / (10 * 10)) = floor(488/100)=4\n- current = floor(488 /10) %10=48%10=8\n- lower = 488 %10=8\n\nNow, since current digit (8) > d (4), the count is (higher +1) * divisor.\n\nSo, (4 +1)*10=5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\n- higher = floor(488/100)=4\n- current = floor(488/10)%10=48%10=8\n- lower =488%10=8\n\nSince current == d, count is higher * divisor + lower +1.\n\nSo, 4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49.\n\nSo, that matches our earlier counts: 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n**Hundreds place (k=3):**\n\nFor digit d=4:\n\n- divisor=100\n- higher = floor(488 / (100*10))=floor(488/1000)=0\n- current = floor(488/100)%10=4%10=4\n- lower=488%100=88\n\nSince current ==d, count is higher * divisor + lower +1.\n\nSo, 0*100 +88 +1=89.\n\nFor d=8 in hundreds place:\n\n- higher=0\n- current=4\n- lower=88\n- Since current <8, count is higher * divisor=0.\n\nSo, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the counts again:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still getting 90. Maybe that's the correct answer. Let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a different method to verify, but since I can't do that right now, I'll have to rely on my calculations.\n\nWait, but when I think about the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, since the book ends at 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for fours, we have 5 sets of 10, which is 50. For eights, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nSo, adding up, fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 300-399: 340-349, 10. From 400-488: 440-449, that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total of 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 1-99, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 1-99: 10 fours in tens place. 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:10 (440-449). So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So yes, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place eights: 10 +10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10*4 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.

    "text": " For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. Now, how many hundreds do we have? Up to 488, which is in the 400s. So, from 400-488, the 440-449 is included, but 450-488 doesn't include another set of 4 in the tens place. So, total sets are 5 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many full sets do we have? The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, 10. From 300-399: 340-349, 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 as well because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 10 numbers in each hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so from 400-488, which is less than 500. So, how many hundreds are there? Let me think: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 sets. Each of the first four sets (1-399) has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and the last set (400-488) has 10 as well because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 400-488: the tens digit being 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in the last set. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. From 1-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. 100-199:140-149, 10. 200-299:240-249, 10. 300-399:340-349, 10. 400-488:440-449, 10. So that's 5 sets \u00d710=50, correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 4 full sets (each 10) and the last set is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49, correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in each hundred:\n     - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in each hundred:\n     - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8,18,...,488.

From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, the first four blocks are 10 each, and the last one is 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Let me check again. 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me think again. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. The hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. The tens place: 10 numbers per hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5*10=50, correct. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 occurrences, correct. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nNow, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, no: units is 49, tens is 49, so total eights is 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the fours or eights.\n\nWait, when counting fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor units place fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: 484 is the last term. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place fours: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each hundred contributes 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSo, fours total: 49+50+89=188.\n\nEights: units is 49, tens is 49, hundreds 0, so 98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, but maybe I should check if 488 is included. 488 is page 488, so yes, it's included in the hundreds place count.\n\nWait, another way to count fours: for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 appears.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of fours = floor(488/10) +1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1, making 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nNumber of fours = floor(488/100)*10 + min(max(488%100 -40 +1, 0),10). Wait, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nBut I think my initial count is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=8, so add 1, making 49.\n\nFor tens place eights: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40, but then the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, yes, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, is there a faster way to calculate this? Maybe, but I think my step-by-step counting is accurate.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds digit for all numbers from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), except the last set which has 9 numbers (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers per block. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400, 401, ..., 488. That's indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. To find the count, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block might be incomplete. Let's see: The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. Each full block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these has 8, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but I need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Wait, no, because 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 is included. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers.

So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

So, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, and the last block is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, that's actually five blocks because 440-449 is within 488. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-400, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, up to 488, so does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: from 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (1st digit):** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place (2nd digit):** 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,...,440-449.

Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) - 100-199: 180-189 (10) - 200-299: 280-289 (10) - 300-399: 380-389 (10) - 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: - Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. - Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks x 10 = 50. Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49 + 50 +89=188. Now for 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four blocks have 10 each, last block 480-488 is 9. So, 4x10 +9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's=49+49=98.

So, how many hundreds are we considering? From 1-488, the hundreds are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and in the last hundred (400-488), it also appears 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.

How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, let me add again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th? Yes, because 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 8. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, because 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, each hundred except the last contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 1 set \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.

Wait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. To find how many terms, let's see: the first term is 8, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. In each hundred, it's 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 numbers each, so 4\u00d710=40 eights. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, so total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me verify the fours again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. But earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4 sets \u00d710=40 plus 10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 +89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 40, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
