Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me recount the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

Counting eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me think again. Wait, in the tens place for eights, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 49 eights in units, 49 in tens, total 98. And fours are 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours would be less, but no, from 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct. Hmm, maybe that's right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the units place for fours. Let me check that again. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, same calculation: from 8 to 488, which is 49 numbers. So, that's correct. Hmm, maybe 90 is the right answer. Alternatively, perhaps I should check with a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with pages 1-20. How many 4's and 8's? Let's list them:\n\nPage numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.\n\nCounting 4's: 4,14 \u2192 2 fours.\n\nCounting 8's:8,18 \u21922 eights.\n\nSo, 2-2=0. Now, using my method:\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14 \u2192 2.\n\nTens place for 4's: none in 1-20, since 40-49 are beyond 20.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal fours:2.\n\nUnits place for 8's:8,18 \u21922.\n\nTens place for 8's: none, since 80-89 are beyond 20.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal eights:2.\n\nSo, 2-2=0. That works. Now, another example: pages 1-100.\n\nHow many 4's? Units:10 (4,14,...,94). Tens:10 (40-49). Hundreds:0. Total:20.\n\nHow many 8's? Units:10 (8,18,...,98). Tens:10 (80-89). Hundreds:0. Total:20. So, 20-20=0. Hmm, but in 1-100, 4's and 8's are equal. So, my method works here.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the book is 488 pages, so the hundreds digit for fours is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, whereas for eights, the hundreds digit never occurs because 800 is beyond 488. So, that's why fours have more in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, perhaps 90 is correct. Alternatively, maybe I should recount.\n\nWait, another way to count the number of times a digit appears is to calculate for each digit position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48. But wait, that's not quite right. Wait, the formula is actually a bit more precise. For units digit, the count is (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if the remainder is >= digit else 0). Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each digit place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 /10) =48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488 /100) =4, since 488//100=4. Then, the remainder is 88. So, the number of complete tens blocks is 4, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, check if the last partial block has more than 40-49 in tens place. The last partial block is 400-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours:4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. The last partial block is 400-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights:4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: 0, since 488 <800.\n\nSo, total fours:49(units) +50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last set being 480-488 (9 times), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., each set has 10, and there are 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So 5 sets, 10 each, 50. Units place: from 4,14,...484. Let's see, 484 is 48*10 +4, so 48 full tens, but wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 4. So, 49 fours in units place. That seems right. For eights, units place: 8,18,...488. 488 is the 49th occurrence because (488-8)/10=48, so 48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9.

The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets \u00d710=40.

For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, I considered numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But does 400 count as the first page with a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 400 is page 400, which is included. So 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For eights, the tens place: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers as well. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for fours, I considered 4,14,...,484. How many terms is that? Let's calculate: The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Similarly, for eights in the units place, same calculation: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, correct. For the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Eights in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, the last set is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Hundreds place: fours from 400-488: 89 numbers, eights: none. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, maybe I overcounted. Let me check 400-488: 488-400=88, but since both endpoints are included, it's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct.

Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's right. Maybe I should check with a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with pages 1-20. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers: 1-20. 4's: 4,14 (units), and 40-49 but wait, 20 is the limit. So, units: 4 and 14, so 2 fours. Tens: 40-49, but 20 is the limit, so no tens place 4's. Hundreds: none. So, total fours:2. 8's: units:8,18; tens:80-89, but 20 is the limit, so only 8 and 18. So, units:2, tens:0, total eights:2. So, difference is 0. Let me check with my method. Units fours: (20//10)=2 (but 4 and 14). Units eights: (20//10)=2 (8,18). Tens fours: 0 because 20 <40. Tens eights: 0 because 20<80. So, fours:2, eights:2. Difference 0. Correct. Another test: pages 1-100. How many fours and eights? Fours: units:10 (4,14,...94), tens:10 (40-49), hundreds:0. Total fours:20. Eights: units:10 (8,18,...98), tens:10 (80-89), hundreds:0. Total eights:20. So, difference 0. Now, in my problem, the book is 488 pages. So, the hundreds place for fours is 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.

    "text": " Let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: from 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40s,140s,240s,340s,440s). So, 5*10=50 fours in tens. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now for the eights. Units place: from 8,18,...,488. Using the same formula: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189(10), 280-289(10), 380-389(10), 480-488(9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Hundreds place: none, as before. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly for the tens place in the eights? For 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. That seems right. Similarly, for the fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.

Counting the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. But let me double-check the counts for each digit place. For fours in the units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. For fours in the hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems right. I think I did everything correctly. Maybe I can think of another way to count, just to confirm. Alternatively, I can consider each digit position separately and see if the counts make sense. Let me try that. For units digit: in numbers 1-488, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except perhaps the last set. For units digit, the number of times each digit appears is floor(488/10) + (1 if the digit is \u2264 (488 mod 10)). For 4: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod10=8, which is \u22654, so 48+1=49. Similarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and 8 \u22648, so 48+1=49. So, units digits: 49 each. Tens digit: For the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, for the tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, in 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for each digit. But wait, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit in the last partial hundred, digits 0-8 appear 9 times each (since 488 is the 8th ten). Wait, no, actually, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0-8, there are 10 numbers in a full hundred, but in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, and each tens digit from 0-8 appears 9 times (since 488 is the 8th ten, and 488 is included). Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Alternatively, for the tens digit, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 4 full hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4*10=40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 9 times (since 488 is included). So, for each digit in the tens place from 0-8, we have 40 +9=49 times. But wait, that's only for digits 0-8. The digit 9 in the tens place doesn't appear in 401-488 because 490-499 would require pages beyond 488. So, for digits 0-8, they appear 49 times each in the tens place. For digit 9, it appears 40 times (only in the first four hundreds). But in our case, we're counting 4's and 8's. So, for the tens digit, 4 appears 49 times (40 +9), and 8 appears 49 times (40 +9). Wait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. When counting the tens digit, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So, in 1-100: 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). Similarly, in 101-200: 140-149:10 times. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. 401-488: the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. But according to the other method, it's 49. Hmm, so which is correct? Let's see: from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times 10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 50. So, my initial count was correct: 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit 8: from 1-400, it appears 4 times 10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, earlier when I thought it was 49, that was correct. So, total eights in tens place:49. So, in the tens place, fours:50, eights:49. So, when I added up earlier, I had 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.

So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. For eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488.

For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the eights. Let me check the tens place again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4 sets \u00d710=40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place:49, so total eights:98. Fours:188. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the counts can be tricky. Let me try another approach. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again. For the fours: Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is the units digit. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: For the tens digit, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For the eights: Units place:8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last range,480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: no eights. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe the difference would be smaller, but perhaps it's correct. Let me think of another way. Maybe list out the counts for a smaller number to see if the method works. For example, let's say a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. 4's:4,14 \u2192 2 fours. 8's:8,18 \u21922 eights. Difference:0. Wait, but according to my method: Units place: for 4's, 4,14 \u21922. Tens place:40-49, but in 1-20, only 40-49 is beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place:0. So, total fours:2. Units place for 8's:8,18\u21922. Tens place:80-89, beyond 20, so 0. So, total eights:2. Difference:0. Correct. So, my method works for a 20-page book. Let's try another example: a 50-page book. 4's: Units:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925. Tens:40-49\u219210. Hundreds:0. Total fours:5+10=15. 8's: Units:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925. Tens:40-49: no, 80-89 is beyond 50, so 0. So, total eights:5. Difference:15-5=10. Let me count manually: Page numbers 1-50. Fours:4,14,24,34,44,40-49. So, 4,14,24,34,44 (5) plus 10 in 40-49, total 15. Eights:8,18,28,38,48 (5). So, difference is 10. Correct. So, my method seems to work. Therefore, in the 488-page book, the difference is 90 fours more than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

For each digit position, calculate the number of times each digit appears. But I think I did that already. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the number of digits in each position. For units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last few numbers if the total isn't a multiple of 10. Similarly for tens and hundreds places. But I think my initial method was correct. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, total 188 fours. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 eights.
