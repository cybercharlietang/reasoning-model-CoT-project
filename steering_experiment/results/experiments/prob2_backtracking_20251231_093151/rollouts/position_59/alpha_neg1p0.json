Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's. When I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights there. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, the total is 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Number of occurrences: From 4 to 484, there are 49 instances (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100) has 10 such numbers. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - However, the last block (400-488) only goes up to 488, so the tens digit '4' appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks and 10 times in the last block (440-449).\n     - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n     - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Number of occurrences: From 8 to 488, there are 49 instances (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Each hundred block has 10 such numbers. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - However, the last block (400-488) only goes up to 488, so the tens digit '8' appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks and 9 times in the last block (480-488).\n     - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Number of occurrences: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 such numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me confirm that. 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers (including both 480 and 488). So, 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct too. I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90.

The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four sets have 10 each, last set has 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none. So 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for eights. 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the tens place for eights, from 80-89 is 10, same for 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, and then 480-488 is 9 because 489 is beyond 488. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem correct.

There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, no, 1-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set gives 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct.

Counting fours: units place, I had 49, which is correct because from 4,14,...,484: that's (484-4)/10 +1 = 48.4, which we rounded up to 49.

Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Then hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.

So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., but 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 fours. Similarly for each hundred block. So, 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but for the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct.
