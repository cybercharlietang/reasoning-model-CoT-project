So, each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, units:49, tens:49, total eights:98. Fours:188. 188-98=90.

From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Units place for 4: from 4,14,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, how many numbers? (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is in 0-99, 140-149 in 100-199, etc.), so 5*10=50. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but let me think again. When I count the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. But wait, 400 is included, so 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, that's 89 fours. So, yeah, 188 fours total. For 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours there. That's correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours there. So, 5 sets of 10 in the tens place, that's 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 total fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98.
