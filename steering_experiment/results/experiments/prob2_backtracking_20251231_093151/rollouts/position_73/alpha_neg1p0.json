But let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit position more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps using a formula for each digit position. For the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) + (1 if the remainder is >=d else 0). Wait, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, the count can be calculated as follows: For the units place: the number of times 4 appears is (n + 1) /10, rounded down, plus 1 if the units digit is >=4. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. My initial method seems to have given me 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Correct. - Hundreds place: none. So, 49 +49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check the units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50. Correct. For the tens place of 8's: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's:400-488:89 numbers. 8's: none.
