Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is a lot. But maybe that's correct because 488 is a three-digit number, and the hundreds place is 4 for all those pages. So, that would indeed contribute a lot of 4's.

I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This sequence has 49 terms.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which has 9 terms.

    "text": " Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of a different way to calculate it. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately for each position and then sum them up. Wait, I think I did that already. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. Let me try that. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Starting with the units place: For any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by considering higher digits and lower digits. But maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for units place, in each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears once. So, in 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 fours and 48 eights. But wait, in the units place, 488 is the last number, which is 488. So, in the units place, 488 has an 8, so that's an extra 8. So, units place: fours=48, eights=48+1=49. Wait, that's different from before. Wait, no, because in the first 480 numbers, there are 48 fours and 48 eights in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8. So, in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's an extra 8. So, total units place: fours=48, eights=48+1=49. So, that's consistent with my previous count. Similarly, for tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, etc.), and 10 where it's 8 (80-89, etc.). So, in 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many fours and eights in the tens place? The tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place for the last partial hundred, fours=10, eights=9. So, total tens place: fours=40+10=50, eights=40+9=49. That's consistent with my previous count. Now, hundreds place: For hundreds digit, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8 appears in 800-899, but since the book is only up to 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: fours=89, eights=0. Adding up all the digits: For fours: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=48+50=98+89=187. Wait, wait, that's different from before. Earlier I had 188 fours. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me check. Wait, in the units place, I had 49 fours, but in this method, it's 48. So, which is correct? Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of fours in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488. The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. 10(n-1)=480. n-1=48. So, n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, my initial count was correct at 49. But in the alternative method, I thought that in the units place, from 1-480, there are 48 fours, and then 488 adds an 8, but in the units place, 488 is the 48th block, so 48 fours and 48 eights, plus an extra 8 in 488. Wait, no, because 488 is the 489th number? Wait, no, 488 is the last page, which is page 488. So, the units digit of 488 is 8, which is an extra 8 beyond the 48 blocks of 10. So, units place: fours=48, eights=48+1=49. But wait, that would mean 48 fours, but earlier I had 49. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me clarify. The number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 is 48 blocks (since 48*10=480). Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, in this incomplete block, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total fours in units place:48+1=49. That's correct. So, in the alternative method, I should have considered that the incomplete block adds one more 4. So, units place:49 fours. Similarly, eights: in the incomplete block, the units digit 8 appears once (at 488), so eights in units place:48 (from complete blocks) +1=49. So, that's correct. So, in the alternative method, when I was calculating units place, I mistakenly thought that the incomplete block didn't add a 4, but it does, because 484 is within 481-488. So, units place:49 fours, 49 eights. Then, tens place: as calculated earlier, 50 fours and 49 eights. Hundreds place:89 fours, 0 eights. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. I might have confused myself earlier by not properly accounting for the incomplete block in the alternative method, but upon rechecking, it's consistent.

Another way is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, as I did, but maybe I missed something. Let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. Let's set 4 +10(n-1)=484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place, same calculation: 8,18,...,488. 488=8 +10(n-1). So, 10(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. Correct. Now, tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.
