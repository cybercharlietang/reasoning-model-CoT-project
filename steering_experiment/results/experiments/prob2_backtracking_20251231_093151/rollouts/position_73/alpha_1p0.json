Wait, but I just thought of something. In the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 89 numbers from 400-488. But does 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, yes, 400-488 includes 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place in 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, that's 9, not 10. So, that's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 such occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 there. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Another way: Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which contributes 9 because the book ends at 488. So, 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block, 400-488, contributes 9 in the tens place (480-488). So, 40+9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there a chance I double-counted or missed some? Let me check another approach. For the 4's: - Units place: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's floor(488/10)=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more if the remainder is >=4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is less than 4? Wait, no, wait: 488/10=48.8, so the integer part is 48, and the remainder is 8. But wait, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of 4's in units place is floor((488 +1)/10). Wait, maybe a better formula is to calculate it as (n + 9 - d) // 10, where d is the digit we're looking for. So, for units digit 4, n=488, d=4: (488 +9 -4)/10 = (493)/10=49.3, floor is 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Similarly, for tens place: For each position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated. For the tens place being 4: The formula is a bit more involved. The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by considering higher digits and lower digits. The formula is: higher = number formed by digits higher than the current position, current = digit at current position, lower = number formed by digits lower than current position. For example, for the tens place in a three-digit number ABC: higher = A, current = B, lower = C. So, for each occurrence of 4 in the tens place, the count is (higher) * 10^1 + (if current >4, add 10^1, else if current ==4, add (lower +1)). Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of blocks. For the tens place being 4: Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49:10 numbers. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in tens place. Correct. Similarly, for hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: same method, (488 +9 -8)/10= (496)/10=49.6, floor is 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: For each hundred block, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full blocks with 10 each:4*10=40, plus 9 in the last block: total 49. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10 except the last, which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. Total 8's:98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again: in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So that's correct. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
