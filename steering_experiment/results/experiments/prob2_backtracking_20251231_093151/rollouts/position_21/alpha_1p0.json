    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be more than 4. Let me think. For two-digit numbers, 40-49: that's 10 numbers. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 once. So, 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 4's? For each hundred, it's 10, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours. Wait, but 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last three-digit number is 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488. But for the tens place, let's consider each hundred block. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a set of numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 from 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 numbers. Same for 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. Similarly, 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409 and 440-449. Wait, no. Wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 from 400-409 (tens digit 0, so wait, no. Wait, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, so that's not 4. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 when the number is in the range where the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds place. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, because 440-449 is where the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, actually, 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, and the tens digit is 4 there. So, how many numbers is that? From 440-449, that's 10 numbers. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, except the last one, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But in the last hundred block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 hundreds blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, making it 50. Wait, but wait, in the 400-488 block, are there any other tens digits of 4? Let me think. 400-488: the tens digit is 4 only when the number is between 440-449, because 400-439 have tens digits from 0-3, and 440-449 have tens digit 4, and 450-488 have tens digits from 5-8. So yes, only 10 numbers in 400-488 where tens digit is 4. So total tens digit 4's: 4*10 +10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. Let me count each hundred block. - 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens digit 8's: 4 blocks with 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. We analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each hundred block (except the last) contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (400-488) contributes 10.  \n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each hundred block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so up to 488. So, let's see. For two-digit numbers, 40-49: that's 10 numbers. For three-digit numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Plus the two-digit set, that's 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 10 (from 40-49) + 40 (from 140-449 in steps of 100) = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, the number of 8's in the units place is 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's calculate how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. For two-digit numbers: 80-89: 10 numbers. For three-digit numbers: 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, adding these up: 10 (two-digit) + 10 +10 +10 (three-digit sets) +9 (480-488) = 10 + 30 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights.

From 40-49 (two-digit), and then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (all three-digit). That's 1 (two-digit) + 4 (three-digit) = 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

So, how many sets? 1 (two-digit) + 4 (three-digit sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers). So, for the tens place: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be up to 4. So, for the tens place, every time the tens digit is 4, from 0-99, 100-199, etc. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers in each hundred. So, from 0-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but the book ends at 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484, so 49 fours in units place. That seems correct. Tens place: for each hundred, 10 fours, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred; it's 89 numbers. But in the tens place, the 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 eights, and the last hundred (400-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in sequences like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in sequences like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but only 9 times in 480-488.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so up to 488. Let me think. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 440-449, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many times the tens digit is 4. Each time the tens digit is 4, it's for 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. So, in the first hundred (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in the second hundred (101-200), it's 140-149, another 10. Third hundred (201-300): 240-249, 10. Fourth hundred (301-400): 340-349, 10. Now, the fifth hundred would be 401-500, but the book stops at 488. So, in 401-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? Let's see: 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in two places: 440-449 (10) and 480-488 (9). So, total tens digit 4's are 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) + 9 (480-488). Wait, that's 10+10+10+10+10+9 = 60 + 9 = 69? Wait, no, that's 10*5 +9=59. Wait, no, wait. Let me recount. Each hundred before 400 contributes 10. So, 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10) and 480-488 (9). So, 10+9=19. So total tens digit 4's: 40 +19=59. Wait, that seems off. Let me think again. Wait, 1-100: 40-49: 10. 101-200:140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. Then 401-488:440-449:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10*5=50 plus 9=59. So, 59 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the pages from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (59) + hundreds (89) = 49+59=108, 108+89=197. So, 197 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Let me count each hundred: 1-100:80-89:10. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens digit 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, the number of 4's is 197, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 197-98=99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there? From 1-488, so 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 sets. But wait, the last set is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? In each complete hundred (1-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, for 1-399, that's 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), but wait, 0-99 is actually just the first 99 pages, so maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. How many complete hundreds are there before 400? Up to 399, that's 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's 20 fours in the tens place from 400-488. But wait, 488 is less than 499, so 440-449 is fully included, but 480-488 would have tens digit 8, not 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers), so 20 fours. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 (from 1-399) + 20 (from 400-488) = 60 fours. Wait, but let me check: from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. Then 400-488: 400-409 (10) and 440-449 (10), so 20. So total tens place fours: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 20 = 60. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 60 = 109, 109 + 89 = 198. Wait, that can't be right because 4 appears 198 times? That seems high. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me double-check. Units place: 4 appears every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times? The formula is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last digit is 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 has 8 in units, the last 4 is at 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, 48 times? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Let me clarify: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1-480, how many 4's in units place? 480 / 10 = 48. Then, 481-488: the units digits go from 1-8, so no additional 4. So, total units place fours: 48. But earlier, I thought it was 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, correct units place fours: 48. Similarly, tens place: Let's see. From 1-99: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 400-409: 10, 440-449: 10. So that's 10*5 = 50? Wait, no, from 1-399, it's 4 sets of 10, so 40, and then 400-488 adds 20, so total 60. Wait, but if units place is 48, tens 60, hundreds 89, then total 4's would be 48 + 60 + 89 = 197. Hmm, that seems high, but let's see. Now, let's check for 8's. Maybe I should do the same approach. Counting 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-399: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, from 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit 8 never occurs. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 197 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 197 - 98 = 99. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify my counts again. For 4's: units place: 48 times (from 4,14,...,484). Tens place: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) = 40, plus in 400-488, 400-409 (10) and 440-449 (10), total 20, so 60. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 48 + 60 + 89 = 197. For 8's: units place: 49 (8,18,...,488). Tens place: 40 from 1-399, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, difference is 197 - 98 = 99. Wait, but I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4's is 89, but that's correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. Hmm, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1-488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but actually it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. So, units place fours: 49. Tens place fours: as before, 60. Hundreds place fours: 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 60 + 89 = 198. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, difference is 198 - 98 = 100. Wait, now I'm confused because I initially thought units place fours were 48, but actually, since 484 is included, it's 49. So, units place fours: 49, tens:60, hundreds:89, total 198. Units place eights:49, tens:49, total 98. So, difference is 198 - 98 = 100. Wait, but earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. So, which is correct? Let's list them: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. The last 4 in units place is 484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place fours:49. Similarly, units place eights:8,18,...,488. The nth term:8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, units place eights:49. So, that part was correct. So, for 4's: units 49, tens 60, hundreds 89, total 198. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, difference is 198 - 98 = 100. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 99, but now it's 100. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-399, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 40 eights. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights:40 + 9=49. So, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, difference is 198 -98=100. So, the answer should be 100. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. For example, in the number 484, the 4 is in units and hundreds place, but we're counting each digit separately, so it's fine. Similarly, 448 would have two 4's, but each is counted in their respective places. So, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 100 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds place can be up to 4, so 400-488. So, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five sets. But wait, the last set is only up to 488, not 499. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. For the tens digit, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers. So, for each hundred except the last one, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-99: 10 numbers (40-49). From 100-199: 10 numbers (140-149). From 200-299: 10 numbers (240-249). From 300-399: 10 numbers (340-349). From 400-488: 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, in the tens place, 8 appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, let's count. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) plus 9 from 400-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for 4's and 8's. For units place of 4's: from 4,14,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. How many numbers is that? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: from 8 to 488, same calculation: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. For tens place of 4's: as I thought, 5 sets of 10, but wait, earlier I thought it was 5 sets, but actually, let's see: 1-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. For tens place of 8's: 1-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds do we have? From 1 to 488, so 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's four sets. But wait, the last set is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but the tens digit from 400-488 would be 0-8 in the tens place. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-488 as 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, except maybe the last one, we have 10 fours in the tens place. So, 100-199: 10 fours (140-149), 200-299: 10 fours (240-249), 300-399: 10 fours (340-349), 400-488: 10 fours (440-449). So, that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. So, tens place has 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. So, total fours: 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each hundred. 100-199: 180-189, which is 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 occurs 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in the last hundred. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 178 fours minus 88 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. For eights: units 49, tens 39, hundreds 0. 49 + 39 is 88. 178 - 88 is indeed 90. Hmm, but wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours there. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 10 in each of the first three hundreds and 9 in the last. So, 10\u00d73=30, plus 9=39. That seems correct. Units place for both 4 and 8 had 49 each, which is correct because from 1 to 488, the last number with 4 in units is 484, and with 8 is 488, both being the 49th occurrence. So, yes, the difference is 90.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last possible page is 488, so the hundreds place can be up to 4. Let me think. For the tens place, each set of 100 numbers will have a block where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100, 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, 140-149: another 10. Then 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so all those are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let me calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in pages 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights are printed.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488. So, let's see. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n- 140-149: another 10 fours.\n- 240-249: another 10 fours.\n- 340-349: another 10 fours.\n- 440-449: another 10 fours.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 fours. But then, in the 49th set, which is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 occurs once more at 484. So, total units fours are 48 + 1 = 49. So that part was correct. Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there? Let's calculate: The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n- 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 480-488: 9 eights.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 4 in this book, since the book is 488 pages. So, 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, but not 8. So, the hundreds place has zero 8's. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. I counted 400-488 as 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Let me check: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place was 49.

Wait, but when considering the tens place, I think I should consider all numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for the tens place, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1,2,3, and 4. But wait, pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, but when we write page numbers, we don't write leading zeros, so the tens digit for pages 1-99 is just the second digit. So, for the tens digit being 4, in the range 1-99, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, for 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total tens place fours: 10 (40-49) +10 (140-149)+10 (240-249)+10 (340-349)+10 (440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Hmm, wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms, it's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, that's correct. In the tens place, as I thought, 50. In the hundreds place, 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Wait, when I counted the tens place for eights, I considered 80-89, which is 10 numbers, but in the context of the entire page numbers, 80-89 are valid pages. Similarly, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, but in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the number of fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can count the number of fours and eights in each position again. For fours: units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99:40-49, 10 numbers. 100-199:140-149, 10. 200-299:240-249,10. 300-399:340-349,10. 400-488:440-449,10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: same logic, 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights. Tens place: in each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers. So, 0-99:80-89,10. 100-199:180-189,10. 200-299:280-289,10. 300-399:380-389,10. 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 40-49 contributes 10 numbers.\n   - For hundreds 0-3: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n   - For 400-488: 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 80-89 contributes 10 numbers.\n   - For hundreds 0-3: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n   - For 400-488: 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 100-199, it's 140-149, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. For 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? From 100-499, but our book ends at 488, so 400-488 is the last part. Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit being 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's 10. So, total tens place fours are 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, total fours are 178. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's calculate how many terms there are. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, for each hundred, except the last one, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers. So, 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, we have 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. So, 39 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, which is beyond our book's page count. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88. So, total eights are 88. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 178 (fours) - 88 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place was 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. For eights: units 49, tens 39, hundreds 0. 49 + 39 = 88. So, 178 - 88 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for fours again. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 10n - 6. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, yes, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place, same calculation: 488 -8 = 480, 480/10=48, +1=49. So, that's correct. Tens place for fours: 10 per hundred, and 4 hundreds (100-400). Wait, no, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 4 sets, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, 10*4=40, which matches. For eights in tens place: 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+9=39. So, that's correct. Hundreds place: fours have 89, eights have 0. So, total fours 178, eights 88. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, up to 488, so 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds place can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me think. For the tens place, each hundred has a set of numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, but wait, 400-488 is only part of the 400s. Let me clarify. From 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, 10 more. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Now, from 401-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens digits of 4: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me calculate each hundred block: - 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 101-200: 180-189, another 10. - 201-300: 280-289, another 10. - 301-400: 380-389, another 10. - 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total tens digits of 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be up to 4. Let me see. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then in 140-149, another 10, and similarly 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be pages 480 to 489, but the book ends at 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488. Let me count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each set like 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers each. Let's see how many such sets are there. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But for the tens digit to be 8, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389), and 4 (480-488). So, that's 5 sets. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive) because 488 is the last page. So, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 occurs only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the first four sets (hundreds digits 0,1,2,3), each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (hundreds digit 4) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each has 8 in tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, that's another range. So, how many ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place goes up to 4, but the tens place can have 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so let's see:\n\n- 1-99: tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n- 100-199: tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, another 10 times.\n- 200-299: tens digit 4 occurs in 240-249, another 10 times.\n- 300-399: tens digit 4 occurs in 340-349, another 10 times.\n- 400-488: tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, but since 488 is the last page, 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each of the five hundred groups (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, from 1-99, it's 10 times, and from 100-488, it's 4 more hundreds, each contributing 10 times, but wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so perhaps it's better to think of it as 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's five groups. Each group contributes 10 fours in the tens place, except maybe the last group. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, each group contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours would be 5 groups \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so does that count as a separate group? Hmm, perhaps I should think differently. Let me list them:\n\n- Pages 40-49: 10 fours.\n- Pages 140-149: 10 fours.\n- Pages 240-249: 10 fours.\n- Pages 340-349: 10 fours.\n- Pages 440-449: 10 fours.\n\nThat's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me verify with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of fours can be calculated by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFor units place: In every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the 49th occurrence is at 484, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, units place: 49 fours.\n\nFor tens place: In every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, there are 10 fours in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, but in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), how many fours in the tens place? From 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That matches my earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nSimilarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, but the 49th occurrence is at 488. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 8 \u00d7 1 = 8, 8 \u00d7 2 = 16, wait no, that's not the way. Actually, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is 49 times. Because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, another 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, another 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, another 10 eights.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so 9 eights.\n\nWait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, but the last hundred only contributes 9 because the book ends at 488. So, let me confirm:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89: 10 eights.\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 400-488: 480-488: 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nTherefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the units place had 49 eights and the tens place had 49, so total 98. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, 8 appears every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th occurrence at 488. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated, 49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the tens place, it's 49, so total eights would be 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place had 0 eights, so total eights: 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For the tens place, I had 49 eights, as per the calculation. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me go through that again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours (correct, as 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 occurrences).\n- Tens place: 50 fours (as calculated earlier, 10 per hundred for 5 hundreds, including the partial 400-488, which still has 10 fours in the tens place).\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours (since pages 400-488 have 4 as the hundreds digit, which is 89 pages).\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights.\n- Tens place: 49 eights.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 5 sets of 10 fours each, but is that accurate?\n\nWait, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 fours in tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 140-149: 10 fours.\n\nFrom 200-299: 240-249: 10 fours.\n\nFrom 300-399: 340-349: 10 fours.\n\nFrom 400-488: 440-449: 10 fours.\n\nSo, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, from 0-99: 80-89: 10 eights.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189: 10 eights.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289: 10 eights.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389: 10 eights.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488: 9 eights.\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 eights and one set of 9 eights, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the eights in the units place, it's 49, same as fours. But fours have an extra 50 in the tens place and 89 in the hundreds place, which makes the total fours higher.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the eights in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fours is 188, and eights is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct.\n\nSuppose we have a 20-page book. How many fours and eights would there be?\n\nPage numbers: 1-20.\n\nCounting fours:\n\n- Units place: 4, 14: 2 fours.\n- Tens place: 40-49 isn't in 1-20, so 0.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal fours: 2.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 8, 18: 2 eights.\n- Tens place: 80-89 not in 1-20, so 0.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal eights: 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, units fours: 2 (4,14), units eights: 2 (8,18). Tens place: 0 for both. So, same result. So, difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nAnother example: 100 pages.\n\nFours:\n\n- Units: 10 occurrences per 100, so 10 fours.\n- Tens: 10 fours (40-49).\n- Hundreds: 0, since 100 is page 100, which is 1 in hundreds place.\nWait, no, 100 is page 100, so hundreds digit is 1. So, hundreds place fours: 0.\n\nWait, no, in 1-100, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100, but 4 in hundreds place would be 400-499, which isn't in 1-100. So, hundreds place fours: 0.\n\nSo, total fours: 10 (units) + 10 (tens) = 20.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units: 10 eights (8,18,...,98).\n- Tens: 10 eights (80-89).\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal eights: 20.\n\nDifference: 20 - 20 = 0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, it would be 20 fours and 20 eights, so difference 0. That seems correct.\n\nAnother example: 500 pages.\n\nFours:\n\n- Units: 50 fours (since 500 \u00f7 10 = 50).\n- Tens: 50 fours (10 per hundred \u00d7 5 hundreds).\n- Hundreds: 100 fours (400-499).\nTotal fours: 50 + 50 + 100 = 200.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units: 50 eights.\n- Tens: 50 eights.\n- Hundreds: 100 eights (800-899, but wait, 500 pages only go up to 500, so hundreds place eights would be 0, since 800-899 is beyond 500. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\nTotal eights: 50 + 50 = 100.\n\nDifference: 200 - 100 = 100.\n\nWait, but in reality, in 500 pages, the hundreds place for eights would be 0, so eights would be 100, fours would be 200, difference 100. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in our original problem, the book is 488 pages, so the hundreds place for fours is 400-488, which is 89 fours. For eights, hundreds place is 0. So, the method seems consistent.\n\nSo, going back, in 488 pages:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, 10 fours in the tens place in the 400s.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so units fours: 49.\n\nTens place fours: 50.\n\nHundreds place fours: 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits: 49.\n\nTens: 49.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 such groups (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), contributing 10 fours each, totaling 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n   **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last group (400-488), which contributes 9 eights (480-488). Total eights in the tens place: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, how many blocks? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but 400-488: does 440-449 fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's see. The 8 in the units place appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 block, only 9 numbers have 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the units place of 4's: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (1-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens place in 400-488 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place is 49, same as 4's. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's see: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 1-100: 40-49 (10). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). 401-488: 440-449 (10). So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many numbers is that? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count: From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so up to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 count as 10 numbers? Yes, because 440, 441, ..., 449 are all within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's calculate: From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds do we have? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, five sets. But wait, the last set is 400-488, which is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit in 400-488 goes up to 8, so 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 410-419, another 10, and so on up to 480-488. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-99, 10-19, ..., 90-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, 240-249, 10. In 300-399, 340-349, 10. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 10 there are. From 400-409: 10 numbers. 410-419: 10. 420-429: 10. 430-439: 10. 440-449: 10. 450-459: 10. 460-469: 10. 470-479: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 only in the tens place, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 400-488? Let's see: From 400-409: 10 numbers. 410-419: 10. 420-429: 10. 430-439: 10. 440-449: 10. 450-459: 10. 460-469: 10. 470-479: 10. 480-488: 9. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 only when the tens place is 4, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc. But wait, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 400-488? It's 10 (for 400-409) + 10 (410-419) + ... up to 480-488. Let's count how many complete decades there are. From 400-409: 10. 410-419: 10. 420-429: 10. 430-439: 10. 440-449: 10. 450-459: 10. 460-469: 10. 470-479: 10. 480-488: 9. So that's 9 decades, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's in 400-488: 8 decades of 10 (400-409 to 470-479) and 1 decade of 9 (480-488). So, 8*10 + 9 = 89? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each decade is 10 numbers, so from 400-409: 10, 410-419:10, up to 470-479:10, and then 480-488:9. So, how many decades are there? From 400-409 is the first, then each subsequent 10. So, 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. That's 9 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's in 400-488: 8 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 8*10 + 9 = 89. Wait, but that seems too high. Wait, no, because in each set, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409). Similarly, 410-419: 10, etc. So, from 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's 10 times for each full decade, and the last one is 9. So, how many full decades are there? From 400-409: 10. 410-419:10. 420-429:10. 430-439:10. 440-449:10. 450-459:10. 460-469:10. 470-479:10. Then 480-488:9. So, that's 9 sets, but the last is only 9. So, the tens digit 4 appears 8*10 + 9 = 89 times? That seems high. Wait, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these is a 10-number block except the last, which is 9. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's 10 times for each of the first 8 decades (400-409 to 470-479) and 9 times in 480-488. So, 8*10 + 9 = 89. But wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 appears 89 times? That seems impossible because each number only has one digit in the tens place. Wait, no, because each number has a tens digit, so in 89 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears how many times? Wait, no, the range 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers for each decade. Wait, I'm confusing myself. Let me try a different approach. For the tens digit being 4, how many numbers between 1-488 have the tens digit 4? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. But wait, 400-488 includes 400-409, which is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 0, but the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 only in 400-409 when the tens digit is 0. Wait, no, 400-409 is when the hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 0, and units digit varies. So, to have the tens digit as 4, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times in total. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89, which is clearly wrong. So, let me correct that. The tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. So, in the tens place, there are 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, let's sum up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, we can do (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 1-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 49 times. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the fours were 188 and eights 98, so the difference is 90. But let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the tens place, the 4 can appear in the tens digit in the following ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: starting at 8, each step of 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, we can write it as 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, the last range was 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 total. That seems right. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, yes, the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't go beyond 4. So, let's see: for the tens digit, every hundred has a set of numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-99, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. In 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299 has 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399 has 340-349, 10 numbers. Then, 400-488 has 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is within 488. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488. To find how many numbers that is, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=392, which is less than 488. Wait, no, wait, actually, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? It's the same as the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, but since 488 ends with 8, we add 1 more, making it 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. Let me think. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there? From 1-488, the hundreds are 1-4. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. But wait, for the hundreds beyond 100, like 100-199, 200-299, etc., the tens digit 4 occurs in 10 numbers each. So, up to 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. But wait, 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5*10=50. So, the tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 fours. So, total fours would be units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let me check that again because I might have made a mistake. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, how many complete hundreds are there? Up to 399, that's four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40+10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets of 10 are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10, and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting, because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts. For units place fours: from 4 to 484, step 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place fours: each hundred from 0-99,100-199, etc., up to 399, each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each=40. Then, 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50. Correct. Hundreds place fours: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. So, same as fours, 49. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.\n   - 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Additionally, 440-449 contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 numbers.\n   - 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each time, the tens digit is 4, and the units digit can be 0-9. So for each hundred, like 100-199, 200-299, etc., the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. Let me see how many hundreds we have. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, the hundreds are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. For each hundred except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. For the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times as well. So, that's 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10.

So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours.

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, the first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, 488 is the 49th term because 8 is the 1st, 18 the 2nd,...,488 the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see:\n\n- 1-99: 80-89: 10 eights.\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 200-299: 280-289:10 eights.\n- 300-399:380-389:10 eights.\n- 400-488:480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so how many? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 hundreds (1-399) contributing 10 each, and 400-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\n- 1-99:80-89:10 eights.\n- 100-199:180-189:10.\n- 200-299:280-289:10.\n- 300-399:380-389:10.\n- 400-488:480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page).\nSo, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place in the 400-488 range. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, yes, the tens place eights are 49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place in 400-488 contributed 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights:98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about units place, I had 49 eights, and tens place 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units place had 49 fours, tens 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188.\n\nWait, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for fours. I thought it was 50. Let me recount.\n\nFor the tens place, fours appear in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That's correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place:8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for eights: as above, 49.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can go up to 4. Let me think. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another, that's another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many sets is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, but for 480-488, it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's calculate: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n   \n   **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with 480-488 contributing 9 times, totaling 49 times.\n   \n   **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 488 is the last page. So, 400-488. Let me see. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. How many hundreds do we have? From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, actually, up to 488, so 400-488 is the last partial hundred. So, in each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, that's 4 times 10 = 40 fours. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 400-409. But wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 400 is included in the hundreds place, so does that affect anything? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 0 in 400, so 400 has a 4 in the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 0. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 only for 404-409? Wait, no, no. Wait, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, right? Because 400 is 4 0 0, 401 is 4 0 1, up to 409 is 4 0 9. So, the tens digit is 0 in that range. So, where does the tens digit become 4 again? It's in 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit fours: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last range. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me think again. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, in 1-100: 80-89: 10. 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289: 10. 301-400: 380-389: 10. Then, 401-488: 480-488: 9. So, total tens digit eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. How many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, we have 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but let me check. Wait, no, 0-99 is the first, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 is the third, 300-399 is the fourth, and 400-488 is the fifth. So, in each of these, except maybe the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers (since 449 is less than 488)\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 after 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 \u2192 9 numbers)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (each hundred) and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counting for fours and eights to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: In each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: In each hundred except the last, 80-89, 180-189, etc., 4 sets of 10, so 40. Plus in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the hundreds place for fours, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, which is correct. But for eights, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book ends at 488. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit position, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table for each digit position.\n\nBut I think my previous calculations are correct.

For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, for hundreds 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, how many complete hundreds do we have? The book has up to 488, so the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) up to 4 (for 400-488). Wait, actually, 1-99 are two-digit numbers, but their hundreds digit is 0. So, let's consider each hundred block:\n\n- Hundreds digit 0 (pages 1-99): The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. But wait, pages 1-99: the tens digit is 4 from 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours in the tens place here.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199): The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is another 10 numbers. So, another 10 fours.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (pages 200-299): Similarly, 240-249 gives 10 fours.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (pages 300-399): 340-349 gives 10 fours.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488): Now, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, does 449 fall within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's 10 fours.\n\nSo, in each hundred block, we have 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundred blocks are there? From 0 to 4, that's 5 hundred blocks. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, the last hundred block is 400-488, which is not a complete hundred. But in the tens place, 440-449 is still within 400-488, so it's a full 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each hundred block:\n\n- Hundreds digit 0 (pages 1-99): The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1 (pages 100-199): 180-189, another 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2 (pages 200-299): 280-289, another 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3 (pages 300-399): 380-389, another 10 eights.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488): The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds block 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Yep, that looks correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** In each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), giving 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** In each hundred block, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for blocks 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. For the 400-488 block, it appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each time 4 is in the tens place, it appears for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place). How many such sets are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, there's one set (40-49), in 101-200, another set (140-149), and so on. Let's see how many hundreds we have. 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last set in the tens place would be 440-449, right? Because 450-488 wouldn't have a complete set of 10 for the tens digit 4. So, how many sets do we have? From 1-400, there are four sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Then, from 401-488, the next set would be 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's five sets in total, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's valid. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, it's included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets are there in 1-488. Each set is 10 numbers. From 1-400, how many sets? 40-49, 140-149, etc., but for 8, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, that's four sets, each contributing 10 eights. Now, from 401-488, does 480-489 fall within? 480-489 is within 488, so that's another set (480-489), which is 10 numbers. So, total sets: 5. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (0) = 99. So, 99 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 99 eights = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 50 = 99.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 99 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-99, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Similarly, from 100-199, another 10, 200-299 another 10, 300-399 another 10, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488: the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but since we're only going up to 488, let's see. Wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (another 10), 420-429 (another 10), 430-439 (another 10), 440-449 (another 10), and 450-459 (another 10), 460-469 (another 10), 470-479 (another 10), and then 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, and 470-479. That's 8 sets of 10, which is 80 numbers. But wait, let me think again. From 400-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's when the tens digit is 4, so 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 470-479. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 8 such sets (since 400-479 is 80 numbers). So, that's 80 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that doesn't add any more 4's in the tens place. So, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 80 numbers. Now, for the other hundreds: 1-99: 10 numbers with tens digit 4 (40-49). 100-199: another 10 (140-149). 200-299: another 10 (240-249). 300-399: another 10 (340-349). So, that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 numbers. Then, from 400-488: 80 numbers as above. So, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 80 = 120. Wait, but let me check: 1-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:80. So, 10+10+10+10+80=120. So, 120 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (120) + hundreds (89) = 49+120=169+89=258. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but we have an extra 4 at 484, so 49. Correct. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 8 sets of 10, which is 80. So, 40+80=120. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49+120+89=258. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 2, but wait, 488 is 48*10 +8, so 488 is the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. For each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers. So, from 1-99: 10 numbers. 100-199: another 10. 200-299: another 10. 300-399: another 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Because in the tens place, 400-488 has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9, plus 4*10=40, so 49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Wait, no: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 258, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 258-98=160. Wait, that seems a lot. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours. Let's recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in units place. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, plus one more (484). So, 49. Correct. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in tens place. So, 1-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488: how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10). That's 8 sets of 10, which is 80. So, 400-488 contributes 80. So, total tens place fours: 4*10=40 +80=120. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49+120+89=258. Now, eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights:98. So, 258-98=160. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 8 sets of 10, which is 80. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 80 numbers with tens digit 4, and 9 numbers with tens digit 8 (480-488). That adds up to 89, which is correct. So, yes, 80 fours in tens place from 400-488, plus 40 from the other hundreds, so 120. So, total fours:258. Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 258-98=160. So, the answer should be 160 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can go up to 4, but the tens place in 400-488 can have 4's. Let me think. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers (40-49). From 100-199, again 10 numbers (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 10 numbers (240-249). 300-399: 10 numbers (340-349). Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 40-48, which is 9 numbers (40-48), but wait, actually, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, which is 10 numbers. Wait, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, so that's not correct. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 sets of 10 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) plus 10 from 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is in the 400-499 range, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no. Wait, from 1-399, how many tens digits are 4? Each hundred block (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has one set of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I overcounted in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's every number from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, 188 total fours. For 8's, in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block (except the last) contributes 10 numbers, and 440-449 contributes another 10.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 (from first four blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be up to 488. So, let's see. Each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect anything? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, how many sets do we have? Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 0-399, that's four hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, another 10. So total tens place fours would be 40+10=50. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, but 8's. The first occurrence is 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, 48*10=480, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no. Wait, 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can go up to 4. Let me see. For two-digit numbers, from 40 to 49: that's 10 numbers. For three-digit numbers, in the 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours. Hmm, that seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, for each hundred block: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place:0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my calculations again to be sure. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: from 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me think. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. For example, in 0-99, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 per hundred, but the last hundred only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's still 10. So, total tens place fours: 10 (for 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but the book stops at 488, so does that affect the count? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so yes, it's 10 numbers. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, same as 4's? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 8, but only up to 488. So, let's break it down: - 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's 49? Let me add: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Yes. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, the hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-99, there are 10 fours in the tens place. From 100-199, another 10, 200-299, another 10, 300-399, another 10, and 400-488, how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 - 280-289: 10 - 380-389: 10 - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (with the last block ending at 488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488. So, let me think. For two-digit numbers, 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, and 4, the tens digit is 4. So, for hundreds digit 1: 140-149 (10 numbers), hundreds digit 2: 240-249 (10 numbers), hundreds digit 3: 340-349 (10 numbers), and hundreds digit 4: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. So, total fours in the tens place: 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. So, total fours: 178. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me count each range. For two-digit numbers: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. For three-digit numbers: hundreds digit 1: 180-189 (10 numbers), hundreds digit 2: 280-289 (10 numbers), hundreds digit 3: 380-389 (10 numbers), hundreds digit 4: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for hundreds digit 4, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (for 80-89) + 10 + 10 + 10 (for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) + 9 (for 480-488) = 10 + 30 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80. So, there are 80 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, how many fours in the tens place? The numbers 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, but 440-449 is within 488. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, that's another 10. So total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, from 1-400, it's 4 sets, each with 10, so 40. Then 401-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 more. So total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each set. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.
