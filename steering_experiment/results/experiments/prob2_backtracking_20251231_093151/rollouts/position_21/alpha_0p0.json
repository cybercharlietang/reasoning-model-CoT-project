    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Since the book has 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400's. Let me think again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. From 1-488, how many full hundreds do we have? 400 is the next after 399, so 400-488 is part of the 400's. So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets of 10, so 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? 480-489 is within 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's an extra 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, because 480-489 is part of the 400's, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I said 50 fours in the tens place, which comes from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the 8's, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: same as 4's, 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) 100-199: 140-149 (10) 200-299: 240-249 (10) 300-399: 340-349 (10) 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last occurrence is at 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 numbers, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks we have in 1-488. 1-99: 80-89 (10) 100-199: 180-189 (10) 200-299: 280-289 (10) 300-399: 380-389 (10) 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block contributes 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of 4's: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks.  \n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.  \n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.  \n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many full ranges there are. The last page is 488, so the last range with a 4 in the tens place is 440-449. How many ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.

So, 4 ranges, 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does it count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89 (first 100), 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers (since 8 is the first one, and 488 is the 49th). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, we only have up to 488. So, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, plus the 480-488 range contributing 9. So, that's 4x10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 40. Then 480-488:9. So total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let me check: 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. So, that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Wait, does 480-489 have a tens digit of 8? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, total in the tens place is 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 are all within 488, so each has 10 numbers. Then, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) and one partial range (9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go back to counting the 4's. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula for the number of terms is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188. That seems correct. Now for the eights: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full ranges (10 each) and one partial (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 ranges.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full range contributes 10 eights, and the partial range 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: (4 * 10) + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, let me count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the 49th number because 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number because 488/10 = 48.8, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none. Total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, we have 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, in each hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds do we have? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 is one set. 100-199: 140-149. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So, that's five sets. Wait, 1-99: 40-49 is one set. Then each subsequent hundred adds another set. So, 1-99: 1 set, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. So, total 5 sets. Each set has 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if these are within 488. 80-89 is okay, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, 480-489 is up to 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 1-99: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial set with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds place is 4 only for numbers 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many blocks do we have? From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 484 is included, that's 49 fours. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10, and the last has 9, so 4x10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Starting from 40-49 (which is 4*10 + 0 to 4*10 +9), then 140-149 is 14*10, etc. Wait, actually, it's better to think in terms of how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So total in the tens place: 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +50 +89.

It's every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488/10) =48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

From 400 to 488 inclusive. Let's calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, we take the integer part as 48, but let's check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8. So, from 8 to 488, how many? The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (488-8)=480, 480/10=48, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, so 48 eights. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*50=400, but 488 is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so 49th. Wait, let me think again. From 0 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10. 280-289: yes, 10. 380-389: yes, 10. 480-489: but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place for 8 in 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488. So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, so the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Each range from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, let me correct that. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, how many of these have a 4 in the hundreds place? All of them, because 400-488 are all three-digit numbers starting with 4. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488: the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 8 if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. In the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, from 0-399, the tens digit 8 occurs 4 times 10, which is 40, and from 400-488, it's 9. So, 40+9=49. So, that seems correct. Similarly, for fours, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting units and tens, we might overlap or miss some. For example, in the units place for fours, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 times. That seems right. Similarly, for eights, same logic: 488/10=48.8, so 49 times in units place. For tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 400-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so total 50. So that's correct. For eights in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 4 blocks of 10, so 40, and then from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 49. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the number 444, the digit 4 appears three times. But in my counting, I counted each occurrence separately in units, tens, and hundreds. So, that's correct. Similarly, 488 has two 8's, but in my counting, I counted each occurrence in units and tens. So, that's correct. So, I think my count is accurate.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-400, this occurs 40 times, and from 400-488, it's 9 more times (480-488), totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book has only 488 pages.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, which gives 48 eights.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488.

So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many such groups there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. Now, does 480-489 exist? Well, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's count how many such numbers. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on. The last is 488. To find how many numbers, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would have an 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers, not 10. Therefore, for the tens place, it's 4 blocks of 10, which would be 40, but since the last block (480-489) only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place? Wait, no. Let me correct this. The first three blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. The next block is 380-389, which is another 10, making it 40. But then, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, have 8 in the tens place. So, the total in the tens place is 40 (from the first four blocks) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, no, because the first four blocks would be 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), and 380-389 (10), totaling 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 more, so total eights in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does the 400-488 range include 440-449? Yes, and that's 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds another 8. So, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, for the hundreds place, the 400-488 range only has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, tens place: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total 49 in tens place, plus 49 in units place, total 98 eights. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my counts again. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But 400-488 is 89 numbers, but 440-449 is only 10 of those. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488), resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no occurrences of '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. The ranges are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, because 488 is the last). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that?

So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.

Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes. And for the tens place of 8's, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.

Wait, but 400-488 is not a full block. So, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which rounds down to 48, but since 488 includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence, yes, 49 units. Tens place: as calculated, 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full occurrences, but 488 is included, so that's 49. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have in 488 pages. 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens places with 8: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, let's see: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total tens digits with 8: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I overcounted the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full sets, which is 48*1=48, but since 488 is included, which is 484 (units 4), so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 units. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, the book only has 488 pages. Let me check if 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct.

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens places with 4: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, plus one more at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488. Let's count each: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens places with 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, there are 10 fours in the tens place (40-49). Similarly, from 101-200, 140-149 gives another 10 fours. Continuing this, from 201-300, 240-249 gives 10 fours, and from 301-400, 340-349 gives another 10. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Let me add up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so that's correct. So, total fours are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. From 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189 is another 10. From 201-300: 280-289 is another 10. From 301-400: 380-389 is another 10. Now, from 401-488, the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place had 49 eights, so total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Let me check again: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't overcount. For fours: units place is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1 to 488, the blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So total tens place fours would be 40 (from the first four blocks) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So units place is 49. Tens place: In each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributes 10. There are 4 full hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total tens place is 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89= 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but let's check. The first occurrence is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks with 10 each (1-399) and the last block (400-488) with 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete blocks of 100 we have in 488 pages. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, not a full 100. So, for each complete hundred, there are 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but our book only goes up to 488, so it's 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, let's calculate. Each hundred block (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 1-100: 80-89 (10). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 0-99, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, it's 240-249, 10 again. In 300-399, it's 340-349, 10. In 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: 1, 200-299: 1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Let me confirm: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many such blocks. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299:280-289,10. 300-399:380-389,10. 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, the number of eights in the tens place is: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189,280-289,380-389) and 1 block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98. So, total eights printed:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each range. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place contributions: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4x10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.

So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so from 0 to 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is within our range. 480-489 is up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each of the first four ranges gives 10 eights, and the last range gives 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I thought maybe the hundreds place for eights would be zero, which it is. So, maybe the answer is 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 400-488, the tens place 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, as I did. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but actually, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: Let me check how many. From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place in 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, adding up: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check the tens place for 480-488. The tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 eights there. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 numbers (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 numbers (from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights.**\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours.**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so units digit is 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90.

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

That's 5 ranges, but the last one only goes up to 488 instead of 489. Each full range has 10 numbers, so 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4\u00d710=40 eights. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.
