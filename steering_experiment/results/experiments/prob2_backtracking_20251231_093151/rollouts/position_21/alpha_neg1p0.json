    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, we have four complete decades: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. The next range would be 440-449, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, we have four complete decades: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next range would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the end). Wait, no. Wait, the tens place being 8 means the numbers are 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the number of eights is 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the number of eights in the hundreds place is 0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, for the fours: units place was 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the tens place for fours again. The tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems right. The hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. Since 484 is the last page, and 484 is 48*10 +4, so 49 numbers. So, units place is correct. For eights: units place is 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, total eights are 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another block. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place will have 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is 488, so let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, that's 488 numbers. The number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is exactly 48\u00d710 + 8, we add 1 more, making it 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me calculate how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. How many blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights = 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98.

The next is 140-149, another 10, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have a 4 starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is in the units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have an 8 only in the block 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89 eights. Now, the difference between the number of fours and eights is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: Units place: 49, correct because 484 is the last one, so 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. For eights: Units place: 488 is included, so 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 eights. Tens place: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10, so 40 eights. Hundreds place: none. So, 49 + 40 = 89 eights. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, but wait, when counting the units place for fours, I considered up to 484, which is correct because 484 is the last page. For eights, the last occurrence in units is 488, which is correct. So, yes, 49 eights in units place. So, the difference is indeed 99. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. Pages 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Eights: 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digits, we might miss some edge cases. Let me think again. For units place fours: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Similarly, for units place eights: 8,18,...,488. Same calculation: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 x 10 = 50. Correct. Tens place eights: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, so 4 x 10 = 40. Correct. Hundreds place fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place eights: none. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total eights: 49 + 40 = 89. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. So, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 99 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one range, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term can be represented as 10n - 2. Let's solve for when 10n - 2 = 488: 10n = 490, so n = 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, the last range is 480-488. How many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 10 eights as well because 480-489 would have 10, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, for the tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each with 10 eights, so 4*10=40, plus the 480-488 range, which has 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So, 4 ranges *10 + 9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (from 400 to 488).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each (4 \u00d7 10 = 40).\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = **49 eights**.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in a 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights**\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another range, another 10 fours. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349, 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 would be 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 449 is within that range. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, let me check again. 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89, 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 eights. Now, from 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no. Wait, from 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, each 10, so 40. Then, 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought the hundreds place would have none, but let me check again. Wait, 400-488: the hundreds digit is 4, so no 8's there. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I counted fours, I had 188, and eights as 98, so 90 more fours than eights. But let me double-check my counting because that seems a bit high.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. Let me go back. The hundreds place for fours is from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Then, tens place: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Units place: 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98 eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember that in some similar problems, the difference isn't that large. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For fours: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? It's the same as how many complete groups of 10 are there. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th group, from 480-488, the 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights: same logic, 488 /10=48.8, so 49 eights in units place.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- For fours: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, except the last block (400-488). Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 fours in tens place.\n\nFor eights: similar. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- Fours: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\n- Eights: no numbers in 800-899, so 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so that's 90 more fours than eights. But I'm a bit unsure because I thought the difference would be smaller. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, there's one 4. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th ten, 484 is the last one. So, 49 fours.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many hundreds are there? From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10 (440-449). So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Same as 4's, 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, 10 eights in the tens place. From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10. Then, 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me check for any possible miscalculations, especially in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the number of 8's. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers have a block where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (400-488), which contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 blocks are valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in the numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait a second, is that correct? Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 488 itself adds another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 8 to 488, it's every 10 numbers, so 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each of these has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. Wait, but does 480-489 count as a full block? Since we only go up to 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, the tens place in the hundreds block (400-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights there. So, 40 from the earlier blocks plus 9 is 49. That's correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, fours total 188, eights 98. So, difference is 90. Wait, but I just realized something. When counting the units place for fours, I went up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. But wait, 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place before 488. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights, units place goes up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 488 go beyond 449? Yes, but the tens place is only about the second digit, so 440-449 is the last block where the tens digit is 4. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, I need to do the same for 8's.

Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place except the last one, which contributes 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Let me check: From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40 and 1 x 9 = 9, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5 x10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. Same as above: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 4 full blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So, 4x10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Let me also check the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9). So, 4x10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights in total. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each full block contributes 10, with the last block contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book doesn't reach 800.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 fours. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place will have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 eights each, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's.

The last page is 488, so the tens place can go up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since 489 is beyond 488, we only have 480-488. So, how many complete ranges do we have? 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Now, does 480-488 add any more fours in the tens place? Yes, because 480-488 has 480-489, which is a full range, but we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, but we're looking at the tens place. Wait, in the tens place, 480-488 has 4 in the tens place as well. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, not 4. Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, not 4. Wait, no, 480 has 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 0 in the units. So, actually, 480-488 doesn't add any fours in the tens place. So, the tens place fours are only from the five ranges: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, units place:49, tens place:50. Now, hundreds place: 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me think: 400-499 would be 100 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488: from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The difference between 488 and 8 is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each range. 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

To find how many, we can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's check each block: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488.

So, for the tens place, we have four blocks with 10 eights each and one block with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights.

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Let me verify: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) \u2192 10 eights in tens place. - 180-189: 10 \u2192 10. - 280-289: 10 \u2192 10. - 380-389: 10 \u2192 10. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place.

So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99.

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Now, check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all five blocks are complete. So, tens place has 50 fours. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

That's 4 blocks, each with 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Now, check if 380-389 is within 488. Yes, 389 is less than 488, so all four blocks are complete. So, tens place has 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99.

So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. From 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. So that's 4 ranges, each with 10 eights, totaling 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book goes only up to 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (480-488). So, I think I missed that. So, the ranges are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Wait, the last range is 400-488, which is only up to 488, not 499. So, in the hundreds place, we have 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 only from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488).

Wait, no, actually, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit being 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Each of these is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 400-409:10, 410-419:10, 420-429:10, 430-439:10, 440-449:10, 450-459:10, 460-469:10, 470-479:10, 480-488:9. Wait, but that's too many. Wait, no, each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 4. So, for each hundred, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10, and so on. So, from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: let's see, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? In 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, but that's 9 ranges, each with 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 8 ranges of 10 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and one range of 9 (480-488). So that's 8*10 +9=89 numbers? Wait, no, that's not correct because each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, but in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, which is 8 ranges (since 400-479 is 8 hundreds), each with 10 numbers, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 8*10 +9=89 numbers. But wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Wait, no, the tens digit being 4 in 400-488 occurs in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), ..., 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 8 times 10 (for 400-479) plus 9, which is 89. But wait, 400-479 is 80 numbers, and 480-488 is 9, so total 89. But wait, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so in 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: let's see, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), ..., 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 8 times 10 plus 9, which is 89. So, total tens digit 4's: 10 (from 0-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+89 (400-488)= 10+10+10+10+89=129. Wait, but that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate the number of times the tens digit is 4 in each hundred. For each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each complete hundred, that's 10 numbers. Now, how many complete hundreds are there? Up to 400-499, but the book ends at 488. So, the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) are complete, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, and 480-488. So, from 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let's see, 400-409:10, 410-419:10, ..., up to 470-479:10, which is 8 ranges (since 400 to 479 is 80 numbers, divided into 10s), so 8*10=80. Then, 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in 400-488:80+9=89. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 hundreds *10 +89=40+89=129. Hmm, that seems correct. So, units digit 4's:49, tens digit 4's:129. Now, what about the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, hundreds digit 4's:89. So, total number of 4's:49 (units) +129 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=49+129=178+89=267. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units digit:4,14,24,...,484. So, from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens digit: as above, 129. Hundreds digit: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, total 4's:49+129+89=267. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many complete ranges? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens digit 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds digit 8's:0. Therefore, total number of 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's:267-98=169. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=129, hundreds=89. Total=49+129=178+89=267. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=267-98=169. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount. Let me recount the tens digit for 4's. Tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and in 400-488, which includes 400-409, 410-419,...,470-479 (each 10 numbers), and 480-488 (9). So, from 400-488, that's 8 ranges of 10 (400-409 to 470-479) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 8*10=80 and 9, total 89. So, 4 hundreds blocks (each contributing 10) plus 89=40+89=129. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's, tens digit: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40+9=49. That's correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 267-98=169. Therefore, there are 169 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 470-479, and 480-488.\n   - Each complete hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and the last partial hundred contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 89 in 400-488 \u2192 40 + 89 = 129.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 129 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **267**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each complete hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and the last partial hundred contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 \u2192 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n267 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **169**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{169}."

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let me calculate 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in the units place? Each block of 10 has one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 block of 9 (from 400-488). So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no. Wait, let me correct that. The first four blocks (0-399) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last block (400-488) contributes 9 eights (480-488). So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. In the tens place, for each hundred block, like 0-99, 100-199, etc., each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 0-399, that's four blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for units place, from 8,18,...,488, that's 49 numbers because 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total eights:98. Fours:188. So, difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89  \n   - Total occurrences: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488).  \n   - Number of full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The numbers go from 8 to 488, which is 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would only include up to 488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one which might be less. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, that's correct, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. The total number of numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add another. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term 4, common difference 10, and last term 484.\n   - Number of terms = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9).\n   - Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Total = 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many complete ranges there are. The last page is 488, so the hundreds digit can be up to 4. So, for the hundreds place, 400-488 is included, but 440-449 is within that. So, how many ranges? From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let's do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is included, so how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one range, then each subsequent hundred adds another range. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. However, wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, and 450-459 would have 450-459, but 450-459 is within 488, so actually, the tens place 4's go up to 449, which is correct. So, 5 ranges, 10 numbers each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, and then the last number is 488, which is an extra. So, 48*10 gives 480, but wait, that's not the right way. Let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. Since 488 is the last page, the units digit 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We need the nth term <= 488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 <= 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10 <= 480. Divide by 10: n-1 <= 48. So, n <= 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) \u2192 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 numbers \u2192 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 numbers \u2192 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 numbers \u2192 10 eights. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens: 49, so total 98 eights. Earlier, I had 188 fours. So, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: From 4 to 484 with a common difference of 10.\n   - Calculation: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: From 8 to 488 with a common difference of 10.\n   - Calculation: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Partial range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49** times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many hundreds we have. The book goes up to 488, so we have hundreds as 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's five hundreds. In each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Now, the last hundred is 400-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, we get 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 50. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges we have. The hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for the first four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, the last hundred is 400-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding that, we get 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers, except the last hundred (400-488), which contributes 10 (440-449).\n   - Total: 5 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10, and the last hundred contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have a 4 in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that would suggest 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, the blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, how many eights in the tens place? 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. The 480-488 block has 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9. So, total in tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only be 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours to find how many more fours there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place was 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, totaling 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait a second. Let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights, the tens place had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. That's correct. Units place for both was 49, which seems right because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 or 8 in the units place, so 48 full decades (1-480) plus 8 numbers (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so in the units place, the last 488 has 8 in units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place? Let me think again. For units place, the number of times 4 appears is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is beyond the next multiple. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(48.8)=48, but since 488 is included, the number of 4's in units place is 49. Similarly for 8's, it's also 49. That seems correct. Now, checking the hundreds place for fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. For eights, hundreds place is zero because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, that's correct. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, but wait another thing. Let me check the tens place for eights again. The 480-488 block: how many tens digits are 8? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, that's correct. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) give 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are right.

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Now, I should check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, for the tens place, the first four blocks contribute 4\u00d710=40 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, and 400-488: another. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. But wait, in the last block, 400-488, does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 400-488? 480-489 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last number is 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits with 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but again, we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 0-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 eights because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me double-check that. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. That's 4\u00d710=40. Then 480-488: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, we have 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many full ranges do we have? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, the last partial range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 +0=98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90.

Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, this block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours.  \n   - The last set ends at 484, adding 1 more four.  \n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place.  \n   - From 1-488, there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - There are 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).  \n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 eights.  \n   - The last set ends at 488, adding 1 more eight.  \n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block.  \n   - From 1-488, there are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights.  \n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.  \n   - **Total in tens place:** (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. So, how many blocks? Let me count: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. Each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many tens? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence, we have 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's see how many blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, how many eights in the tens place? Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributes 10 eights. But the last block, 480-488, only contributes 9 eights because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's calculate: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within that, so yes, 50 fours. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check again because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, which is correct. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would only go up to 488. Let's see how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges of 10, and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so total 49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 188 fours, and eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the fours in the units place. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last one is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 times because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place fours: 49.\n\nTens place fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many such ranges? 40-49: yes, 140-149: yes, 240-249: yes, 340-349: yes, and 440-449: yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488/10=48.8, so 49 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last one (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, as before.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which equals 90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 -400 +1=89, correct.\n\nFor eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place for fours, I have 49, which includes 484 as the last one. For eights, units place also has 49, including 488.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for fours, 440-449 is 10 numbers, correct, because 440-449 is within 488.\n\nSo, fours: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nEights:49 +49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting ranges, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a three-digit number, each position (units, tens, hundreds) can be considered separately.\n\nLet's calculate for each digit place:\n\n**Units place:**\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10)=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then in the 48th decade, 480-488, how many 4's in the units place? The units digit cycles 0-9, so in 480-488, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears once in the units place in this partial decade (484). So total units place 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of times 8 appears: same logic. Each full decade contributes one 8 in the units place, and in the partial decade 480-488, 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears: Similarly, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: In the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears: In the hundreds place, 8 would appear from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the answer was 90, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have miscounted. Let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nFor eights, since the book ends at 488, there's no 800-899, so no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for fours. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the units place, it's 8,18,28,...,488, which is also 49 numbers.\n\nSo, units place is correct.\n\nTens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50.\n\nTens place for eights:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four are 10 each, and the last one is 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place fours:89, eights:0.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, so I think the correct answer is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480; n-1=48; n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers, so 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the range is 480-488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges gives 10 eights, but the last one (480-488) gives 9 eights because 489 is beyond 488. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total eights =49+49=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, that's 90. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10 numbers), 240-249 (10 numbers), 340-349 (10 numbers), and 440-449 (10 numbers). Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait a minute. 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, no, 99 + 89 is actually 188, yes. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th number in the units place where the digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many full blocks of 100 we have. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. And then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 numbers.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks each contributing 10 fours, which is 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which would mean 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48, but then from 480 to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So total units fours would be 48 +1=49, which matches my earlier count. Tens place: Each hundred block has a decade where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50, which seems correct. Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the last partial decade, 480-488, 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place. So total units eights: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes, and 480-488: which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So, for the tens place, each full block contributes 10 eights, but the last block only contributes 10 if it's complete. Wait, 480-489 would be a full block, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, the 480-488 block contributes 9 eights. So total tens eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. When I counted fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. And for eights, in the tens place, I had four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits was 49 each, so that's consistent. Hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Then 140-149: another, and so on up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within the range. So, yes, 440-449 is valid, contributing 10 fours. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. Let me see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me think again. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let me count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's see. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? Let's divide 488 by 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. So, there are 48 full decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me calculate how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus the 480-488 range, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours than eights. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0.

Then, 140-149, another 10, and so on. The last block would be 440-449, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let's count the number of blocks. From 40-49: 1 block, 140-149: 2nd block, 240-249: 3rd, 340-349: 4th, and 440-449: 5th block. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is included, so actually, it's 49 occurrences because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,38,48,58,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Now, does 480-489 exist? Well, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. But in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, the tens place for 480-488 is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, the blocks are 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74 +9=40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place has 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that's 49 +49=98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, another. 240-249, another. 340-349, another. And 440-449, which is the fifth range. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last range is 440-449, and our book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 488, so all those numbers are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 in the units place appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but again, I need to check if 488 is included. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8 (which is 8 + 0*10), the last term is 488 (which is 8 + 48*10). So, the number of terms is 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let me count how many such ranges. 80-89: yes, that's one. 180-189: another. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. 480-488: fifth range. So, five ranges. For the first four ranges, each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. But the last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last range, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. To find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But for the tens place, 4 can appear in each hundred block. So, 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, 49+50=99? Wait, 49+50 is 99, yes. Then 99+89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many such ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.
