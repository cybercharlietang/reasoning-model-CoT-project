    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, I need to check if the last partial group (481-488) has a 4 in the units place. The last number with a 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, 484 is included, meaning the units place has 48 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the 40-49 range, which is one set, then 140-149, which is another, and so on up to 440-449. So, how many sets is that? Let's see: 40-49 is one, 140-149 is two, 240-249 is three, 340-349 is four, and 440-449 is five. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. The last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no. Wait, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 489th number, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included in the 480-489 group, which is the 49th group. Wait, no, because 1-10 is group 1, 11-20 is group 2, etc. So, 480-489 would be group 49. But since the book only goes up to 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers in that group. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in each group, so 48 groups \u00d7 1 = 48, plus in the 480-488 group, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Let's count how many such ranges are within 1-488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, this range is only up to 488. So, how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. Each of these contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial range, so 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no. Wait, 80-89 is one range, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. So, that's five ranges. The first four are complete, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The fifth range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. That would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Adding up the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. The last group (480-488) includes 484, adding 1 more, totaling 48.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 occurrences. The last group (480-488) includes 488, adding 1 more, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 such ranges, with the last being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete group, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Plus, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is in there, which adds one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. In each such block, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Plus, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but let me check. Let's count each block: - 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 101-200: 180-189, 10 numbers. - 201-300: 280-289, 10 numbers. - 301-400: 380-389, 10 numbers. - 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in each of the first four blocks, there are 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last block, 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and an additional 4 in 484. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each 100-number block has 10 such numbers, and there are 4 complete blocks plus 10 in 440-449. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, and an additional 8 in 488. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each 100-number block has 10 such numbers, and there are 4 complete blocks plus 9 in 480-488. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, does 484 count? Let me check. 484 is within 488, so yes. How many such numbers are there? From 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then an extra 8 pages. But since we're looking for 4's in the units place, in each cycle of 10, there's exactly one 4. So, 48 cycles would give 48 4's. But wait, does the 48th cycle end at 480? So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place beyond the 48th cycle. So, total 4's in the units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each time, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such groups there are. The first group is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, the next would be 140-149, another 10, then 240-249, and so on. The last group would be 440-449, since 449 is less than 488. Wait, 440-449 is the next group after 340-349. So, how many such groups are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 8's. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 49th cycle, which is 480-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check. From 1 to 480, it's 48 times, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So yes, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such group has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such groups there are. 80-89 is the first, 180-189 is the second, 280-289 is the third, 380-389 is the fourth. Now, 480-489 would be the fifth, but since the book ends at 488, the 480-488 range is only 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but wait, 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, but 488 is included. So, from 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, ..., up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers, but wait, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 of them, right? Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many groups of 10 with 8 in the tens place are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 groups, but the last group only has 9 numbers. But for the tens digit, each full group contributes 10 8's, and the last group contributes 9 8's. Wait, no, actually, in the tens place, each group of 100 has one group where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 8's. So, from 0-99: 80-89: 10 8's. 100-199: 180-189: 10 8's. 200-299: 280-289: 10 8's. 300-399: 380-389: 10 8's. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all 9, so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4 groups * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last partial group, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the units place for 4's, I had 48, but let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count. Wait, earlier I thought units place for 4's was 48, but now I'm calculating 49. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the units place for 4's. The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 after that. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said units place for 4's was 48. It should be 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, I had 49, which is correct because 8,18,...,488. Let me check that: 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, for 4's, units place is 49, not 48. That changes things. So, correcting that: 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 4's: 49+50=99, +89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 8's: 49+49=98. So, difference: 188-98=90. Wait, that's different from my earlier 89. So, I must have made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's initially. Let me confirm again. Units place for 4's: numbers ending with 4 from 4 to 484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 4's is 49. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, 49+49=98. Difference: 188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 49, but let me check that again. For 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four groups contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last group contributes 9, as 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there. For 4's in units place, from 4 to 484: the first term is 4, last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 terms. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, total 4's is 188, 8's is 98, difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full range (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's, totaling 40.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 8's (since 488 is included).\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 4 and the last is at 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is within 488, so that's another set. Wait, 480-489 is from 480 to 489, but the book ends at 488, so the last number is 488. So, how many numbers are in 480-488? That's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place 8's: (4*10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me verify. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, n=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So 5 sets, 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. Last term 488, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since 488 < 800) \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a count, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Let's check: 488's units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4, 14, ..., 484, that's 49 times because starting from 4, each 10 numbers gives one 4, and 488 is the upper limit, so 488/10 = 48.8, which we take as 49? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in that position. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48, and then we check if the remainder is more than 4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 is greater than 4, we add 1 more, making it 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. In this group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8 in the 400s. Wait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 is 0-8, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 +10=50. Wait, but wait, from 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total 50. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so in the 400s, we have 401-488. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 4's in hundreds place:89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's:188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, we need to check if 488 is within the range. 488's units digit is 8, so yes, it's included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Wait, let me confirm: from 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the tens place for 4's. Let me recount the tens place for 4's. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct too. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last occurrence before 488 would be 484. To find the total count, I can use the formula: ((Last occurrence - First occurrence) / Step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, 49 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. The count here is from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find the last occurrence. 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four ranges each have 10 numbers, and the last range has 9. So total in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). Similarly, 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, the last block is 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing an 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, which ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. Let me count how many full blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The fifth block contributes 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with an 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98; 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: up to 484, which is 48 times. Correct. For 8's, units place: 49 times, because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Tens place: 5 blocks, but the last one only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers between 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check if 488 is a multiple of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last complete set is 480, meaning 48 times. But actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 is the last page, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so let's see: 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. Because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the count is 49. For example, 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, the hundreds digit can only be 0-9, but since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 can't appear in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the last partial cycle goes from 481 to 488, which includes 484. So, that's another 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, and then the remainder is 8, meaning 8 more numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place, and then from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4. So, total 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have four full blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, does the last block, 440-449, fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10. Wait, no, I think I already included that in the four blocks. Wait, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial cycle from 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8. So, total 48+1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, does 480-489 include any 8's in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place for all these numbers, which is 9 numbers. So, that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 98 8's. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4, and one more in the partial cycle (484).

    "text": " Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0 to 99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's calculate how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488. The common difference is 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Now, from 400-488, does 480-489 fall within? 480-489 would be pages 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is an = a1 + (n-1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10.

Since the book has 488 pages, we have four complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and the last partial hundred is 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, we need to check how many numbers are in 400-488 where the tens digit is 4. So, first, let's count the complete hundreds. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. Now, from 400-488: The tens digit can be 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, total for the tens place: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. Let's see how many numbers are there. From 400 to 488, inclusive. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a1 = 8, d = 10, an = 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488 - 8 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = 10(n-1) \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 in 400-488 is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total for the tens place: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, sum up all the occurrences of 8: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That's correct. For the 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all those 89 numbers. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which seems correct because each hundred block contributes 10, and we have five blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 49 in total. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds for 8's. So, 98 total 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me think again. Is the count for the 4's in the hundreds place correct? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right. Now, let me check if I missed any 4's or 8's. For example, in the units place, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, which I've counted. Similarly, 484 is included in the units place for 4's. Okay, that seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount the ranges, especially in the hundreds place. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately. Let's try that. **Counting 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:** For each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48. But wait, actually, the last set might be incomplete, but in this case, 488 is a multiple of 10? No, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last complete set is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within 480-488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 more in 484, totaling 49. That matches my earlier count.\n\n- **Tens place:** For the tens place, each complete set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, each set of 10 has one 8. From 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48. But wait, in 488, the units digit is 8, so that's included in the 48th set (480-488). So, 48 8's in the units place. Wait, but earlier I counted 49. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488. So, using the formula: an = a1 + (n-1)*d. 488=8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480=(n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 8's in the units place. So, my initial count was correct.\n\n- **Tens place:** For the tens digit 8, each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89). From 1-488, how many complete sets of 100? 4 complete sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last set, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** As before, no numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another way. Maybe using a formula for digit counting.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using a method where we consider each digit position separately, taking into account the higher and lower digits.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it. Alternatively, let me think about each digit position again.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488, plus any extra if the last group isn't complete. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups and 8 extra numbers. Since 4 is within the first 8 numbers of the last group (481-488), the 4 in the units place appears 48 times in the complete groups and once more in the last group. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 is 4-8-8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last occurrence of 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, from 1 to 484, that's 484 numbers. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, and then 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, another 10, 240-249, another 10, 340-349, another 10, and then 440-449, which is another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, and then in the last group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, total groups of 10 are 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 48 * 10 = 480, so the last group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Wait, that's 8 numbers, but actually, in each group of 10, the units digit 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences, and then from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets * 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number contributes one digit, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 48 * 10 = 480, so the last group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, that's an extra 8. So, units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many sets there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total 8's: 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 89 from 188: 188 - 89 = 99.

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 itself is 488, so does 488 end with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 1 to 484, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but 480-488 is still within the book.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it goes beyond 488. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, total 50 times.

So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So, 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is included, so 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me see: 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as the second digit. So, ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place as the third digit. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 89 seems a big difference.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me go back. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me recalculate. The units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times, not 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said 48. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, total 4's would be 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 48, but now it's 49. Let me confirm: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th term? Wait, no. Let me list them:\n\n4: 1st\n14:2nd\n24:3rd\n...\n484: which would be the (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49th term.\n\nSo, yes, 49 times. So, earlier I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds is 0, so total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the units place, thinking it was 48 instead of 49. So, the correct total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? As above, 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 is included, so how many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I first calculated the 4's in the units place, I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49 because 484 is the 49th term. So, that's where the mistake was.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo find this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th cycle ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In the 481-488 range, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, there are 49 times when 4 appears in the units place. Wait, let me check that again. If I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But in the last partial cycle from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only 4 in the units place there. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But in the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit here is 8. Let's see: Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the first four ranges each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, and the last one contributes 9. So, total 40 +9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (including 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last would be 484. To find how many terms there are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, n = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. So, let me count each set:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 140-149: another 10.\n- 240-249: another 10.\n- 340-349: another 10.\n- 440-449: another 10.\n\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: n = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.

    "text": " Let me figure out how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 4 and the last is at 484. The total number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10 and taking the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 \u00f7 10 gives 48 full groups, and then 8 extra numbers. Since 488 is less than 490, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, actually, it's 48 times, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times, each time contributing a 4 once. Wait, but actually, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, and then 8 more numbers. So, the 48th group ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, we have 8 numbers. Since 484 is within this range, the 48th group actually includes 484, so that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 481-488, so yes, 48 times. So, units place: 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (which is the first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, 449 is included, right? Yes, because 449 < 488. So, 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total fours: 187. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times this happens. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so does that mean the 48th group ends at 488? Let me check: 48 \u00d7 10 = 480, so 480 is the last number before 488 in the 48th group. Then, 481-488 is the 49th group, but since 488 is included, does that mean the 488 has an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place. The first term is 8 (which is 1\u00d78), and the last term is 488 (which is 61\u00d78, because 8\u00d761=488). Wait, that can't be right because 8\u00d761 is 488, but the number of terms would be 61? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 488 is the 61st multiple of 8. But wait, no, that's not how it works. Each 8 in the units place occurs every 10 numbers, so the number of times is equal to how many full tens fit into 488. Let me think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of numbers from 1 to 488 that end with 8. The first such number is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The number of terms is equal to the floor division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last term is within the range. Wait, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so the integer part is 48, and since 488 is included, we add 1. So, total number of 8's in units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 8\u00d71=8, 8\u00d72=16, but wait, no, that's not the right way. Each 8 in the units place occurs at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The number of terms is determined by how many numbers are in the sequence where the last digit is 8. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let me count how many full ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last range contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).  \n   - Number of 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - The sequence ends at 488, which is the 49th term.  \n   - Number of 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, and then there's a remainder of 8. But since 488 is the last page, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in each group of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full groups would give 48 times, but wait, let me check. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? The last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, so no, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, units place 4's: 48 times. 2. **Tens place (second digit from the right):** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all those 10 pages are included. So, tens place 4's: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit from the right):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I'm supposed to count how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, for each number from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Now, adding them all up: units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's, let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, so that's included in the 48th group. Wait, but 488 is the 48th group plus 8 more numbers. Wait, actually, each group of 10 ends at 10, 20, ..., 480, and then the next group is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, how many 8's are there? Well, in each full group of 10, there's one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full groups (since 480 is the 48th group), so 48 times. But wait, 480 is included, so 480 has an 8 in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, does that add an extra 8? Wait, no, because 488 is part of the 48th group? Wait, no, 480 is the 48th group, so 481-490 would be the 49th group, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the 49th group, the units digit 8 occurs once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 488) = 49 times. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula is floor(488/10) = 48, and then if the units digit of 488 is >=8, add 1. Since 488's units digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full range (like 80-89) contributes 10 times. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Now, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contribute 10 numbers, so 4 ranges * 10 = 40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place count. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 4 ranges * 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of these, which is 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49, tens place 8's: 49, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. Now, the 4's were 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place count for 8's. Let me go through that again. For units place 8's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus 1 if the last number is >=8. Since 488 ends with 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place 8's: The ranges are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, for the 4's: units place was 48, tens place was 50, hundreds place was 89, totaling 187. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the counts again, maybe I missed something.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, if the units digit is 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers can be calculated as follows: The first number is 4, and the last is 484. The difference between each is 10, so the count is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place 4's: 49 times.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 48, but that's incorrect. It's actually 49. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges *10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers, so yes, 50 times.\n\nFor the hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 187, but actually it's 188. Let me check that again. 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nSo, 188 4's.\n\nNow, 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total: 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, now I'm getting 90. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake in the units place for 4's earlier. Let me confirm.\n\nUnits place 4's: numbers ending with 4 from 1 to 488.\n\nThe first number is 4, the last is 484. The count is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488.\n\nFirst number 8, last number 488. Count is ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place 4's: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nTens place 8's: 5 ranges, but the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 89 numbers (400-488).\n\nHundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought units place 4's were 48. It's actually 49.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nWait, let me recount the units place 4's. The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: 8,18,...,488. Same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place 4's: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nTens place 8's:80-89(10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place 4's:400-488. That's 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Ranges: 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each (4 \u00d7 10 = 40).\n   - Last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks would be 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. So, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, and then we check if 488 ends with 8. Yes, it does, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks would be 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, 389 is less than 488. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. So, 40 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times 8 appears in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 8 appears 89 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. Difference: 187 - 89 = 98. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. The last one is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier count. Wait, no, 484 is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full groups, but since 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because starting from 4 as the first occurrence, then 14 is the second, so 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place should be 49, not 48. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, units place for 4's: 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, I had 49, which seems correct because 488 ends with 8, so it's the 49th occurrence. So, let me adjust the 4's count. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. So, difference: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, so I think I initially miscalculated the units place for 4's, it's 49, not 48. Because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, that changes the total. Let me confirm: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Yes, so 49 times. So, the correct total for 4's is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's are 49 + 40 = 89. So, difference is 188 - 89 = 99. So, I think the initial answer was 98, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 99. Let me check again: 4's units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. 8's units:49, tens:40. 49+40=89. 188-89=99. So, the correct answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks *10=50. That's correct because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 is correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:40, correct. So, 89. So, difference is 99. So, I think the correct answer is 99. Wait, but in the initial problem, the book has 488 pages, so the last page is 488. So, let me check if 488 is included in the counts. For 4's, in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 488, so 89 numbers. For 8's, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, yes, all counts are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 89, so 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds), we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 89 times. Subtracting these gives the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then a partial cycle from 481 to 488. Each full cycle has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial cycle from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included here, which adds one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds go up to 400, 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 400-488. So, how many complete hundreds have a 4 in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49 is in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, 240-249 in the third, and 340-349 in the fourth. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, but wait, 400-488: the tens digit in 400-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, up to 480-488 is 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so adding 10 more. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48 full cycles (1-480) give 48 4's, plus 484, so 49. Tens: 4 blocks of 10 each (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) = 40, plus 440-449 = 10, total 50. Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial cycle from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89 is in the first hundred, 180-189 in the second, 280-289 in the third, 380-389 in the fourth. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 in 480-488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but 488 is included. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Each of these has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are four such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 40. In 440-449, another 10 occurrences are added, making it 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, 488 adds one more, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 40. In 480-488, there are 9 more occurrences, making it 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is included, so maybe I should check if 488 has a 4 in the units place. No, 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4, 14, ..., 484, that's 49 numbers because starting from 4, each step is +10, and the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct count for units place 4's is 49. Let me confirm: For units digit 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The last number is 488, which is included. So, starting from 8, each step +10. Number of terms: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, each range contributes 10 numbers except the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's printed:98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 8's from 4's:188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th cycle would end at 480, so the next 4 would be at 484, which is within 488. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Let me check that: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yep, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Now, 440-449 would be another block, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is still within 488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10. So, how many blocks is that? Let's count: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Wait, but I'm only counting the 4's in the hundreds place, right? So, yes, 89. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 8 in the units place occurs at 488. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another block, but the book ends at 488, so only 480-488. Let's check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, how many full blocks do we have? 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and then 480-488 (5, but only 9 numbers). So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems right. For the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Okay, so I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89 and 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the last number before 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete blocks of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times, right? Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last block is 480-488, which is a complete block except for the last 8 numbers. But since 484 is within that block, that's still the 48th 4 in the units place. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let's see, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is the last digit. So, starting at 4, every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? Let's see, the first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. I think it's 49 times. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 480-489). But since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, each full decade contributes one 4, so 48 times, but then in the last partial decade, 480-488, the units digit is 4 at 484, which is within this range. So, that's an extra 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, total 50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. Let's see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count how many full blocks and the partial one. Full blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488. The tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, so how many are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 4 full blocks (40) and 9 in the partial block, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many terms there are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but I should check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. So, pages 400-488. Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. Let me find how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 ends with an 8, so the last one is 488. Let me calculate how many terms there are. First term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included, but 489 is beyond. So, the tens place 8's occur in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last one from 480-488 has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but wait, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the last page number with a 4 in the units place before 488. So, how many such numbers are there? Let me calculate. Starting from 4, each subsequent occurrence is 10 pages apart. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each block have a 4 in the tens place. Each block has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is in the first 100 pages, 140-149 in the next 100, and so on up to 440-449. So that's 5 blocks (since 400-449 is the fifth block). Wait, but 440-449 is the fifth block. But the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. Now, how many numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is included, so let's see how many such numbers there are. Starting from 8, each subsequent is 10 apart. The last one is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last part. Let me count how many blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers apart: 80-89 (first 100), 180-189 (next 100), 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 -480 +1=9). Wait, no, actually, 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each block except the last contributes 10 occurrences, and the last contributes 9. So, number of 8's in tens place: 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the last one because 488 is the end, but 484 is within 488. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, and then 8 extra numbers. But actually, for the units place, in each full ten, 4 appears once. So, in 488 numbers, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1, which is 48, but wait, I need to check if 488 includes 488 or not. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times 4 in the units place, which is 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't have that. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times the tens digit is 4. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check the last one: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's included. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place again. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full tens? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and 8 extra numbers. In each full ten, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. Now, for the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, I'm a bit confused because when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That seems right. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 10*4 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for 8: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 more in 488, so 49. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, total number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so does that mean there are 48 full sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 pages? So, the 48th set would be 480-488, right? So, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's would be 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, and then 480-488, but 480-488's tens digit is 8, so 440-449 is the last set where the tens digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because from 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Hmm, but wait, 400-488 is actually 89 numbers, right? So, 440-449 is within that. So, yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. That occurs in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that would be the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think. From 1-488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full decade, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full decades would give 48 8's, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the book's page limit. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count them: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80 to 89) \u2192 10 8's in tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? It's 9, because 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so that's 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) gives 10 8's, and the last one (480-488) gives 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98? Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but wait, did I count correctly? Let me go through the 8's again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then the last set (481-488) has one more 8 at 488. So, 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Units place: 48. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. So, 48 +50=98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. 8's: 98. So, 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and from 400-488, another 10.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check: from 1 to 480, every 10 numbers have one 4 in units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is included. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me think: from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each range from 80-89, etc., contributes 10 numbers. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the total number would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check if 488 is included. The last 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another block. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. But wait, does the last block (440-449) go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so 5 blocks. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units place 48 + tens place 50 + hundreds place 89 = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of multiples of 10 is 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,...,481-490), but 488 is within 481-490, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds, so 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 488 is beyond 400, but the next block would be 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, does that affect the count? Yes, because 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but we only have 9 numbers (480-488) with 8 in the tens place. So, in the hundreds place, the 480-488 block is part of the 400-499 range, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens place 8's in that block are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's would be: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units place 49 + tens place 49 + hundreds place 0 = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that's a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. First, for the 4's: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 187. For the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, 484 is the last one. So, 484 is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, up to 488, the last 8 is in 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, 49 times. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4 full blocks and a partial one with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 0. So, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. Total 8's: 49+49+0=98. Difference: 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the last page number with a 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last one with a 4 in the units place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 4 to 484, that's every 10 pages. So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting full cycles, there are 48 full tens, and then 8 more pages. So, in each ten, the units digit is 4 once. So, 48 times, plus in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. From 1-10: 4 once. 11-20: 14 once. So, each ten contributes 1. So, from 1-480, there are 48 tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't because the book stops at 488. So, let's count how many times the tens digit is 4. Each of these ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times the tens digit is 4. But wait, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, but the units digit can be 0-9, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units place for 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Tens place: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when counting the units place, I had 49, but let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), there's one more 4 (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, for the tens digit 8, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and one partial range (480-488) contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, etc. So, 4 ranges \u00d710=40, plus 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in page numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For 4's: hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. For 8's: hundreds place: 0. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49. So, 49 +49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 full ranges and one partial. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. Is 480-488 9 numbers? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9. So, the tens place for 8's is 49. So, the total 8's are 49 (tens) +49 (units)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Tens place: 50, units:49. So, 89+50=139, +49=188. So, yes, that's correct. So, the final answer is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and then sum them up. For 4's: Units place: as before, 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place:89. Total:188. For 8's: Units place:49. Tens place:49. Hundreds place:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. So, yes, that seems consistent. I think I've double-checked enough. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one '4', totaling 48.\n     - In the last partial decade (481-488), '4' appears once (484).\n     - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n     - Each range contributes 10 instances, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n     - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one '8', totaling 48.\n     - In the last partial decade (481-488), '8' appears once (488).\n     - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n     - The first four ranges contribute 10 instances each, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 instances.\n     - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n     - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers there are. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find the count, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, starting from 4, the first occurrence is 4, which is page 4, and the last is 484. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, that seems right because from 4 to 484, every 10th number has a 4 in the units place, and there are 49 such numbers. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, the next is 18, and so on. The last one is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: that's one set, contributing 10 8's. 180-189: another, 10 8's. 280-289: another, 10 8's. 380-389: another, 10 8's. Now, 480-488: this is a partial set because 489 is beyond 488. So, how many numbers are there from 480 to 488? That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many times does this happen? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete blocks of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 480-488, which is a partial block. But since 484 is within this block, that's another 4. So, actually, it's 48 full blocks (1-480) plus one more in 484, making it 49 4's in the units place. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the units digit of 488 is 4 or higher. But 488 ends with 8, so the units digit is 8, which is higher than 4, so we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, specifically in the 40-49 range, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the units digit of 488 is 8 or higher. Since 488 ends with 8, which is exactly 8, so we add 1. So, 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is within 488, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and the next would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is a partial block. So, how many full blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, the partial block 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total 40 +9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Wait, let me confirm that. Units:49, Tens:49, so 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: Units=49, Tens=50, Hundreds=89, total 188. For 8's: Units=49, Tens=49, Hundreds=0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, right? Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 is included once more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so when I do 488 divided by 10, it's 48 full tens, which gives 48 times, and then in the 49th ten, which is 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once. So yes, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (like 40-49). So from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? Well, 400 divided by 100 is 4, so there are 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So in total, 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of 400-499, which is beyond 488, but since 449 is less than 488, it's included. So yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the hundreds place. From 400-488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So that's correct. So total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens digit occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is included. Let's count: Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since 488 is the last page, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98. But wait, let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So total 8's are 98. Wait, no: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me recount that. From 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's every number from 400 to 488, inclusive. So 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So that's correct, 89 times. So 4's total is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. For 8's, units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0, total 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, when counting 4's in the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, up to 480-488, which is correct.\n\nWait another thought: when counting the tens place for 4's, from 40-49 is 10 numbers, but when we get to 440-449, that's another 10 numbers. So 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 1-488, how many full blocks of 100 are there? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, 400-488 is another partial block. So in each of the first four blocks, the tens digit 4 occurs once per block, contributing 10 numbers each. So 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, we have 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit 8 occurs for 9 numbers (480-488). So total 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total cycles of 10 in 488: 48 full cycles + 1 extra (481-488).\n   - Count: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each 100-number block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks * 10 = 40.\n   - From 440-449: 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488.\n   - Count: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total cycles: 48 full + 1 extra (481-488).\n   - Count: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks * 10 = 40.\n   - From 480-488: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (800+).\n   - Count: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, does 484 count? Yes, because it's within 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me see. The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 484 is the last one before 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a 10-page block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks of 10, totaling 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, then every 10 pages. The last one is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, 9 times.\n\nAdding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Let me figure out how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers contributes one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but actually, 488 is the last page, so the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: starting from 4, every 10th number. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, I was wrong earlier. It's actually 49 times because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let's compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let me count how many such numbers there are. Starting from 8, every 10 numbers. The last one is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if there's a 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, but only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so each of those 9 has an 8 in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one block of 9, contributing 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Fours are 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check again. Maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Units place for fours: 49, which is correct because 484 is the last one. Tens place for fours: 50, correct because 5 blocks of 10. So, 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 48 times, and then in the last partial group from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in entire blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which is from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial group, 488 is included, which is another 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place in 4's, 5 blocks of 10, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place, 49, because 488/10=48.8, so 49. For 8's, units place same as 4's: 49. Tens place: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so 49. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the last one before 488, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the total number would be the total number of tens places. Let me see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full tens. But wait, the last set is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we can't have 0.8 of a page. Actually, the number of complete sets of 10 is 48, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then we have the 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does the last range, 440-449, go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit from the right. This would be from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is included, so 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the last page 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, how many ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 occurrences, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place is (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units (48), tens (50), hundreds (89). 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0). 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the units place. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. But wait, 484 is the 48th, but 488 is the last page. So, does that mean that 484 is the 48th occurrence, and there's no 49th because 488 doesn't have a 4 in the units place. So, units place for 4 is 48 times. That seems correct. For the 8's in the units place, it's 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, 49 times. So, that part is correct. For the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times, correct. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, correct. So, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. Total 8's: 49+49+0=98. Difference:187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me see how many such numbers there are. Since the last page is 488, the last number with 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many sets of 10 are there up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10. But wait, in each set of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so the 4 appears exactly once in each set. So, that would be 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 fall within that? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This is from page 400 to 488. Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let me calculate that. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so does that mean the 8 in 488 is counted? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so 48 full sets would end at 480, and then 481-488 would be the next set, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 8: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let's count how many blocks: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). Wait, does 480-488 have 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total for tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place for 8: 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8. Let me recount that. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as floor division. The number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 /10 =48.8). Each decade contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. That's correct. Similarly, for the tens place: each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 is correct. Therefore, the difference is 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " I need to figure out how many such numbers there are. Since the book has 488 pages, the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 sets would be up to 480, right? So from 1 to 480, there are 48 numbers ending with 4. Then, from 481 to 488, the next number ending with 4 would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so it's 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. So, the units place would have 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences of 4. Hmm, but wait, 480 is the 48th multiple of 10, so 480 + 4 = 484 is the 49th occurrence. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the next number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, how many full ranges are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 480-488, it's 9 times. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89 and 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, actually, the last complete set of 10 is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms are there? The nth term can be represented as 10n - 6, where n starts at 1. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many numbers between 1 and 488 have 4 in the units place. The first such number is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. Let me compute that: (488 - 4) is 484, divided by 10 is 48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as starting at 4, then adding 10 each time. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, adding 10 each time. The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one, 480-488. Let's check each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, but since it's 9 numbers, how many 8's in the tens place? Each number from 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, for the first four blocks, 4 blocks * 10 = 40, and the last block is 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
