    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. Each set of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count these blocks. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but does 480-488 include any 8's in the tens place? 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. However, in the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place for all 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the four blocks) + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 4 in our case, since the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, but 8 never appears in the hundreds place here. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades contribute 48 eights, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 eights, totaling 40. Pages 480-488 add 9 more, making 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No eights appear here.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last page with a 4 in the units place would be 484. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The tens place can be 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. Each hundred has a set of ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is in the 400s, so we have the 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. So, in each of these, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 100s: 140-149 (10 numbers), 200s: 240-249 (10), 300s: 340-349 (10), and 400s: 440-449 (10). But wait, in the 400s, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and since 488 is higher, that's fine. So, that's 4 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but let me check if in the 400s, after 449, we have 450-488, but the tens digit isn't 4 there. So, yes, 440-449 is the only set in the 400s with tens digit 4. So, 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's: 4 * 10 = 40. So, 40 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178. Now, let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently, using a formula. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by looking at each digit place separately. So, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times 4 appears.\n\nWait, maybe I should recount the 4's again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1-488, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 * 1 = 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is in the 400s, so there are four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 is the third, 300-399 is the fourth, and 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in each complete hundred (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but now I'm considering 5 sets, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth hundred. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the count. Let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's every 100 numbers, so 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's five sets. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me check with specific examples.\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4.\n- 140-149: another 10.\n- 240-249: another 10.\n- 340-349: another 10.\n- 440-449: another 10.\n\nSo, that's five sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that would mean 50 4's in the tens place. But earlier I thought 40. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 488 is the last page. So, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, total 5 sets, 50 4's in the tens place. So, that would mean I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 40. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place: 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 178, but now it's 188. Hmm, perhaps I need to recount.\n\nWait, let's do it more carefully.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete decades (1-480), each contributing one 4 in the units place: 48.\n\nThen, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place: 1 more. So, total 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4?\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nThat's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178, but now it's 188. So, perhaps I was correct the second time.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. The total number of 4's can be calculated using a formula. For each digit place, we can calculate the number of times 4 appears.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - 4 + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nn = 488.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = (488 // 10) * 1 + min(max(488 % 10 - 4 + 1, 0), 10)\n\n488 // 10 = 48.\n\n488 % 10 = 8.\n\nSo, max(8 - 4 + 1, 0) = max(5, 0) = 5.\n\nBut min(5, 10) =5.\n\nWait, but that would suggest 48 + 5 =53. But that's not matching my earlier count of 49. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is:\n\nFor units digit, the number of times d appears is (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that in each group of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once. The number of complete groups is n // 10. Then, in the incomplete group, if the last digit is >=4, we add 1, else 0.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= 4 else 0)\n\nSo, for n=488:\n\nn//10 = 48.\n\nn%10 =8, which is >=4, so add 1.\n\nTotal units 4's: 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nNumber of complete hundreds = n // 100.\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place = (n // 100) * 10.\n\nThen, check the remaining part beyond the complete hundreds.\n\nLet me define:\n\nhigh = n // 100\n\ncurrent = (n // 10) % 10\n\nlow = n % 10\n\nIf current > 4, then add 10.\n\nIf current ==4, then add low +1.\n\nWait, maybe that's a more accurate way.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\ncount = high * 10\n\ncurrent_tens = (n // 10) % 10\n\nif current_tens > 4:\n    count += 10\nelif current_tens ==4:\n    count += (n % 10) +1\n\nSo, for n=488:\n\nhigh = 488 // 100 =4\n\ncurrent_tens = (488 //10) %10 = (48) %10 =8\n\nSince current_tens=8 >4, we add 10.\n\nSo, count =4*10 +10=50.\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nSo, units digit:49, tens digit:50, hundreds digit: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178, but now it's 188. So, perhaps I was correct the second time.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds digit again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll follow the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many 8's in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades:488//10=48, so 48 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\nIn the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more.\n\nSo, total units 8's:48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of that.\n\nSo, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is in the 400s, so we have:\n\n- 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199:180-189 (10)\n- 200-299:280-289 (10)\n- 300-399:380-389 (10)\n- 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10.\n\nSo, total tens 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from the first four hundreds) and 9 from the last partial set.\n\nWait, but actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens 8's: (4*10) +9=40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nWait, but let me check again.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place: in each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total tens 8's:40+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178, but now it's 188. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's again using the formula approach.\n\nFor each digit place:\n\n- Units digit:49\n- Tens digit:50\n- Hundreds digit:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units digit:49\n- Tens digit:49\n- Hundreds digit:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds digit for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nTens digit for 4's:50.\n\nUnits digit for 4's:49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits digit:49.\n\nTens digit:49.\n\nHundreds digit:0.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the number 444, does that count as three 4's? Yes, because each digit is a separate count. So, in 444, we have a 4 in the hundreds, tens, and units place. So, each digit is counted separately. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 488 has two 8's in the tens and units place, so each is counted separately.\n\nSo, the total counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 4's.\n   - In the last partial set (481-488), 484 adds one more 4.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are five such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each set contributes 10 4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets, contributing 48 8's.\n   - In the last partial set (481-488), 488 adds one more 8.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are four complete sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 8's.\n   - In the last partial set (400-488), 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let me see how many such blocks there are up to 488. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, the tens place can have 4 in the following ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50. However, wait, from 400-488, the tens place can go up to 8, so the 440-449 is fine, but let me check if there's any overlap or if I'm missing something. No, I think that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but page numbers start at 400, so 400 is included, and 488 is the last. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Plus, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 48+1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers here (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, no, let me recount. The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so that's 4*10=40. Then 480-488 contributes 9, so total 40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the 4's again: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now for 8's: units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for 4's, I thought there were 5 ranges each contributing 10, so 50. Let me confirm that. The ranges where the tens digit is 4 are: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. That's correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. Now, for the 8's: units place, from 1-488, every 10 numbers has an 8 in the units place, which is 48 times, plus the extra 8 in 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place, and 49 in units, total 98. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times (5 ranges \u00d7 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles plus 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times (4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, it's every 10th number, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 times. Wait, but let me check: the first 4 is at page 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, it's actually 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89), but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, that's 89 times. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10th number ends with 8. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The last number is 488, which ends with 8, so it's included. So, starting at 8, every 10 pages. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place of 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? The first four blocks (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10, and the last one contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10th page (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( \\frac{488}{10} = 48.8 \\)  \n   Since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part and add 1 for the last occurrence:  \n   \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10th page (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( \\frac{488}{10} = 48.8 \\)  \n   Taking the integer part and adding 1:  \n   \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, the first occurrence is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many such numbers there are, I can calculate how many full groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within this range. So, that's one more. So, total 48 +1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so after 480, the next 4 in the units place is 484, which is page 484, which is within 481-488. So, yes, that's correct, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. That would be numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, from 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Then, from 401-500: 440-449, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50. Wait, but wait, let me check: from 1-100: 40-49, 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149, 10. 201-300: 240-249, 10. 301-400: 340-349, 10. 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, since 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the next 8 in the units place is 488, which is the last page. So, that's one more. So, total 48 +1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10. 201-300: 280-289, 10. 301-400: 380-389, 10. 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 -480 +1 =9). So, let's add these up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. So, total 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers. Each block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 484 fall into this? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but does the last block (400-488) have a full 10 numbers? 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, it's 10 numbers. So total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times does this happen? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 is included, so that's another 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block has 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: from 1-99: 80-89 (1 block), 100-199: 180-189 (1 block), 200-299: 280-289 (1 block), 300-399: 380-389 (1 block), and 400-488: 480-488 (which is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So total 8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and one partial decade (481-488). Each full decade contributes 1 four, totaling 48. The partial decade adds 1 more (484). Total units place 4's: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours. Total tens place 4's: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and one partial decade (481-488). Each full decade contributes 1 eight, totaling 48. The partial decade adds 1 more (488). Total units place 8's: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, totaling 40. The partial block 480-488 contributes 9 eights. Total tens place 8's: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the last page is 488, so the units digit can go up to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many such groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's 48 times, but let me check. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full tens, so 48 times. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10 times. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10 times. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last group is 481-488, so 488 is included, which has 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, so that's 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 488 is the 49th term. Let me recalculate. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of numbers from 1 to 488 that end with 8. The first such number is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is given by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, 4's are printed 89 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, but we take the integer part).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so no. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, but let me check. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. So, counting how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 ends with 8, so does that count as an extra? Let me see: the last number is 488, which is the 489th number? Wait no, page 1 is the first, so page 488 is the 488th page. So, the units digit cycles every 10, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the 48th cycle ends at 480, then 481-488. So, 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's an additional 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (488) = 49. Wait, but wait, 488 is the 488th page, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's think differently. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=8, add 1). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since the last number is 488, which ends with 8, which is >=8, so we add 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, because 488 is the end). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? 4 blocks with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block with 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 times. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. Counting 4's: units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. Counting 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 appears in the tens place there. So, in the tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49. So, total 98. 4's:187. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, with an extra count for 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th set. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when you count from 4 to 484 with a step of 10, you actually have 49 numbers. Let me confirm: 4 is the first, then 14, 24,..., 484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, divided by 10 is 48, so adding 1 gives 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many complete sets are there? 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but 8's. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488 with step 10. The difference is 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, so number of terms is 48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total for tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 480-488 which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4. So, total blocks of 10 in 488 pages are 488 / 10 = 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, I think we take the integer part, which is 48 blocks, giving 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so the 48th block ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, we have 8 more numbers.

Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes one block of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 blocks * 10 = 40 fours. Now, check if there's a partial hundred after 400. From 400-488, the tens place can be 4 in 440-449. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 fours. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50. Hmm, but wait, 4*10 would be 40, plus 10 makes 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So total hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48 fours, and then 484 adds one more, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) gives 4*10=40, and then 440-449 in the 400-488 range adds another 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, check if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, and it ends with an 8, so that's another one. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, how many full hundreds? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes one block of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, check if there's a partial hundred after 400. From 400-488, the tens digit can be 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each of these has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my calculations again. 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So that's correct. Similarly, for 4's, in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks (480 numbers) + 1 additional number (484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - Total hundreds: 4 full hundreds (1-400) + 1 partial hundred (400-488).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - The partial hundred (400-488) includes 440-449, contributing 10 more.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - Total blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full blocks (480 numbers) + 1 additional number (488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - Total hundreds: 4 full hundreds (1-400) + 1 partial hundred (400-488).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - The partial hundred (400-488) includes 480-488, contributing 9 more (480-488).\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Let me count how many full groups of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so does 40-49 exist in 401-488? Wait no, because 401-488 starts at 401, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is within 401-488. Wait, no, 440-449 is part of 401-500, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is included. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total in tens place is 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because in each hundred before 400, the tens digit 4 occurs once every hundred, so 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers), 101-200: 140-149 (10), 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10). So that's 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48, correct. Tens: 50, correct. Hundreds: 89, correct. So 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's see. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last one is 488, which is included, so 49 times? Wait, because 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's count: 8 is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many full groups of 100 there are. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). Then, 401-488: 480-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place: 4 full hundreds each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 8's. But earlier, I had 187 4's. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 48. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. Correct. Now, 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each (40) plus 9, total 49. Units place: 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, the last one is 484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 / 10 = 48.4, but since we're counting whole numbers, it's 48. So, 48 units place 4's. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, up to 488, which is included, so 49. That seems right. So, yes, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 484 is the 48th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and in the 400s, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total occurrences: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (including 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and in the 400s, 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 include a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Hmm, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which suggests that there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. So, units place: 48 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many eights in the tens place here? Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. But the last block only has 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., gives 10 eights. So, 4 blocks give 40, and the last block from 480-488 gives 9 eights because 488 is the last page. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, comparing the total number of 4's and 8's: 4's are 187, 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 fours (since 488/10=48.8, but only 48 full tens, so 48 fours).\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449) each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours (from 400-488).\nTotal: 48+50=98 +89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights (from 8 to 488, step 10, which is 49 numbers).\n- Tens place: 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) each 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since (488 - 8) \u00f7 10 + 1 = 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Partial block: 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 4, and the last one before 488 is 484. So, how many numbers is that? From 4 to 484, each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're looking at units place, it's 48 full sets. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last units place with 4 is 484, which is within 480-489. So, 488 is beyond 484, so maybe it's 48 times? Wait, no, let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 after that. So, the count is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 is the last page, and 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last 4 in units place is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. That happens from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of the book. So, let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, no: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, starting at 8, which is the first occurrence, then every 10. So, the count is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have overcounted. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total 4's: 187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 98. So, difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I counted 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, total 49. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so total 49. So, 49 in tens place. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. Since the book goes up to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. Does 4 appear here? Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more time. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers, and in each, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me count how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. In each group, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count how many times this happens. Each block is 100 numbers, so: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 -480 +1=9). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units: 49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is within that range, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, any number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last group, 480-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place as well, but I'm only considering the tens place here. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes from 0-8. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? 4 times 10 from the first four hundreds, and then 9 from the last partial hundred. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 1-399, each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds (1-399) would be 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. But wait, in the tens place for 4's, I had 50. Let me see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each of 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For 8's, tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9=49. Correct. Units place for both is 48 each, since 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles. Wait, but 488 is included, so for units digit 8, 488 is counted, so units digit 8 appears 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th group. Wait, let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 8 appears in 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481-488. So, in each group of 10, the units digit 8 appears once, except the last group, which may be incomplete. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last group (481-488) has 8 numbers, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, total units digit 8's: 48 +1=49. Wait, so earlier I thought units digit 8's were 48, but actually it's 49. Did I make a mistake earlier? Let me check. If I have 488 pages, the units digit 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units digit 8's are 49, not 48. Similarly, for units digit 4's: the last term would be 484, which is within 488. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so units digit 4's are 49, not 48. Wait, so earlier I thought units digit 4's were 48, but actually it's 49. So, I need to correct that. Let me redo the counts. For 4's: units place: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 49 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but earlier I had 187-97=90. Hmm, so either way, the difference is 90. But I think I made a mistake in the units place counts initially. Let me clarify. For units digit 4's: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, units digit 8's: 8,18,28,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, earlier I had mistakenly thought units digit 4's were 48, but actually it's 49. So, correcting that, the total 4's are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's were 97, but that was because I had miscalculated the units digit 4's as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct counts are 4's=188, 8's=98, difference=90. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but we only complete 48 full blocks). Wait, but that might not be accurate because 488 is not a multiple of 10. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the same as the number of complete tens in 488, which is 48, plus any extra. But since 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit cycles 48 full times, and then an extra 8. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, but wait, in each block of 10, the 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks exist in 488 pages. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks would contribute 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place each. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers from 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let's do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, similar to the 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 /10=48.8). But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), and then 481-488. So, in each block, one 8 in units place, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: since 488 is the last page, this block is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, no: 488 - 480 +1 =9 numbers. But the tens digit is 8 in all these, so how many 8's in the tens place here? Each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's in the tens place. The last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480/10 = 48 numbers ending with 4. But wait, 488 is included, so does 488 end with 4? No, it ends with 8, so the last number ending with 4 before 488 would be 484. So, 484 is the 48th number ending with 4. Therefore, the count for units place 4's is 48. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be beyond 488? No, 440-449 is within 488, right? So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 0-488, there are five sets of 100: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of these sets, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, for 0-99, 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, for 100-199, 140-149: 10 numbers. Same for 200-299, 240-249: 10. 300-399, 340-349: 10. And 400-488, 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is included, so the last number ending with 8 is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms there are, we can think of it as starting at 8 and ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range for the hundreds place 4 and tens place 8. So, how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: let's see, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total: 187. For the 8's: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. Total: 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly for the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 48. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. For the 8's: units place: 49, because starting at 8, ending at 488, which is the 49th term. Tens place: 49, because in each 100, except the last one, there are 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, and in the last 100 (400-488), it's 9 numbers. So, 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in the units place 48 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th block ends at 480, and the 49th block is 481-488. In the 49th block, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, yes, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), and in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, just like 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's in the units place. But wait, let me check: 488 is the last page, so the 49th block is 481-488. The units digit in this block goes up to 8, so 8 appears once here. So, actually, the total is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, because in the 49th block, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 481-488) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. The first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 8's, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last block, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the block 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is the 49th group starting from 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, how many 4's? Let me think again. Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, except maybe the last group if it's incomplete. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, so 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place here. So total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. From 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149: another 10. From 201-300: 240-249: another 10. From 301-400: 340-349: another 10. From 401-488: 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, 48 8's. Wait, but 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears in 488, so that's one more. Wait, no, because 488 is part of the 480-489 group, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 8 appears in 488, so that's an extra 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 488) = 49. Wait, let me check again. From 1-480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 8's. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference: 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems right. But let me check again for 4's in the tens place. I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for 8's: 48 from 1-480, plus 1 in 488, total 49. Correct. Units place for 4's: 48 from 1-480, none in 481-488, so 48. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, yes, the difference is 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences. From 481 to 488, there are none. Total: 48.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences. Total: 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences. In 488, there's one more. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the last page, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, starting from 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first one is 4, and the last one is 484. The difference between them is 484 - 4 = 480, and since they're spaced every 10, that's 480 / 10 = 48. But wait, that counts the steps between them, so the number of terms is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, when you divide 480 by 10, you get 48 intervals, which means 49 numbers. But let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is within 1-488. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, only the hundreds digit is 4, so all these numbers have 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so let's see how many such numbers there are. Starting from 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The difference is 488 - 8 = 480. Divided by 10, that's 48 intervals, so 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. Since 489 is beyond 488, the last range is 380-389. So, how many ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, but 80 is within 1-488, so that's fine. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, four ranges, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 8's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89 times. Wait, that's 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 89 is indeed 99, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That seems correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Now for 8's. Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. That's four ranges, each 10 numbers, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any overlap or something I missed? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, does that include numbers where the tens or units digit is 8? But we're only counting the hundreds digit as 4, so that's fine. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, but page 88 would have two 8's, right? Wait, but in my counting, I'm counting each occurrence of the digit, not the number of numbers. So, for example, in 88, the digit 8 appears twice, so that would count as two 8's. Similarly, in 188, it's two 8's. Wait, but in my previous counting, when I counted 80-89 as 10 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place, but in reality, each of those 10 numbers has an 8 in the tens place, but some might have 8 in the units place as well. But in my method, I'm counting the number of times 8 appears in each position separately, so for the tens place, it's 10 per range, regardless of what's in the units place. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, I'm counting each occurrence, regardless of other digits. So, I think my method is correct. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99. So, 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, let me check how many times this happens. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page is 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once here as well (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149: 10 numbers. 201-300: 240-249: 10 numbers. 301-400: 340-349: 10 numbers. 401-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 5*10=50. But wait, 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, when I was counting the units place, I thought 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and a partial group. So, 48*1=48, plus 1 in the partial group, total 49. That seems correct. For the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full group, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. In the partial group, 488 is included, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once here (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189: 10 numbers. 201-300: 280-289: 10 numbers. 301-400: 380-389: 10 numbers. 401-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 4's. That seems correct. Units place: 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, plus one in the last partial group, total 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 48 full groups, 48, plus one in the last partial group (488), total 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four is 10 numbers, the last is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences.  \n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484).  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in all page numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - There are 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 occurrences.  \n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 8 appears once (488).  \n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at 484, which is within 488. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which actually means 48 full groups, each with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so the last range would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, yes, 5 ranges, 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier with the 4's. Let me correct that. For the 4's in the units place, from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups, each with a 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so no additional 4's. So, 48 fours. But for the 8's, from 1 to 488, the units digit 8 occurs at 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: that's one range, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another, another 10. 280-289: another, 10. 380-389: another, 10. 480-488: this is a partial range because the book ends at 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these pages. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. Similarly for 180-189, etc., each is 10. But 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from page 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the 4's were 187 and the 8's were 98, so the difference would be 89. But let me double-check the counts. Let me recount the eights:\n\nUnits place: 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Plus, the partial range 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 8, so 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, yes, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 full ranges and a partial one, totaling 49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the fours were 187. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the fours count because that seems high. Let's go through it again.\n\nFours:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is within 488. So, how many terms? (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, but the last group ends at 480, so from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4's. So, the number of fours in the units place is 48, because from 4 to 484, that's 48 fours. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for the eights, it's 49 because 488 is included.\n\nSo, maybe I made a mistake earlier when counting the fours in the units place. Let me correct that.\n\nFours in units place: 48.\n\nFours in tens place: 5 ranges (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nFours in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 +89= 187.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) =98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because when I recount the fours in the units place, I get 48, but when I think of it as starting at 4 and going up by 10 each time, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=48+1=49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see: from 4 to 484, how many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's 49 terms. So, earlier I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, I made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, correcting that, fours in units place:49.\n\nFours in tens place:50.\n\nFours in hundreds place:89.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place was 89, which is correct because 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, total fours:188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49)=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, I need to resolve this discrepancy.\n\nLet me recount the fours in the units place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nNumber of terms: Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full groups, but since 484 is included, it's 49 terms.\n\nSo, 49 fours in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the eights in the units place, it's 49 terms, as 488 is included.\n\nSo, fours in units place:49.\n\nFours in tens place:5 ranges (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nFours in hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights in units place:49.\n\nEights in tens place:4 full ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each with 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Plus, the partial range 480-488, which is 9 eights (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49.\n\nEights in hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, total fours:188.\n\nTotal eights:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought the difference was 89, but now it's 90. So, where did I go wrong initially?\n\nI think the initial mistake was in the count of fours in the units place. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49 because 484 is the 49th term. So, that changes the total fours from 187 to 188, making the difference 90 instead of 89.\n\nBut let me make sure about the tens place for fours. The ranges are 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, hundreds place:400-488 is 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nUnits place:49 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:4 full ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) contributing 40 eights, plus 480-488 contributing 9 eights, total 49.\n\nSo, eights total:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not missing any eights in the hundreds place. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, no eights there.\n\nSimilarly, for fours, the hundreds place is only from 400-488, so 89 fours.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences because 484 is the 49th term in this sequence.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences because 488 is the 49th term.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each (totaling 40), and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 would go up to 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488's units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so 480 + 4 is 484. So yes, 48 times. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, pages from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? It's floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 ends with 8, so does that count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contribute 10 numbers, but the last one, 480-488, contributes only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the counts: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48 + 49 is 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place of 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full tens ranges (each 10 numbers) and one partial range of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That's correct. So, 4's:187, 8's:97. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484. Let me see how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Actually, for the units place, the number of times 4 appears is the number of times the units digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 as the units digit? That's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 484 is less than 488, we have exactly 48 numbers. Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. Okay, so units place gives 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is included. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4 (400-488). So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount in any place. Let's go through each digit again. For 4's: Units place: every 10 numbers, 4,14,...,484. As I calculated, 49 times. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 ranges, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 can go up to 484. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, yes, 48 times. But wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, similar to 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 ends with an 8, so does that mean the 48th cycle is 480-488, and 488 is included. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit here is 8. So, each of these blocks has 10 occurrences except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, totaling 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks of 10 and one block of 9 (480-488), totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = **97**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does the 488th page have a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 1 to 484, that's 484 numbers, and 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 times. Wait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (10s) plus any extra. Let me calculate it as floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is not a multiple of 10, I think it's still 48 times. Wait, but when I think of 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 4's in the units place is indeed 48. Let me confirm: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The difference between terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong before. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 occurs in 1-488 in the ones place. So, for each 10 numbers, it occurs once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), does 484 have a 4? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's an additional 4. So total 48 +1=49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such decades there are up to 488. The first is 40-49 (page 40-49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many decades is that? From 40-49: that's one, then each hundred adds another. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 decades. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me count how many times. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference between terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such decades there are up to 488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of that decade. So, how many full decades are there? 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: that's 4 decades. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x10=40. Now, check if 480-488 is included. Since 480-489 would be another decade, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 8 appears 10 times in each full decade, but in the last partial decade, it's 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought of 4 full decades (80-89, etc.), each contributing 10 8's, and then the 480-488 contributing 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 4x10 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought of 4 full decades and the 480-488 as a partial. Let me confirm: 80-89: 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 4x10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is part of the 480s, which is a full decade only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total 4x10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times (no pages in the 800s).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, how many groups of 10 are there in 488? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 8 numbers. So, in 488, the 48th group would end at 480, and the next group (481-490) isn't fully covered because we stop at 488. But in the units place, does 488 have a 4? No, it's 488, so the units digit is 8. So, in the units place, we have 48 occurrences of 4. Wait, but wait, let me check. From 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, so 48 times 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 there. So yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149: second set. 240-249: third set. 340-349: fourth set. 440-449: fifth set. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, so 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial group from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once there. So, total units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the 49th group (481-490), but we only go up to 488, so the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 full ranges (each 10 numbers) and one partial range with 9 numbers. So, that's 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 50 times (from 40-49, 140-149, etc., 5 ranges, each 10 numbers). Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488). So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. Now, for 8's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 49 times. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check the units place for 8's again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th group, from 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. For the tens place, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 8's total 49+49=98. 4's are 187. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 48 times. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 187-98=89. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 488 / 10 = 48.8 groups, so 48 full groups, each contributing one '4'. Since 488 ends with 8, the 49th group (481-490) doesn't add another '4' in the units place. Thus, 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place.

    "text": " Wait, let me check the range. Since the book goes up to 488, the last page is 488, so the units digit 4 would appear in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me calculate how many times that is. The first occurrence is 4, which is 4 = 4 + 10*0. The last occurrence is 484, which is 4 + 10*48. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (since 48*10=480, so 481-488). So, in each full set, the 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481 to 488, does the units digit include a 4? Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Yes, 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, ..., up to 440-449, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, let's see how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each time, the tens digit is 4, so the numbers are from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. So, for each hundreds digit, the 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Let's list the ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers (40-49)\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, so 5 ranges. Wait, but 0 in the hundreds place would be 40-49, which is correct. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last range, 440-449. 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, but let's see. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place. Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, total full sets of 10: 48, as before, so 48 times. Now, the partial set from 481-488: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, the units digit 8 appears in 488. So that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. So, numbers like x80 to x89, where x is the hundreds digit. Let's see how many such ranges are there within 1-488.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-489: but the book ends at 488, so only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488).\n\nWait, so the first four ranges are full (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10. The last range, 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges: 4*10=40, plus 9 in the last partial range, so total 49 times. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 8. So, numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again. For 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total full sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - 48 sets \u00d7 1 = 48 occurrences.\n   - Partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total full sets: 48.\n   - Partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each full range contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Partial range 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book goes up to 488, the last page is 488, so the units place goes up to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last number, so does that mean there's an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 489th number, so maybe I should check if 488 is included. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 in each ten. So, for each ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last group is 480-488, and in that group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is within that group, so that's the 48th 4 in the units place. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each time, it's a block of 100 numbers where the tens digit is 4 for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so we have all these blocks. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, plus 89=187. So, 187 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as for 4's, right? So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. So, units place: 48 times. Wait, but let me check: 488 is included, so the last group is 480-488. The units digits go from 0 to 8, so 488 is included, but 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once in each group of 10, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. So, similar to 4's, the tens digit is 8 for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's. Similarly for 180-189, etc. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place:48, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, that's a big difference. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. For 8's, the hundreds place is 0 because we don't have any page numbers beyond 488, so no 800-899 pages. So, 0 there. Now, in the tens place for 8's, I had 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and then 480-488 contributing 9 8's. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place for 8's: 48 times, same as 4's. So, 48+49=97 8's. So, 187-97=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct because 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 5 blocks. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's, the tens place blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, yeah, I think my calculation is right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something. For example, in the units place, is it 48 or 49? Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, does the last group have a 4 in the units place? Let's see: the last group is 480-488. The units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is in that group, so that's the 48th 4. So, yes, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's, the last group 480-488 has 8 in the units place once (488), so that's included in the 48 units place 8's. So, that's correct. So, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, the number of 8's is 97, so 187-97=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Number of such blocks up to 488: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488: 48.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Number of full blocks contributing 10 8's: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Each contributes 10 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 187\n- Number of 8's: 97\n- **Difference:** 187 - 97 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each full cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's calculate how many such blocks there are up to 488. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. 200-299: 240-249 \u219210. 300-399:340-349\u219210. 400-488:440-449\u219210. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 more in the last partial ten, so 49. Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total units place 8's: 48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so let's check how many full blocks there are.\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u219210 numbers.\n- 100-199:180-189\u219210.\n- 200-299:280-289\u219210.\n- 300-399:380-389\u219210.\n- 400-488:480-488\u21929 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's there. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nWait, but when I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 49 total.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, so 188-98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 1-488, how many 4's in units? Every 10 numbers: 4,14,...,484. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial set: 481-488, which includes 484, so 1 more. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5\u00d710=50.\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488: 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: every 10 numbers, 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each with 1, plus 488, which is the 49th. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks is 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the 4's in the hundreds place, is it correct to count all from 400-488? Yes, because each of those has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, 488-400+1=89, so 89 4's there.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, we have 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. The last partial cycle (481-488) includes another 4, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full cycles, contributing 48 occurrences. The last partial cycle (481-488) includes another 8 (in 488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last page is 488, which is a three-digit number. So, the units place 4's would be from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me figure out how many times that happens. The first occurrence is at 4 and the last is at 484. The difference between 4 and 484 is 480, so dividing by 10 gives 48, but since we include both endpoints, I think it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are. From 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but the 484 is within that group, so actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49 because from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 4, and then 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me calculate it properly. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place there. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 times. Hmm, but wait, starting from 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me count how many numbers that is. The first is 4, and the last is 484. The difference is 484 - 4 = 480, and since each step is 10, the number of terms is 480 / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that suggests 49 times. But earlier I thought 48 because 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Now I'm confused. Let me check with a smaller number. Suppose I have page numbers up to 24. How many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24. That's 3 times. 24 /10 is 2.4, so 2 complete sets, but we have 3 occurrences. So, the formula would be floor((n + 1)/10). Wait, no, maybe it's better to think of it as (n // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each digit position separately. Let me try again. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of times the units digit is 4 from 1 to 488. So, how many numbers between 1 and 488 have 4 as the units digit? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Okay, so that's 49. Now, moving on to the tens place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, total 50 times for the tens place. Now, 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. The total numbers here are 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many times that is. The first is 8, last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's see how many full ranges we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times (in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times (from 400 to 488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times (in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times (since 800-899 exceeds 488).\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 would go up to 484. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 would be at 484. So, that's the 48th set. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 is also included, but in the tens place, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place, not 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers each. So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 1-400, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total is 40+10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial set, 480-488, the units digit 8 is at 488. So, that's the 48th set, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks. From 1-400, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units:48, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number would be the number of tens in 488, which is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens). But wait, in each ten, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each ten has exactly one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit 4 appears in 488? No, 488 has 8 in the units place, so the last 4 in the units place would be in 484, which is the 48th ten. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 1-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the number of tens, which is 48 (since 488/10=48.8). But wait, 488 is included, so does that affect the count? Let me think. The units digit cycles every 10, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Wait, no. Let me check: For example, from 1-10, 8 appears once (at 8). From 11-20, once at 18. So, each ten contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 488 is 48 full tens and then 8 more pages. Wait, no. 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit 8 appears in 48 full tens plus one more in the 49th ten (pages 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 8 appears at 488). So, how many times? It's 48 times from 1-480, and then one more at 488, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. Each ten contributes one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 48 tens, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 187 -98=89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for 8's. Let me recount. Units place 8's: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488/10)=48 full tens, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is 48*10 +8, so the units digit 8 appears at 8,18,...,488. So, that's 49 times, because the first occurrence is at 8 (1st ten), and the last at 488 (49th ten). So, units place 8's:49. Similarly, tens place 8's: as above, 49. So, total 8's:98. 4's:187. So, difference:187-98=89. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\) (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there? Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then a partial block from 481 to 488. Each complete block contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Now, the partial block from 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once here (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me check if I did that right. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, each block of 10 has one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block from 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489: since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the units go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. Yes, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 8's. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit again. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):**\n     - Every 10 numbers contribute one '4' (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - There are 48 complete decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 471-480), each contributing one '4', totaling 48.\n     - The partial decade 481-488 includes 484, adding one more.\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens place:**\n     - '4' appears in the tens place in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n     - Each range contributes 10 '4's, and there are 5 such ranges.\n     - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n     - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n     - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):**\n     - Similar to '4's, every 10 numbers contribute one '8'.\n     - 48 complete decades contribute 48 '8's.\n     - The partial decade 481-488 includes 488, adding one more.\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens place:**\n     - '8' appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n     - The first four ranges each contribute 10 '8's, totaling 40.\n     - The range 480-488 contributes 9 '8's (480-488).\n     - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 '8's.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the last page number with a 4 in the units place before 488. Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since the pages go up to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 within 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, it's 48 full groups. But wait, each group contributes exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. However, wait, page 484 is the last one, which is 484, so that's the 48th occurrence. Hmm, but actually, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49 because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we have 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, but then we also have 484, which is the 48th group, but wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,...,484. Let me count how many numbers that is. The first number is 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms there are, I can take (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term? Let me check: 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, meaning numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total ranges: 5, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. Wait, but let me check the last range: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me count how many terms. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. So, using the formula: last term = 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units place 4's go up to 484. How many 4's are there in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so let me check. The units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit is 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 1-99, there's 40-49, which is one range. Then 100-199, 140-149, another. 200-299, 240-249. 300-399, 340-349. 400-488, 440-449. So that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's included. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8. So, units place 8's: 48. But wait, does 488 count as an extra? Let me check: 488 has an 8 in the units place, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. In 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 488 has an 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th set plus one more. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1-480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is included, which has an 8. So that's one more 8, making it 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so 9 8's in the tens place for 480-488. So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place from 480-488. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens was 49, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 8's: 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. For the tens place, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Wait, but wait, units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. But earlier, when I calculated 4's, I got 187. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go back to the 4's count. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's there, plus the other four ranges of 10 each, totaling 49. That seems right.\n\nUnits place for 8's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 48 full sets (1-480) plus 488, which is the 48th set plus one more, making it 49. So, 49 units place 8's.\n\nSo, yes, 4's:187, 8's:98, difference is 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 fours.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges contributing 4's in the tens place are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 eights.\n   - Page 488 adds one more 8 in the units place.\n   - Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges contributing 8's in the tens place are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each, totaling 40.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have an 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units place goes up to 488. Let me see how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 times. But wait, the 48th group would end at 480, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers, but the units place in 484 would be another 4. So actually, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1 to 480) plus 1 more from 484, making it 49. Wait, no, because 480 is the last number in the 48th group, and the next group is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units place in 484 is another 4. So total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (484) = 49. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it as floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1 more, making it 49. So 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1 more. So total units place 8's: 48+1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So that's 4*10 + 9=40+9=49. So 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct. Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place for 4's. The ranges where the tens digit is 4 are: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges *10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So 4 ranges *10=40, plus 9=49. So that's correct. So the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 up to 488: floor(488/10) = 48.\n   - Since 488 mod 10 = 8 \u2265 4, add 1 more.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Number of such ranges up to 488: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10 up to 488: floor(488/10) = 48.\n   - Since 488 mod 10 = 8, add 1 more.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Number of such ranges up to 488: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - The last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, how many sets of 10 are there? 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times. But wait, does 480 include 480? Yes, but 480's units digit is 0, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually 49 times because 488 is included, but 488's units digit is 8, so 484 is the last one. Wait, no, 488 is page 488, so the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, 484 is page 484, which is within 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's calculate: The first 4 in the units place is 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488 in the ones place. The formula is floor((488 + 1) / 10) * 1, but I think it's better to think as 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th ten, from 481 to 490, but we only go up to 488. So, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 4 in the units place. So, 48 full tens give 48 fours, and then one more in the 481-488 range, making it 49. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so does that affect the count? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) is 48, and then we check if the units digit is >=4 in the remaining part. The remaining part is 488 - (48*10) = 8. So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once in this range, at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the book. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included because we stop at 488. So, let's count how many full sets of 100 we have. From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the tens digit 4 appears in the ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, which is 89 times. Wait, but in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but wait, when I count the hundreds place, I'm counting every number from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1-488? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in the last partial set, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is included. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 800-899 isn't included. Therefore, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188-98 is 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me verify each step.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4's and 8's: 49 each. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89 numbers from 400-488. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 sets of 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full sets of 10 and 9 in the last partial set, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, how many times does this happen? The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. To find the count, I can use the formula: ((last occurrence - first occurrence) / interval) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, so 20 total. 240-249: another 10, total 30. 340-349: another 10, total 40. Now, 440-449: that's another 10, so total 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so all 10 are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. Let's see, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find the count. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. 180-189: another 10, total 20. 280-289: another 10, total 30. 380-389: another 10, total 40. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 8's in the tens place here. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. Total: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now for the 8's: Units place: 49. Tens place: 49. Hundreds: 0. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check the 480-488 range. The tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, I think I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's total: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last number with a 4 in the units place would be 484. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, but since 488 is not a multiple of 10, I need to see how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 times. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with 8, not 4. So, 48 times is correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, since 450-488 would have 5 in the hundreds place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 488 is the last page, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's 49 times. Wait, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each full block (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's. There are four such blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Wait, earlier I thought there are 5 blocks for 4's in the tens place, each contributing 10, so 50. Let me check that again. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. Correct. So, 50 in tens place. For 8's in the tens place, I had 49. Let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total: 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 8's, with an additional 9 from 480-488.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"
