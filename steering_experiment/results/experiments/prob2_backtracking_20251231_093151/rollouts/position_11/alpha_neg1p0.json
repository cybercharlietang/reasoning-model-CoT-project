    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there from 1 to 488? Well, from 1 to 480, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So that's 480 / 10 = 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is 488 // 10 = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's correct. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, yes, 10*4 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Wait, but let me check again. In the tens place, I have 49 8's, and in units, 48. So, total 97 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the 4's count, in the hundreds place, I had 89 numbers from 400 to 488. But when counting the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, each contributing 10. So, 5*10=50. That seems correct. Units place: 48. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units place: 48, tens place: 49, hundreds:0, total 97. So, 187-97=90. Wait, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and then 9 in the last partial decade. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of times 4 appears in each set of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. So, in 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. In 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many hundreds do we have? 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in each set of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 8, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480, 481, ..., 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's 1 more, total 49. Tens place: Each hundred has a 40-49 range, which is 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 sets. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 48 full sets, 48, plus 488, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49 +49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488: does that include 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, correct. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 is correct. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. 4's:188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10 and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). Each set contributes 1, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each range contributes 10. There are 5 such ranges (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). Each set contributes 1, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each range contributes 10, except 480-488, which contributes 9. Total = 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and take the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group goes up to 488, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then 488 is in the next group. So, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (since 488 is the 48th group times 10 plus 8). Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), and 340-349 (another 10). The next would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? 440 is less than 488, and 449 is also less than 488. So that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. But wait, is 440-449 fully within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to page 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, 488 is the 48th group plus 8, so the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number is in the next decade. Wait, let me think again. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in each group of 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the last group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in each group of 10, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 groups, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 count as an extra? Because 488 is in the 48th group (481-490), so the units digit 8 appears once in each group, so 48 times. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many such ranges there are. First, 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Then 180-189: another 10. Then 280-289: another 10. Then 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus the partial range 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, total number of 8's is 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full groups).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times (5 ranges \u00d7 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many times this happens, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488, which is another 8 numbers. In this last partial group, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 would be up to 449, but the book goes up to 488. So, does 440-449 fit entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if the last block ends before 488. 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's count how many numbers are from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times this occurs. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, 488 is part of this group, and it's the units digit. So, that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each full block contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. Let's count the full blocks first: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each with 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1 to 480).\n   - Last partial group (481-488) contributes 1 more (484).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Number of such blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1 to 480).\n   - Last partial group (481-488) contributes 1 more (488).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Each contributes 10 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last block (480-488) contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full groups, and then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). But since 488 is the last page, the units digit 4 appears in 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Wait, no, the units digit 4 is only in 484. So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 488 // 10 = 48 times, but wait, 488 is the last number, so 488 /10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, so 480 is included, and then 481-488 is the next group. So, in the units place, from 1-480, there are 48 4's, and then 484 is another 4 in the units place, so total 49 times. Wait, that makes sense because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 4's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, we have four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears in 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in 1-99, 140-149 in 100-199, etc.). So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 numbers = 40 times. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fully included, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 +1 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last number, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 4 hundreds \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (from 1 to 488).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds, 10 in 440-449).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (40 in the first four hundreds, 9 in 480-488).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to figure out how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the 48th group would end at 480, and then 481 to 488 is the 49th group. But in this group, 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th occurrence in the units place. Let me think again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the numbers ending with 4 would be 484, which is one more. So, total 49 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is beyond 480, we have an extra 4 in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, moving on to the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't because 540 is beyond 488. So, let's count how many full decades we have where the tens digit is 4. Each such decade has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. From 240-249: another 10. From 340-349: another 10. From 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, no. Wait, 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, let me add up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last group, 488 is the number where 8 is in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Wait, 488 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28,..., 488. From 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Because 488 is the 49th term. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of 8's in the units place is the number of numbers from 1 to 488 that end with 8. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of such numbers is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many full decades where the tens digit is 8. Each decade contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers. From 180-189: 10. From 280-289:10. From 380-389:10. From 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (every 10 numbers, including 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (every 10 numbers, including 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times (80-89, 180-189, etc., plus 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. However, in the 480th decade (480-489), the last number is 488, so 488 is included. So, in the units place, there are 48 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such decades are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five decades. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so does that mean there's an extra 8? Let me check: 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's included in the 48th group. Wait, no: 48 groups would go up to 480, and then 488 is in the next group, which would be the 49th group, but since we're only going up to 488, the 49th group is incomplete. Wait, no: 488 is the 488th page, so the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of 4's, which is 48, because 488 is included. Wait, no: Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades plus any extra in the incomplete decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, and in the incomplete decade (480-488), the 8 in the units place occurs once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but earlier for 4's, I thought it was 48 because 488 is included. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. For 4's in units place: from 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? It's the number of times 4 appears as the units digit. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 occurrences. So, I think I was wrong earlier about the 4's. For 4's in units place, it's 48, but for 8's, it's 49. Let me confirm: 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and in the incomplete decade (480-488), the 484 is the last 4 in units place, so 48 times. For 8's, the incomplete decade includes 488, so that's an extra 8, making it 49. So, units place: 48 for 4's, 49 for 8's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last decade is 480-488. So, how many such decades are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five decades. Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, but 489 isn't included). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. But the tens digit is 8 in all of these, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 decades with 10 each, and one with 9. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would occur in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, going back to 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, plus 89=187. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such decades, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 such decades, with the last being 480-488 (9 numbers). Total = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, and then a partial cycle. In each full cycle, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the last partial cycle is from 481 to 488. In this, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. That's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, if I take 488 divided by 10, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the 4th number in that partial cycle. So, that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full tens and a remainder of 8. So, each full ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included. So, that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial cycle. So, yes, 484 is included, so that's one more. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 +1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let me check that again because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. The tens place: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 total 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, same as 4's in units place. Hmm.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) has only 9. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. That would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct, 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one range of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nUnits place of 4's: every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing a 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more. So, 49.\n\nTotal 4's: 89 +50 +49=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is a high number, so maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. So, same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm including page 0 or not. But page numbers start at 1, so 0 isn't included. So, in the tens place, for example, 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, but does that include page 40? Yes, because pages start at 1. So, 40 is page 40, which is valid. Similarly, 80 is page 80, which is valid.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me try a smaller example to test my method.\n\nSuppose the book has 28 pages. Let's count 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers:1-28.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24 \u2192 3.\n\nTens:40-49, but since we only go up to 28, no tens place 4's.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal 4's:3.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28 \u21923.\n\nTens:80-89, but only up to 28, so none.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal 8's:3.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place 4's:28/10=2.8, so 2 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 2. Then, in the last partial cycle (21-28), units digits go up to 8, so 24 is included. So, 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nTens place 4's: from 40-49, but only up to 28, so none. So, 0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 4's:3.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:28/10=2.8, so 2 full cycles, 8,18. Then, in the last partial cycle (21-28), units digits go up to 8, so 28 is included. So, 2+1=3.\n\nTens place 8's:80-89, but only up to 28, so none.\n\nTotal 8's:3.\n\nDifference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 84 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84 \u21929.\n\nTens:40-49,140-149,... but up to 84, so only 40-49 and 140-149 would be beyond 84, so only 40-49:10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 40-49 is within 1-84, so 10 numbers.\n\nHundreds: none.\n\nTotal 4's:9+10=19.\n\nWait, but wait, 44 is in both units and tens place. But when counting digits, each occurrence is counted separately. So, 44 has two 4's, so both are counted.\n\nWait, but in my method above, I'm counting each digit place separately, so 44 would contribute to both units and tens place counts.\n\nSo, in the case of 84 pages, units place 4's: from 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84 \u21929 numbers.\n\nTens place 4's:40-49:10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's:9+10=19.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78 \u21928 numbers (since 88 is beyond 84).\n\nTens:80-89, but up to 84, so 80-84:5 numbers.\n\nTotal 8's:8+5=13.\n\nDifference:19-13=6.\n\nWait, let me count manually.\n\nPage numbers 1-84.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84 \u21929.\n\nTens:40-49:10.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal:19.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78 \u21928.\n\nTens:80,81,82,83,84 \u21925.\n\nTotal:13.\n\nDifference:6. So, according to my method, that's correct.\n\nSo, applying the same method to 488 pages, I get 188 4's and 98 8's, difference 90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as 800-899 exceeds 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a page, I take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The first 4 is at 4, and the last one is at 484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1, 2, 3, or 4. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid as 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. The first number is 400, and the last is 488. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But let me check the exact count. The first 8 is at 8, the last is at 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many sets. The hundreds digit can be 0 (80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389). So that's 4 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 4 *10 = 40. But wait, the last set is 380-389, which is valid as 389 < 488. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n   - 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, I can calculate how many full groups of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial group. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Actually, each full group of 10 contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, which is 48 groups of 10, that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the 4 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 450-488 is beyond that. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds are there? From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, that's 488 numbers, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. So that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is included. So, each hundred block contributes 10 times. How many hundreds? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, etc., which is 10 times each. So, 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total for tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 50 times. Let me recount. For the tens place of 4's: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last block (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last block, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. Units place: 49 for both 4's and 8's. So, 4's total: 188, 8's total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 such occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 such occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last number in the units place with 4 in the range is 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me calculate how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's check each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the counts again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. However, wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 488th page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th group. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The last one is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, so 48 numbers. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, yes. 140-149 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449, which is the fifth set. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last one is 488, which ends with 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, let me think: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, which is 8, then 18 is 18, and so on. The last one is 488. So, how many terms are there? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference is 10. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's check how many sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me count: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4 (since 400-488). So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 itself have a units digit of 4? No, it ends with 8. So, the last occurrence of 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, from 0-99, there's one (40-49), then 100-199 another (140-149), 200-299 another (240-249), 300-399 another (340-349), and 400-488 another (440-449). So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This would be from 400 to 488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 itself ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first one is 8, which is 1\u00d78, then 2\u00d78=16, but wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The last such number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 8 \u00d7 61, but wait, that's not the right way. Wait, each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th block starts at 480, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many such ranges? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 4 (400-488) and 0-3 (1-399). So, does any page number have 8 in the hundreds place? No, because the maximum is 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at most. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct.

To find the count, I can use the formula: ((Last - First) / Difference) + 1. Here, Last is 484, First is 4, Difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but let me check if 484 is within 488. Yes, 484 is less than 488, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10\u00d74 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 numbers, with 5 blocks total.  \n   Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers from 800-899 exist, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " To find how many such numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last number with a 4 in the units place before 488 is 484, which is within 488. So, that gives 48 instances. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 instances. Wait, but 440-449 goes up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 instances in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 instances. Now, adding up the 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, there are 187 4's printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last such number is 488, which is included, so 48 instances. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 instances. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 instances. Wait, does 488 include a block beyond 380-389? The next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 part is included. So, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me check: from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, I need to add these 9 instances to the previous 40. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because I initially thought of 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the 480-488 adds 9 more. So total is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with an 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 instances here. Now, adding up the 8's: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97. Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48, tens place: 49, so total 97 8's. Wait, earlier I thought the tens place had 40 from the blocks and 9 from 480-488, making 49. That seems correct. So, total 8's are 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total instances = \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   Number of such blocks = 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Each block contributes 10 instances, so total instances = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.  \n   Total instances = 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total instances = \u230a488 / 10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389) and in the range 480-488.  \n   - Blocks: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 instances.  \n     Total from blocks = 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - Additional instances from 480-488: 9 instances (480, 481, ..., 488).  \n   Total instances = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   Total instances = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.**\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. To calculate this, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Since we're only interested in complete groups, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 fall within 488? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, that gives 48 occurrences. But wait, actually, when you divide 488 by 10, you get 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But 490 is beyond 488, so the last complete decade is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within 488. So, that's 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, from 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks contribute 5\u00d710=50 times. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so all 10 numbers are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have a 4 starting from page 400 up to 488. So, numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades. But wait, 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, that's 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4), and 480-488 (5). Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, but the last block has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the tens place, each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\)  \n     (484 is within 488, so all 48 are valid.)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so:  \n     \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\)  \n     (488 is included, so all 48 are valid.)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (480-488).  \n   - Total:  \n     \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 \\).\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in 488. Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if 488 is included. The last 4 in the units place would be 484, right? Because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the next number after 484 would be 494, but 494 is beyond 488. So, yes, 48 times is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances where 4 is in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, and the next block would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many blocks are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 blocks are included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1 (since both endpoints are included). 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. So, 48 times 8 appears in the units place. Wait, but let me check the last one: 488 is included, so 488 is the last one. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8. Each block of 10 numbers (like 80-89) contributes 10 instances where 8 is in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, this block only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), because 488 is the last page. Wait, no: 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers, not 10. So, let me correct that. The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. The fifth block is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me make sure. The 480-488 range: from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, yes, 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. When I was counting the tens place for 8, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but each of those numbers has 8 in the tens place. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, the total 8's in the tens place is 49. So, 48 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 97. For 4's, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89, total 187. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 such numbers (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 48 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last number in the units place with 4 before 488 would be 484. To find how many terms there are, I can subtract 4 from 484, which gives me 480, then divide by 10 to get 48. Adding 1 gives me 49. So, there are 49 numbers where 4 appears in the units place. Wait, let me check that again. If I take 484 - 4 = 480, then 480 / 10 = 48, so 48 intervals, meaning 49 numbers. Yeah, that seems right. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has another set. So, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of ten, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 is correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, there are 89 numbers where 4 is in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4 in the hundreds place. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count: (488 - 8) / 10 = 480 / 10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489: 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets of ten? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, let me check: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, the tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, in the hundreds place, 8 appears only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. To calculate this, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each group of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10. Each group contributes one 4, so that's 48 4's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first one is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent hundred (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has another 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: 10 numbers. From 240-249: 10 numbers. From 340-349: 10 numbers. From 440-449: 10 numbers. That's a total of 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? The last multiple of 10 is 480, so 480/10=48. So, 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. The first range is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: this is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, let me check: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, does 488 include 484? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149, another set. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets is that? Let me see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. The last one is 488, which is included. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within 488. Yes, up to 488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, and then 480-488, which contributes 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 or lower. The hundreds digit 8 would start at 800, but 800 is beyond 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.

So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that?

So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many groups of 10 are there up to 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place, and then 488 itself is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So that's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 times, but the last range, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four ranges: 4*10 = 40. The last range: 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, I should check if 488 is included. The last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488, so yes, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 8, 18, ..., 488: from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, up to 488, how many such ranges are there? 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's four sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 times. But wait, does 380-389 come before 488? Yes, 389 is less than 488, so that's correct. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 98. So, there are 98 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full decades, and then see how many 4's are in each. Wait, no, actually, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, but 484 is within that block. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 49 because from 4 to 484, that's 49 times (since 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers). Wait, let me check: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yeah, that makes sense. So units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, 449 is within that range, so yes, that block is complete. So tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is the first digit. A 4 in the hundreds place would be from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So how many such numbers are there? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 488. So the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89, that's one block. 100-199: 180-189, another. 200-299: 280-289, another. 300-399: 380-389, another. Now, 400-488: the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, for the hundreds place, how many blocks? From 0-399, we have four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the counts again. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each, which seems correct because from 1 to 488, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is the same as the number of times it appears in each position, except for the last digit if it doesn't complete a full block. But in this case, both 4 and 8 in the units place have 49 occurrences because 488 is included. Wait, let me check that again. For units place, the count is (last occurrence - first occurrence)/step +1. For 4's, last occurrence is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1). So n= (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Similarly for 8's, last occurrence is 488. So (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Now, hundreds place: 4's occur from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's don't occur in hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so no 800-899 pages. So that's correct. So total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full blocks and one partial block (480-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) in 488, plus any extra if the last partial decade includes a 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last partial decade is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's another 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 4's in the units place is the integer part, 48, plus 1 if 488 >= 484. Since 484 is within 480-488, yes, so 49. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, but I think 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), from 100-199: 140-149 (10), from 200-299: 240-249 (10), from 300-399: 340-349 (10), and from 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That's when the page number is between 400-488. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. The last partial decade is 480-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. These occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, the highest page number is 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's 98 8's. But let me check the tens place again. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place for that block. So, yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, 50. That seems correct. Units place: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. For 8's: units place, same logic: 8, 18, ..., 488. 488 is included, so 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number. Let me try a smaller example to see if my method works. Suppose the book has 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. Counting 4's: units place: 4,14 => 2. Tens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so no 4's in tens place. Hundreds place: none. So total 4's: 2. 8's: units place: 8,18 => 2. Tens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so no 8's in tens place. So total 8's: 2. Difference: 0. Now, using my method: For 4's, units: 20//10=2, and since 20 >= 4, add 1 if 20 >= 4 +10*(n-1). Wait, maybe my method isn't perfect for smaller numbers. Alternatively, maybe it's better to stick with the initial method. But in the case of 20 pages, 4's and 8's are equal, so the difference is 0, which makes sense. Let me try another example: 50 pages. 4's: units place: 4,14,24,34,44 => 5. Tens place: 40-49 => 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Hundreds place: none. Total 4's: 5 +10=15. 8's: units place:8,18,28,38,48 =>5. Tens place: 40-49 includes 48, but 80-89 is beyond 50, so no 8's in tens place. So, total 8's:5. Difference:15-5=10. Let me count manually: pages 4,8,14,18,24,28,34,38,44,48. Wait, that's 10 pages with 4's and 5 pages with 8's. Wait, but 4's: in units place, 4,14,24,34,44: 5. In tens place, 40-49: each has a 4 in tens place, so 10 pages, but each page number has one 4, so 10 4's. So total 4's:5+10=15. 8's: units place:8,18,28,38,48:5. Tens place: none, since 80-89 is beyond 50. So, total 8's:5. So difference:10. So my method works here. So, going back to the original problem, the difference is 90. Therefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group would be 480-488, which includes 484 as the last 4 in the units place. So, actually, there are 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's another 10. So, how many ranges? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but only the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 480,481,...,488, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but actually, 480 has tens digit 8, but 481-488 also have tens digit 8, right? Wait, no, 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8. 481 is 4 8 1, so tens digit is 8. Similarly up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive), but wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, that seems correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I counted 49. Let me see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. That seems correct. So, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book ends at 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 numbers.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last number in the units place with 4 is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, n = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so I don't need to consider that. Let's calculate how many sets of 100 there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, no. The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400 to 499, but since we're only going up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Common difference is 10. So, n = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's calculate how many sets. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 98 8's? Wait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49, and the tens place had 49, so total 98. But wait, let me confirm the tens place count again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I had 188 4's. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Total 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place in 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, does 488 count as having a hundreds digit of 4? Yes, because 488 is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, yes, it's included.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 includes 480, which is 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, 0 in units. So, 480 is included, and 488 is included. So, that's 9 numbers.\n\nI think my counts are correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers there are. Since the last page is 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, starting from 4, every 10th number has a 4 in the units place. How many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count each of these blocks. - 40-49: That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: Another 10 numbers, so another 10 4's. - 240-249: Another 10. - 340-349: Another 10. - 440-449: But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. That's another 10. So, total in the tens place: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last 8 in the units place is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find the number of terms. First term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference is 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these blocks contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8's in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers are there from 1 to 488. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can subtract 4 from 484 and divide by 10, then add 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. To find the number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8. Let me check: 480 has tens digit 8, 481, ..., up to 488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, let's count the ranges: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and 1 range with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete set. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra numbers. In each complete decade, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. Does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is included, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the 40-49 block, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, another 10. 280-289: yes, another 10. 380-389: yes, another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, so in the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit 8 appears from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9, so 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10, total 20. 280-289: another 10, total 30. 380-389: another 10, total 40. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, so total 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. For the units place, I had 49, which seems correct. For the tens place, I had 49 as well. So, total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nWait, when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. But let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I considered 4 blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but when counting the 8's in the units place, I had 48 complete decades and one extra, so 49. Similarly, the 4's in the units place were 49 as well. So, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. I said 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct because 440-449 is within 488.\n\nSo, 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 90 more 4's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each decade, '4' appears once in the units place, totaling 48. In the extra numbers, '4' appears once (484), so total 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 such blocks up to 440-449, each contributing 10 instances, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra numbers. In each decade, '8' appears once, totaling 48. In the extra numbers, '8' appears once (488), so total 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete blocks contributing 10 each, and the last partial block 480-488 contributes 9 instances. Total 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place would be the total number of times 4 appears in that position. Let's see, every 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last number, so 488 is included. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, no, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 48 times, but 484 is the 49th number. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which is 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then checking if the remainder includes another 4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, the units place 4's are 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such decades there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one decade. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another decade. So, that's 5 decades. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 488 is beyond that. So, 5 decades, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, 488 is 488, so 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, the units place has 49 8's. Wait, let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, common difference is 10. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's count how many such decades. From 1-99: 80-89 is one decade, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 4 decades with 10 each, plus 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 times. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be zero, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so yes, 0 times. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. I said 5 decades: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full decades (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place: 4's had 48, but wait, earlier I thought 488 is the last number, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so 488 is the 49th occurrence for 8's, but for 4's, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 484 is 48*10 +4, so it's the 49th number where the units digit is 4. So, units place for 4's: 484 is the 49th occurrence, so 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so 484 is the 49th. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. For the units place of 4's: the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 =488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, both 4's and 8's in the units place occur 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, but that's incorrect. It's actually 49. So, let me correct that. So, 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 8's: 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by miscalculating the units place for 4's. Let me go through it again. For 4's in units place: numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The last number is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1). So, 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8+10*(n-1)=488 \u2192 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. So, correcting the earlier mistake, 4's in units place are 49, not 48. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check again. For 4's in units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The first term a=4, common difference d=10, last term l=484. The nth term is a + (n-1)d = l. So, 4 + (n-1)*10=484 \u2192 (n-1)*10=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. a=8, d=10, l=488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10=488 \u2192 (n-1)*10=480 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms. So, yes, 49 each. Therefore, 4's total: 49+50+89=188. 8's total:49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th term in this sequence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each decade contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such decades.  \n   Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The 4 appears in numbers 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th term in this sequence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four decades contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group might not be complete. The last page is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, then 140-149, another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But wait, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 0-99), 1,2,3,4. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit 4 can go up to 449, since 488 is the last page. So, for hundreds digit 0: 40-49: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 1: 140-149: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 2: 240-249: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 3: 340-349: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 4: 440-449: 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Let's count how many such ranges. For hundreds digit 0: 80-89: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 1: 180-189: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 2: 280-289: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 3: 380-389: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 4: 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 times. Wait, but let me double-check. From 0-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187-97=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:48, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 8's, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. From 0-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total is 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in tens place, 48 in units, total 97. So, the difference is 187-97=90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me verify: 488-400+1=89. Yes, correct. So, that's 89. So, total 4's: 48+50+89=187. 8's:48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can never be 8, so that's correct. So, I think my calculation is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, which is 488, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, how many numbers ending with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So actually, there are 49 times the 8 appears in the units place. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: I thought 49, but let me recount. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units:49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total 8's:49+49=98. So 187-98=89. So the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,...,484.

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), there's a 4 in 484. So, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, actually, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, the total number is the number of times 4 appears in the units place across all page numbers. The formula is usually floor((n - digit)/10) + 1 if the last digit is >= digit. Hmm, maybe a better way is to calculate it as follows: The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last partial block (481-488), there's one more 4 in 484. So, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but actually, in each block of 10, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears exactly once in each block. So, 48 full blocks give 48 4's, and the last partial block (481-488) has one more 4 (484). So, 48 +1 =49. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, let's count how many such decades there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 *10 =50 4's. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, all 5 sets are complete. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and the last partial block (481-488) has one more 8 in 488. So, 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial decade because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers.

Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these: - 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last number in that range is 488. So, 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only be 4, so 8 cannot appear in the hundreds place here because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many such numbers are there? From 4 to 484, each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. The total number of blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. However, the last block might not be complete. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last block is 480-488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. But wait, let me check: the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, that's different. So, there are 49 4's in the units place because 484 is the 49th term. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has one set of 10 numbers with the tens digit as 4. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, 5 hundreds in total? Wait, no, 0-99 is the first hundred, then 100-199 is the second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 is the fifth, but it's not a full hundred. But for the tens place, each full hundred contributes 10 numbers. So, up to 399, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I'm overcounting because I'm considering each digit separately. Actually, for the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 numbers, except the last one which might be partial. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. From 100-199:180-189\u219210. From 200-299:280-289\u219210. From 300-399:380-389\u219210. From 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which comes from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50, but in the initial calculation, I thought it was 50, but then I thought maybe 40? Wait, no, it's 5 sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, that's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, units=49, tens=49, total=98. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Number of such ranges: 5 (from 0-99 to 400-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full range (except the last) contributes 10 numbers.\n   - Number of full ranges: 4 (from 0-99 to 300-399).\n   - Last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers exist up to 488. The first number with 4 in the units place is 4, and the last is 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: (Last term - First term) / Common difference + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full ranges we have. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 numbers because 449 is within 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. However, wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, another 10. - 200-299: 280-289, another 10. - 300-399: 380-389, another 10. - 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But actually, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, but we take the integer part, 48). Wait, but 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 times 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th 4 in the units place would be at 484, right? Because 484 is 48*10 + 4. Then 494 would be beyond 488, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but the last block is 400-488, which isn't a full hundred. Let me check how many full hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then the partial hundred from 400-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the partial hundred from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the partial hundred 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units:48, tens:49. Total 97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 0-399, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, and then 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40+10=50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. Correct. Units place for 4's: 488/10=48.8, so 48 times. Correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 pages (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many such numbers are there? Well, the first 4 is at 4, and the last one before 488 would be 484. To find how many there are, I can take 484, subtract 4, and then divide by 10, then add 1. That would be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. But 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many blocks are there? Well, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449. Now, does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is within 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's from 400 up to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0 (80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389). That's 4 blocks. Each block is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, does 480-489 exist? Well, the book has 488 pages, so 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place, right? So, that's 9 numbers. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. I considered only up to 380-389, which is correct, but 480-488 also has 8 in the tens place. So, that's an additional 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's would be 4 blocks *10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4*10=40. Then 480-488: 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " I need to find how many such numbers there are. The first number is 4, and the last number is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the count, I can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. Here, last is 484, first is 4, step is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, and then 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. Let me calculate how many complete groups of 100 there are. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, and then 480-488: which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., 488. So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and in 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total in the tens place is 10 + 9 = 19. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10. From 200-299: 240-249: 10. From 300-399: 340-349: 10. From 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's not 4. Wait, no, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, so the 4's in the tens place only go up to 449. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50. Wait, but 400-449 is 50 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the total is 10 for each hundred, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the total tens place 4's are 10 * 4 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10 (from 400-449), totaling 50. Wait, but 400-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 10 * 5 = 50. Hmm, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. Using the formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10. From 200-299: 280-289: 10. From 300-399: 380-389: 10. From 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 188. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49, Hundreds: 0. Total: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

This gives 49 numbers.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, I should check if the last page number 488 includes 488 as a page, so 488 is included, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so 488 is included. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but wait, the last block is from 440-449, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, let's count the blocks. First four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's printed: 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's. Units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units:48, tens:49. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. So, 97 8's. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but wait a second, let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Correct. And for 8's, the hundreds place is 0. So, that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Occurrences: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of complete blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Each contributes 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial block: 480-488 (9 numbers).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"
