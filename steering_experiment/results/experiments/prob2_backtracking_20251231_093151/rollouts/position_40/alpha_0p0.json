So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many sets? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many sets. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, does 480-488 have 9 numbers? Let me see: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For the eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 full blocks (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total 49+49=98. Hmm, but earlier I thought maybe I missed something. Wait, let me recount the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total 49+49=98 eights. Wait, but wait, in the hundreds place, there's no 8, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Correct. And for the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check again for the tens place in eights. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Hmm, but let me check the tens place again because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in each of those, so 9 eights there. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 =90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds one, so 8,18,...,488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. I said that 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. That's correct. And units place is 49 because from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 units and 49 tens, totaling 98 eights. Fours are 188, so 188-98=90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. Let me verify the hundreds place for fours: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 sets (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights: units place, same logic, 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, the last set has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So, total eights are 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

    "text": " Let's see how many there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count how many full sets and partial sets there are. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, which occurs 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, no, because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so it's the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many 8's in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, but 489 isn't included). So that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " How many such numbers? The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). Wait, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. So, for the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total 98 eights. And 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I might have made a mistake earlier when I thought the answer was 90, but let me confirm again. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, I had 89 fours, which seems correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. And in the tens place for fours, I had 50, which is from 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place for fours: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours. For fours in the tens place, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. And for eights in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.

Correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. So, same as fours, 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct.

Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks up to 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count each block. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).

So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, 484 is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Similarly, units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. Hundreds place for eights: none, correct.

That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units place: from 8,18,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, which is the 49th term because (488-8)/10=48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Hundreds place: none, since 800+ is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, then every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count as a units digit 8? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers except maybe the last one. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me confirm. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: Units place: 49. Tens place:50. Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. Checking eights: Units place:49. Tens place:49. Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last one (480-488), which has 9.\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me check: 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place 8, but only up to 488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again. **Fours:**\n- Units: From 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.

So, 10*4 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: none, so 0.\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.
