    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's are in the units place? From 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so the 48th set is 480-488, and 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, actually, it's 49 eights in the units place. Let me confirm: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which is 9 numbers (480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, how many eights in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last block has 9 terms, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see how many 8's are in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, that's only up to 488. So, let's see: Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Wait, in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for 0-99: 80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Wait, but in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So, adding up, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, so 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10, except 440-449, which is within 488.  \n   Total: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   Each block contributes 10, except 480-488, which has 9.  \n   Total: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets each contribute 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's correct because 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, total 98. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Let me consider each digit position separately again.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in the 49th cycle (484). So, 49 fours.\n\n- For 8's: similarly, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in the 49th cycle (488). So, 49 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 fours and 49 eights, which adds up correctly. Then, in the tens place, for 4's, we had 50 fours, and for 8's, 49 eights. So, total fours:49+50+89=188, eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.

    "text": " Let's see, the last page is 488, which ends with an 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place would be the number of times 8 appears as the last digit from 1 to 488. So, how many times does this happen? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, the total count is the number of times 8 appears in the units place. Since every 10 numbers have one 8, the number of such occurrences is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 when counting from 0. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. From 80-89: 10 eights, correct. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 49 fours. Tens place:50 fours. Hundreds place:89 fours. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: Units:49, Tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, yes, 188 fours. For the eights, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98.

    "text": " Let's see, the first 8 is at 8, and the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The numbers go from 8 to 488 in steps of 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, for the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that's 98 eights. But let me check again. Units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40, and then 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, 40+9=49 in the tens place. Units place:49. So, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place, I had 49. Let me recount. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4,14,...,484. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. Last is 484, first is 4, step is 10. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 sets. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place, every 10 numbers starting at 8,18,...,488. So, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me think again. Did I miss any numbers? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is correct. For 8's, hundreds place is zero, correct. Units and tens places seem correctly counted. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes, because it's within the book. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: The first 8 is at page 8, then every 10 pages after that. So, the last one would be 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That's (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, how many sets of 10 are there? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens place 8's would be: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488). So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I counted the tens place, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's. I said 49 fours, but let me see: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in the units place, from 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for fours, I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSo, all counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on. The last one would be 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 10. The nth term is given by a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. We can set a_n \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u2192 n-1 \u2264 48 \u2192 n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 terms. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, did I make a mistake anywhere? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I did it right.

Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block which might be cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but 80-89 is in the first 100 pages, right? So, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (including 8 and 488). Wait, but 488 is 488, so does that count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term in this sequence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, adding up: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, the tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 4 blocks (400-499, but our book ends at 488, so up to 440-449). Wait, actually, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Let's see, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The total number of such numbers is the number of times 8 appears in the units place. Since 488 is the last page, let's compute how many tens are there. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, the number of terms is 49 (since starting from 0: 0*10+8=8 up to 48*10+8=488). So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let's see, the last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. How many times? So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49 eights. So, total eights:98. So, 188-98=90.

The first occurrence is at 8, the next at 18, and so on until 488. To find how many numbers, I can take 488 and subtract 8, then divide by 10 and add 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. But in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full hundreds are there before 400? From 1-400, there are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each has a set of 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so that's 4 sets *10 =40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Yes, that adds up to 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

If I take 488 and divide by 10, I get 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Because 8 is at 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place except possibly the last block. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and one block of 9.

Wait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting, especially in the units and tens places. Let me recount the fours and eights separately to ensure I didn't overcount or undercount. For fours: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Using the same formula: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90.

Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40 numbers) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9.

For the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now for the eights: units place, 8 to 488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Therefore, 188 - 98 = 90.

The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block, 480-488, has only 9. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 such numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
