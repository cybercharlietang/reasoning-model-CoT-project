    "text": " How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, 9. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place for numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1), so there are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place for numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers). So, 10 +10+10+10+9=49.

Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.

And for the units place, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98 eights. For fours, units:49, tens:50 (since 440-449 is included, which is 10 numbers), and hundreds:89 (from 400-488). 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 in the last partial block. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me list them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems right. For eights, in the tens place, we have 49, which includes up to 488. Wait, when we count 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. Units place: 49, which is 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th number. Wait, 488 is the last page, so yes, units place has 49 eights. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except maybe the last few numbers. Since 488 is the last page, the units digits go up to 8. So, for units place, each digit from 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, but since 488 is 48*10 +8, the digits 0-8 appear 49 times, and 9 appears 48 times. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for units digits, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in each block of 100, and then in the remaining 88 numbers (since 488 is 4*100 + 88), the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, digits 0-8 appear one more time, making it 49 times, and 9 appears 48 times. So, for units place, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times. That matches my earlier count. For tens place: Similarly, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for 488, which is 4*100 + 88, the tens digit cycles 4 full times (0-9) in each hundred, and then in the last 88 numbers, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 48*10 +8). So, in the tens place, each digit 0-8 appears 5 times (4 full hundreds and once in the last 88), and digits 9 appears 4 times. Wait, no, let me think again. For the tens digit, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 00-09, 10-19,...,90-99). So, for 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In the full hundreds, each digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 9 times (since 488 is 48*10 +8). Wait, no. Let me list them:\n\n401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n...\n480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the last one (8) only has 9 numbers. So, for tens digits in 401-488:\n\nDigits 0-7: each appears 10 times (since 401-410, 411-420,...,470-479)\nDigit 8: appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, for 401-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens digits:\n\nFrom 1-400: each digit 0-9 appears 40 times (4 hundreds * 10 per hundred)\nFrom 401-488: digits 0-7: 10 each, digit 8:9.\n\nSo, total for each digit:\n\nDigits 0-7: 40 +10=50\nDigit 8:40 +9=49\nDigit 9:40 (since there's no 9 in 401-488 tens place)\n\nWait, but the problem is only up to 488, so the tens digit 9 doesn't appear at all beyond 400. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times (since 4 is one of 0-7), and 8 appears 49 times. Wait, no, 4 is in 0-7? Wait, 4 is a digit, yes, it's included in 0-9. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, and digit 8 appears 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times (from 40-49, etc.), but now I'm getting a different count. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When I'm counting the tens place, I should consider all page numbers from 1 to 488. So, for the tens digit being 4, that occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, totaling 50 fours. That matches my initial count. But according to the other method, from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, and from 401-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times. So, for digit 4, in 1-400, it's 40 times, and in 401-488, it's 10 times (since 401-410, etc.), so total 50. That's consistent. Similarly, digit 8 in the tens place: from 1-400, it's 40 times, and from 401-488, it's 9 times, so total 49. So, that's correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488 and 0-3 for lower numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense.\n\nTotal pages:488. Each page has a number, so the total number of digits is:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 9 numbers, 1 digit each: 9 digits\n- Pages 10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each: 180 digits\n- Pages 100-488: 389 numbers, 3 digits each: 1167 digits\nTotal digits:9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98, so total counted digits are 188 + 98 = 286. The rest are other digits. But I don't think that helps me directly, but it's good to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, digits 0-8 appear one more time, so 49 times each, and 9 appears 48 times.\n\nSo, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488, which is 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and 88 extra pages.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times per digit.\n\nIn the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For each tens digit 0-8, how many times do they appear?\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- ...\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488) =50\n- Digit 8:40 +9=49\n- Digit 9:40 (only from 1-400, as there's no 9 in 401-488 tens place)\n\nSo, tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no counts.\n- Pages 100-399: hundreds digit is 1,2,3. So, digit 4 appears 0 times here.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so digit 4 appears 89 times (since 488-400+1=89).\n- Digit 8 never appears in hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n- 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 488 is included, so units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me verify. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Specifically, in the 480-488 range, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488, and the other sets (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 each. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is indeed 49. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units, total 98. And for fours, 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is up to 489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block which only goes up to 488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 5 sets, but the last set has 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Wait, but I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, that's 9, but the other sets are 10 each. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 in tens place. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. Hmm, but wait, when I counted units, I included 488 as the last number, which is correct. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's in the units place. Let me recount the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? They are 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms, the formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, for the eights:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach to count the digits.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears is calculated based on higher digits and the current digit.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to do it as I did before, but let me try this method.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, for numbers 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place. So, 48 each, but wait, the last block is incomplete (481-488), which has 8 numbers. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each block, so 48 times from complete blocks, plus check if 484 is within the last block. 484 is 48*10 +4, which is within the 480-488 range, so that's the 49th occurrence. Similarly, 8 appears in 8,18,...,488, which is 49 times. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial block (400-488). So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), 8 ten times (80-89). So, for each complete hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, the partial block 400-488: the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 (10 numbers), 8 for 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place: fours=40+10=50, eights=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor the hundreds digit, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. 8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book only has 488 pages. So, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So, I think 90 is the correct answer. But I'm a bit surprised because I thought maybe the difference would be smaller, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right because each of those numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit.\n\nAnd for the eights, in the hundreds place, there are none, which makes sense because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens: 40-49,140-149, etc., each 10 numbers, 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each set is 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds: 400-488, which is 488-400+1=89. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's a big difference. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for fours. Tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Yes, that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct.

Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For the eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for eights again.

So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: for the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each because the last page is 488, which is an 8 in the units place. For the tens place, 4 appears 50 times because from 40-49, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10. For 8, the tens place is 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488, which is 5 sets of 10 except the last one, which is 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nFor fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, +89=188.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nI think that's correct.

Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place.

So, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.

    "text": " The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last one, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, the total for tens place is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counting for eights in the tens place. When I considered 480-488, I said there are 9 numbers, but let me count them: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total eights are 49+49=98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. For units place, I had 49 fours. Let me check that. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1) =484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Yep, 98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, resulting in 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place for every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
