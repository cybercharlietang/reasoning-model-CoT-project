    "text": " Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. Okay, that seems right. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That's correct: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Units place for fours: 49, because from 4 to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems correct. For eights, units place:49, correct. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's = \u230a484/10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   Number of 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's = \u230a488/10\u230b + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488).  \n   Number of 8's = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.**\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Correct.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-499), but since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a lot, but 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. That seems to be the main reason for the difference.

When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, giving 50 fours. That's correct. For eights, the tens place goes up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, yes, I think the answer is 90. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is the 49th occurrence, that's 49 fours. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place, it's up to 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place. So, all counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.

Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block of 10 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 numbers here, each contributing one 4.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThere are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me double-check the tens place for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. And units place for eights: from 8,18,...,488. Let's see, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. 188-98=90.

Wait, when counting the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, 5 sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, the total fours are 49+50+89=188, and eights are 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for fours would have more, but no, it's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently, like using a formula for digit counting. The formula for counting the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be used, but since I'm doing it manually, maybe I can check using that approach. Let me try that. For a number like 488, to count the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each complete group of 10, there's one 4. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. But wait, does the last partial group (481-488) include a 4 in the units place? 484 is in there, so that's one more, making it 49. So, 49 in units place.\n\n- Tens place: For each complete group of 100, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 488 /100=4.88, so 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete group (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that group, which is 10 numbers (400-409, but wait, 400-488. Wait, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400-488 includes 400-409, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4*10 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated before.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188, same as before.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial group (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each complete group of 100, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers (80-89, etc.). So, 4 complete groups (1-100, etc.), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete group (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: As before, no 8's here.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours there. Units place for fours: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, which is 49 times. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10, so 5 sets, 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.

Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for eights, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me try another approach for the units place of fours and eights. For units place of 4: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for units place of 8: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place of 4: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. How many blocks? 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. For the tens place of 8: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, except the last block where it's only up to 488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: For fours, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, no hundreds place digits are 8. So, all correct. Therefore, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

Hmm, seems correct. Wait, but wait a second. When I was counting the hundreds place for fours, I considered from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place:49. So 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me go through each digit position again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 50. Hundreds place:400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10: (488-8)/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four sets are 10 each, last set is 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Maybe I can think of another way to count. Alternatively, I could count the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: for 4, it's every 10 numbers, so total pages is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th cycle, we have 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Similarly for 8, it's the same, so 49 times. Wait, but that's the same as before. For the tens place, for 4, it's 10 per hundred, so 4 hundreds (0-399) each have 10, and then 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 more. So 4*10 +10=50. For 8's in tens place, it's 10 per hundred up to 400, and then 480-488 is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. For hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, same as before. So, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49=98. Difference is 90.

This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n   **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
