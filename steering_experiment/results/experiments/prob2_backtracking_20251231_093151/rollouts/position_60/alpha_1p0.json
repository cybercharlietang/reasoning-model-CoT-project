    "text": " Let's go through each digit position again for both digits. For 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...484. That's 484/10=48.4, but since we include both endpoints, it's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula for digit counting. The formula for counting a specific digit d in numbers from 1 to n is a bit involved, but perhaps I can apply it here. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me try another approach. Let's think of each digit place separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each. Units place: For any digit, the count in the units place up to n is floor((n + 1)/10). So for 4's: floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48. But wait, that's not matching what I had before. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when counting how many times a digit appears in the units place, it's actually (n // 10) + 1 if the digit is <= the units digit of n. Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think again. For units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus one if the units digit of n is >=d. So, for 4's in units place up to 488: 488 // 10 = 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, we add 1, making it 49. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 488 //10 =48, and since 8 <=8, we add 1, so 49. Correct. Now, for tens place: The formula is a bit more complex. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to n is calculated by considering higher digits and the lower digits. The formula is: higher = n // 100, current = (n // 10) % 10, lower = n % 10. If current > d: count += (higher + 1) * 10\nIf current == d: count += (higher + 1) * 10 + (lower + 1)\nIf current < d: count += higher * 10\n\nBut wait, I think I might have misapplied this before. Let me apply it correctly for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nFirst, for 4's in the tens place:\n\nn = 488\nhigher = 488 // 100 =4\ncurrent = (488 //10) %10 =8%10=8\nlower =488 %10=8\n\nWe're looking for digit d=4.\n\nSince current=8 > d=4, the count is (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. That matches my earlier count.\n\nNow for 8's in the tens place:\n\nd=8\n\ncurrent=8, which is equal to d=8.\n\nSo, count = (higher +1)*10 + (lower +1) = (4+1)*10 + (8+1)=5*10 +9=50+9=59. Wait, but earlier I counted 49. That's a discrepancy. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, because when current equals d, the formula is (higher +1)*10 + (lower +1). But in this case, higher is 4, so (4+1)*10=50, and lower is 8, so +9. So total 59. But earlier, I thought it was 49. Wait, that can't be right. Because in reality, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our n is 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So total 40+9=49. But according to the formula, it's 59. That's a conflict. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts from 0, but we're starting from 1. Let me check the formula again. The formula is designed for numbers from 0 to n. So, when n=488, the formula counts 0-488, which includes 489 numbers. But in our case, we're only considering 1-488, which is 488 numbers. So, perhaps the formula overcounts by 1 if d=0, but in our case, d=8, so maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, the count is 59, but manually, I count 49. That's a problem. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, and I made a mistake in manual counting. Let's see:\n\nFrom 0 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 0-99: 10 times (80-89)\n- 100-199:10 (180-189)\n- 200-299:10 (280-289)\n- 300-399:10 (380-389)\n- 400-488:10 (480-489), but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488)\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. But according to the formula, it's 59. Wait, that's a contradiction. So, perhaps I'm applying the formula incorrectly. Let me double-check the formula.\n\nThe formula for the number of times digit d appears in the tens place up to number n is:\n\ncount = higher * 10 + min(max(d - current, 0), 10) * 10 + something... Wait, maybe I'm misremembering the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to approach it differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is as follows: For the tens place, the count is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\n\nif the tens digit of n is greater than d, then add 10\n\nif the tens digit of n equals d, then add (n % 10 + 1)\n\nSo, for d=8, n=488.\n\nn // 100 =4, so 4 *10=40\n\ntens digit of n is 8, which is equal to d=8, so add (8 +1)=9\n\nTotal count:40+9=49. That matches my manual count.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula I used earlier was incorrect. So, in that case, for d=8 in tens place, it's 49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=4 in tens place, n=488.\n\nn//100=4, so 4*10=40\n\ntens digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so add 10\n\nTotal count:40+10=50, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake earlier when applying the formula for d=8. So, the correct count for 8's in the tens place is 49, not 59. So, that's 49. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought of the formula giving 59, I thought I must have made a mistake, but now, using a different approach, I get 49, which matches my manual count. So, I think I was correct initially with 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSimilarly, for fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, ..., 488. So, 488 -400 +1=89. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place in eights: since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total eights:98, fours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, another way: Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers.\n\n8's:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n8's:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four sets contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. Last set:480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:400-488:89 numbers.\n\n8's:0.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me recount the 4's. Units place: From 4,14,...484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now for the 8's. Units place:8,18,...488. The last term is 488, which is 8 mod 10. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 =480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So 49+49=98 eights. So 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly? Another way: for each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately. Maybe I can use a formula for each position. Let's try that. For any digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of each position separately and count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 -400 +1 =89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAnother way: Let's consider the number of digits in each position.\n\nTotal number of page numbers is 488.\n\nNumber of units digits: For each page number, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many times does each digit 0-9 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining numbers. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then the remaining 8 digits (0-7) appear once more. So, for units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: 48 +1 (since 4 is within 0-7) =49.\n\nNumber of 8's: 48 +1 (since 8 is within 0-7) =49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page. So, 488 is the 488th page. So, the units digits go up to 8 in the last page. So, yes, 49 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, 88 more numbers (401-488). So, for the tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds *10=40 times each digit.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each digit in the tens place from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers.\n\n411-420: tens digit1, 10 numbers.\n\n...\n\n481-488: tens digit8, 8 numbers.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers (481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: In the full hundreds, 40 times. In the remaining 88 numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Looking at 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in the tens place: In full hundreds, 40 times. In the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Earlier, I thought the tens place for 8's was 49, but now it's 49 as well. Wait, no, earlier I had 49, but let me see. So, in the full hundreds, each digit appears 40 times, and in the remaining 88 numbers, 4's appear 10 times, 8's appear 9 times. So, for 4's in tens place:40+10=50, and 8's in tens place:40+9=49. So, that matches my earlier count.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nIn 488 pages, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For 8's, the hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake, but after rechecking, it seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but the tens digit can still be 4 in 440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in tens place. Then, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. That seems right. For the eights: units place, 8,18,...488: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9).

Let me check. In fours: 484 is the last units place 4, and 488 is in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, no, 488 is 4-8-8, so the hundreds digit is 4, which is counted in the hundreds place for fours. So, that's correct. For eights, 488 is in the tens and units place, but the hundreds digit is 4, so it's only counted in the tens and units places for eights. Wait, no, 488 has an 8 in the tens and units place, so that's two eights. So, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, which is the 9th number in that set, right? Because 480 is the first, 481 is second, up to 488 as the 9th. Wait, no, 480 is the first, so 480 is 1, 481 is 2, ..., 488 is 9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, that's correct. So, 49 eights in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90.

    "text": " Wait, when counting the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but maybe that's correct. Let me recount the units place for 4's. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place of 4's: from 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, each of 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For tens place of 8's: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me think: from 1-488, how often does 4 appear vs 8. Since 4 is lower than 8, it's possible that 4 appears more often, especially in the hundreds place. Wait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, while 8 doesn't appear at all. So that's a big difference right there. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place, and 0 eights, so that's 89 more fours just from the hundreds place. Then, in the tens and units places, fours and eights are similar, but since 4 appears in the hundreds place so much more, the total difference would be 89 plus the difference from the tens and units places. Wait, but in the tens and units places, fours and eights are both appearing 49 and 49 times respectively, so the difference from those would be zero. So, the total difference is 89 fours in the hundreds place, which is 89 more fours than eights. But earlier, I calculated that the total number of fours is 188 and eights is 98, so the difference is 90. Wait, that's inconsistent. Because 89 (hundreds) + (49+50=99 for fours) but wait, no, the 89 is part of the 188. Let me clarify: The total fours are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. The total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check again because I feel like maybe I'm overcounting. Let me think about the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. The eights don't appear in the hundreds place, so that's 89 more fours. Then, in the tens and units places, the number of fours and eights are both 49 and 49 respectively, so they cancel out. So, the total difference is 89 fours more. But wait, earlier I calculated the total fours as 188 and eights as 98, which gives a difference of 90. So, which is correct? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me recount the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in numbers 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50 fours. Correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 fours. Eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours, tens:50 fours. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. That seems right. For the eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can think of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another approach: For units and tens places, each digit from 0-9 appears the same number of times in each position, except maybe the last set if it's not a full hundred. Let me see.\n\nFor units place:\n- For 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for 488 numbers, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). Each cycle has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 cycles contribute 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total fours in units place: 48 +1=49, eights:48 +1=49. That matches my earlier count.\n\nFor tens place:\n- Similarly, each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-409: tens digit 0), 1 (410-419: tens 1), ..., up to 8 (480-488: tens 8). So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there in 401-488? For 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. For 8's in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, adding to the earlier counts: fours in tens place: 40 +10=50, eights in tens place:40 +9=49. So, total fours in tens place:50, eights:49. That matches my earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n- From 1-399: hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n- No 8's in hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total=49+50+89=188.\nTotal eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total=98.\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.

Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place and 49 eights in the tens place. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but another way to think about it: maybe I should check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.

So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th decade, from 480-488, there's another 4 at 484. So, 48 +1=49 fours in units place. That's correct. For the tens place, each hundred has a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For the eights: units place, same logic, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488: 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Tens place for 4: from 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct.

So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, yes, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: 98. So, 188-98=90.

So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Wait, when counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But does that include all the fours in the hundreds place? Yes, because every number from 400 to 488 starts with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so the 4 in the tens place would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. Maybe I should check a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. 4's: 4,14 => 2 fours. 8's:8,18 => 2 eights. So, 2-2=0. Wait, but according to my method, units place: 4,14 => 2. Tens place: 40-49 is beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. So, total fours:2. Eights: units place:8,18 =>2. Tens place:80-89 beyond 20, so 0. So, eights:2. So, difference is 0. Which is correct. Another example: 50 pages. 4's:4,14,24,34,44. Units:5. Tens:40-49:10, but wait, 40-49 is within 50, so 10 numbers. So, tens place:10. Hundreds:0. So total fours:5+10=15. Eights: units:8,18,28,38,48:5. Tens:40-49 is 40-49, but 40-49 is in the tens place, but 8 in tens place is 80-89, which is beyond 50. So, eights:5. So, difference:15-5=10. Let me count manually: fours:4,14,24,34,44 (units:5), and 40-49 (tens:10). So, 15 fours. Eights:8,18,28,38,48 (units:5). So, 5 eights. So, difference 10. That seems correct. So, my method works.
