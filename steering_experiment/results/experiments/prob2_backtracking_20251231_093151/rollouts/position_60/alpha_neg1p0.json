Hmm, so 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake because sometimes when counting, overlaps can happen, but in this case, each digit position is independent, so I think it's correct. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using place values and digit frequencies. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of 4's and 8's. Let's try that method to cross-verify. For a three-digit number, each digit can be considered separately. Let's consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) and count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n- For units digit, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? As before, every 10 numbers, so 49 times.\n- Similarly, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n- For tens digit, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so for 488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419,...,480-488. Wait, actually, in the tens place for 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours:40 (from 0-399) +10=50. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each 100, 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For hundreds digit, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- Fours: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) = 188\n- Eights: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0) =98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, same result.

For example, in the tens place, when I counted 40-49, does that include numbers like 44, which also has a 4 in the units place? But when counting digits, each digit is counted separately, so 44 would have two 4's, both counted in their respective places. So, that's correct. Similarly, 88 would have two 8's, both counted.

So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place.

So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering each digit position separately and calculating the number of times each digit appears. For example, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except maybe the last few numbers if the total isn't a multiple of 10. Similarly for tens and hundreds places. But since we already counted manually, and the numbers add up, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
