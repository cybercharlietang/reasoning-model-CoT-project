    "text": " So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, which is beyond 488, so no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but when I added units and tens, it's 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can check a smaller range to see if my method works. For example, let's say a book with page numbers up to 20. How many fours and eights? Page numbers:1-20. Fours:4,14 \u2192 2 fours. Eights:8,18 \u21922 eights. So, 2-2=0. Let me apply my method. Units place fours:4,14 \u21922. Tens place fours: none, since 40-49 is beyond 20. So, total fours=2. Units place eights:8,18 \u21922. Tens place eights: none, since 80-89 is beyond 20. So, total eights=2. So, 2-2=0, which is correct. Another test: up to 50. Fours:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 fours. Eights:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925 eights. So, 5-5=0. Using my method: units fours:5 (4,14,24,34,44). Tens fours:40-49 is 10 numbers, but up to 50, so 40-49 is 10, but in 1-50, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in tens place. Wait, but in reality, up to 50, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in tens place, plus 5 in units place (4,14,24,34,44). Wait, but 44 is counted in both units and tens. Wait, no, in my initial method, I count units and tens separately, so 44 would have a 4 in both places. So, total fours would be 5 (units) +10 (tens) =15. But wait, in reality, up to 50, the fours are: units:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925. Tens:40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49 \u219210. So, total fours=15. Eights: units:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925. Tens:40-49 is beyond 8's tens place, so only 80-89, which is beyond 50. So, eights=5. So, 15 fours -5 eights=10. But in reality, up to 50, fours are 15 and eights are 5, so 10 more fours. So, my method works here. So, applying it to 488, I think 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, except the last block (480-488), which has 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check again. Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total eights: 49 +49=98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49)=98. Wait, but let me think again. For the tens place, each hundred block (except the last one) contributes 10 eights. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. Now, let me confirm the counts again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, correct. And for eights, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so no eights there. So, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90 more fours.

Because in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, units place:49, tens place:49, total 98 eights. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Eights: units place:49, tens place:49, total 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480-488: 9. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, total 49 in tens place. Units place:49, so 98 eights. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Wait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so 98 total. Now, let's compare the number of fours and eights. Number of fours:188, number of eights:98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check if I missed anything. Wait, in the units place for fours, I had 49 numbers. Let me confirm: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place in fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

When I counted the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40, and 480-488 gives 9, so 40+9=49 in the tens place.

That's 9 numbers, right? So, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Hmm, but wait, when I did the fours, I had 188, and the eights are 98. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting for eights. Units place: 8,18,...,488.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the tens place, in the hundreds, like 440-449, that's another 10 fours, so 10 in the tens place for each hundred block. So, 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Plus the units place: 49, and hundreds:89. So, 49+50+89=188. Yep, that's correct.

There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. For the tens place, the sets are:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nAdding these: 10+10+10+10+9=49.

    "text": " Wait, but the hundreds place for numbers 1-99 is 0, so no 8's there either. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights are 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the tens place. The first set is 80-89:10, then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and the tens place was 49, so 98 in total. So, 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I overcounted the fours. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place is 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for eights would be zero, which it is, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. But wait, let me think again. When counting the units place for eights, I went up to 488, which is correct. And for the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but I feel like that might be too high. Let me check another way. Maybe I can write out the counts more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a different method to verify. For example, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:** As before, every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Since we have 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0 to 488, that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 hundreds (each contributing 10) plus 10 from 440-449, but wait, no, actually, each hundred from 0-99, 100-199, etc., up to 300-399, each have a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. Then, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50. That's correct.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full decades, but including 488, so 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 0-488, how many hundreds? 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times. In the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** As before, no 8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but upon checking each digit place carefully, it does add up. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each set contributes 10 except the last, which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Wait, but when counting the tens place for eights, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that part is right. Similarly, units place for eights goes up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Yes, that's correct. So, the total fours are 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188-98=90.

Units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

    "text": " Wait, let me think again. The hundreds place can be 0,1,2,3,4 since the book is 488 pages. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I was counting the units place for 4's, I thought it was 49, but let me verify. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those 8 numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from full groups) +1 (from the partial group) =49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Since 488 is less than 500, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each: 50. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 in units. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800 and above, but our book ends at 488, so there are no such numbers. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds is 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Wait, but let me check the units place again. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, which is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place:49, tens place:49, so total eights:98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check all my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90.
