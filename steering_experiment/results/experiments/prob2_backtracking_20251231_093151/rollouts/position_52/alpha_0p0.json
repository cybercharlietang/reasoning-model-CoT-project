Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98 eights. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the units place, 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. For the tens place, as above, 49. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's recount the fours: Units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 50, correct. Hundreds place:89, correct. Total fours:188. Now, eights: Units:49, Tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. Hundreds place: From 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. Now, for the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Units place:49 fours. So, total 188 fours. Eights: Units:49, Tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again. The book goes up to 488, so in the hundreds place for fours, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. But for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, yes, 49 eights in tens place. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position separately, but perhaps I missed something in the tens place for eights. Wait, in the tens place, the sets are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place:49, so total 98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, I think that's correct.

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me verify the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the tens place in fours, we had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place in fours, 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 480-489 would be 10, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98. The question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again. For fours: units place: 4,14,...484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, +1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, except the last set which has 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
