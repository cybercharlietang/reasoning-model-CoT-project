    "text": " The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count each set. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yep, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place there. So, the tens place for 8's is 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 after 8. Let me list: 8,18,...,488. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, let's count the number of complete blocks first. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So, yes, 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488 inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), totaling 40 eights.\n   - The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: number of 4's (188) minus number of 8's (98) equals 188 -98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, I counted from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400+1=89. And each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. For the tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1=49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 (480-488). So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, right? Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is 90.

So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for fours. When I counted units place fours, I went up to 484, which is 484.

Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each set: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms there are, we can model it as an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1=8, common difference d=10, and last term l=488. The nth term is given by l = a1 + (n-1)d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. Each full block (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: here, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers). Wait, because 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check that again. Each hundred block (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. The last hundred block is 400-488, so in the tens place, 80-89 would be in the 0-99 block, 180-189 in 100-199, 280-289 in 200-299, 380-389 in 300-399, and 480-488 in 400-488. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights because it stops at 488.

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights.

So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Counting fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Counting eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I was counting fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That seems right. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for eights in the units place, from 8 to 488, step 10. Same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90.

So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Checking eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When I considered 480-488, I counted 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, but wait, actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480 is the first, 488 is the ninth). Wait, no: 480 is the first, 481 is the second, ..., 488 is the ninth. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, we have 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488) = 49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term in this sequence (since 488 = 8 + 10*(48)). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check my calculations again to be sure. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 49+49=98. 188 - 98 = 90.

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count how many sets of 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each set is 10 numbers, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49.

Wait, that can't be right because 188 -98 is 90, but let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so that's 10 eights in the tens place for each of these. There are four full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets \u00d710=40 eights.

Let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence starts at 4, ends at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. So, 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488 -400 +1=89. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the eights:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 mod 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, as before.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in eights. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if 488 is included. So, for the units place, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's counted. For the tens place, 488 has an 8 in the tens place as well, right? Because 488 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units). So, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, which is the 9th number after 480, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that set.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, 488 doesn't have an 8, so no problem.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). Let me count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go through the fours again: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90 more fours than eights. But let me think again: when counting the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for 480-488. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 90 seems a bit high, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. But 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488-400+1=89. So that's correct. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, total:98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have miscounted. Let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds, 50 in tens, 49 in units. 89+50=139, 139+49=188. Eights: 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) plus 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count as the 49th 8 in the units place? Let me check: starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, 8,18,28,...,488. So, from 0 to 488, that's 488/10 = 48.8, which would mean 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, let me check that again. 188 - 98 is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let me count: from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, the tens place has 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. Wait, but let me think again. Each full hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so up to 400, that's 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place is 49. Tens place: as above, 49. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. Specifically, in the tens place, I considered 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, units place eights: 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. For fours, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. That seems correct. So, yes, 89. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 blocks * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
