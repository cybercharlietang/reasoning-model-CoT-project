Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, so total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The problem asks how many more fours there are than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8. So, how many terms? The first term is 8 (which is 0*10 +8), then 18 (1*10 +8), up to 488 (48*10 +8). So, the number of terms is 49 (since 0 to 48 is 49 numbers). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many numbers in each set? Each full set like 80-89 has 10 numbers. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but let's check the last number. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=488. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 8*49=392, which is not 488. Wait, actually, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of times 8 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, 48*10=480, so up to 480, we have 48 eights in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 8 more numbers, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units had 49 and tens had 49, so total 98 eights. But wait, let me double-check the tens place count. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for eights. Let me check again. The units place for eights: from 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The last term is 488, which is 8*61=488? Wait, no, 8*61=488, but that's not correct because 8*61=488? Wait, 8*60=480, so 8*61=488. So, the number of terms is 61. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count. Wait, I'm confused now. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488, which is 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more, making it 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. So, earlier count was correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, that's correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? 484 is the 49th term because 484/10=48.4, so 49 terms. So, 49 fours in units place. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the units place for fours. Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms, we can use the formula: ((last term - first term)/step) +1. So, ((484-4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, so ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 fours.\n\n**Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n   - Total: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 eights.\n\n**Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of fours - Number of eights = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributes 10 eights. There are four such blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.

Units: 49, tens:49, so 98. Yes, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. For units place, from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. That's correct. Similarly, for tens place, 40-49, etc., each block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.

Let me count: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks with 10 eights each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block with 9 eights (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many numbers in each set? Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 +9=49.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so for 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, I had 4 full hundreds (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10, so that's 4*10=40, and then 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. So, yes, tens place is 49. Units place is also 49, so total 98. So, number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place, so up to 400, we have four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. That matches the earlier count. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

The first is 8 (which is the 8th number), and the last is 488. To find how many, we can think of it as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8, so that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count how many sets there are. Each full set is 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 full sets and one partial set.

    "text": " From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me see: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, is that right? Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in counting, but let me just verify the tens place for eights. In the tens place, the sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, and the last set has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9). So, 40+9=49. Yep, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Units place for fours: up to 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98 eights. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, that's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, no, actually, 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check: from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me confirm. Each hundred block except the last one (400-499) has 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights because 489 would be beyond 488.

So, yes, 49 in tens place. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. And in the tens place, 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Units place:49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Wait, 440-449: that's 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. But 449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, yes, 188 fours. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets we have. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (each contributing 10 eights) and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, each set of 10 in the tens place contributes 10 eights, right? So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, that's 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. Hmm, but earlier for fours, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to confirm.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, since 800+ is beyond 488. So 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which equals 90.

Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many numbers in each block? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.

    "text": " 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: starting from 8, then 18, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Wait, but 480-488 is within the 480-489 range, so how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, let's count each block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems lower than I thought. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. Yes, that adds up to 49. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have made a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I considered up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10 in each of the four earlier decades (80-89, 180-189, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Units place: 49 eights, so total eights are 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I feel like that's a big number. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me try another approach. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a 3-digit number, each digit can be from 0-9, except the hundreds digit which can't be 0 in the case of page numbers 100-488, but wait, actually, page numbers from 1-9 are single-digit, so maybe it's better to think in terms of 3-digit numbers with leading zeros, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, considering the ranges. Let me try that again more carefully. **Counting 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:** For each complete set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 four, so 48 fours. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's an extra four in the units place. So, total units fours: 48 +1=49. That matches my earlier count.\n\n- **Tens place:** For each complete set of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, that's 10 times. So, total tens fours: 40 +10=50. That matches my earlier count.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. That's 89 numbers, as calculated before. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:** Similarly, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1-488, how many? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each with one 8, so 48. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 8 in units place, so that's an extra. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- **Tens place:** For the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). From 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens eights:40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** As before, no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal eights:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me try a different approach, perhaps using a formula or considering each digit position more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nfloor((N + 1) / 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, actually, the formula is a bit more precise. For each digit position, the count can be calculated by considering higher digits and the current digit.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to stick with my initial method, as it's straightforward.\n\nWait, let me check the units digit for 4 and 8 again.\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\nNumbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many? Let's compute (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor units digit 8:\n\nNumbers are 8,18,28,...,488. Similarly, (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens digit for 4:\n\nIn each hundred, 40-49:10 numbers. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449:10 numbers. So, total 50. Correct.\n\nTens digit for 8:\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89:10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488:9 numbers. So, total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds digit for 4:\n\nFrom 400-488:89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nHundreds digit for 8:\n\nNone, as before.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds digit for 4, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But does that include 400? Yes, because 400 is included. So, 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit in 480-488, that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8'.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: 8 is the first, then every 10 up to 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The last number is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many sets of tens have 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-489 is included. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the tens place eights would be 40 (from the first three sets) plus 9, totaling 49. Wait, no. Let me think again. The first three sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4 sets, 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is another set where the tens digit is 8, but it's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me count again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, so 98 eights in total. But wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, the tens place in the hundreds of 400-499 would have 9 eights instead of 10 because the book ends at 488. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place. Let me check again. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 eights, so from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So total eights:49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe I missed something. Let me think again. For the tens place, in the 400s, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, yes, 40 +9=49. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. Now, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

Let me see: 8,18,...,488. So, how many terms? It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
