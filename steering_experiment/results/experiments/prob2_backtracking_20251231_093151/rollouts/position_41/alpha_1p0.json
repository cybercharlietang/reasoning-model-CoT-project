    "text": " The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Wait, but in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So total eights are 49+49=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly verify my counts again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " The first 8 is at 8, and the last one is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each full set (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many full sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set with 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but is 480-488 9 numbers? Let me check: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 49 eights. Wait, but wait, earlier I thought each full set is 10, but the last set is only 9. So, total tens place eights are 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a 90 difference. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for eights. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. Similarly, units place: 49. So, 98 eights. For fours, units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 188. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct. Wait, but let me think about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That's correct. So, the final answer should be 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place for fours. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Eights in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10+9=49. Correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block (480-488) with 9 numbers.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the tens digit is 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. Let me count each block. From 80-89: that's 10 numbers, so 10 eights. From 180-189: another 10. From 280-289: another 10. From 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights, and 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.

So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except the last one which might be shorter. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The formula would be (488 - 8)/10 +1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the book's pages. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total for tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, which is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Wait, but in the tens place, I had 4 sets of 10 and then 9, which is 49. So, 49+49=98. But wait, let me check if I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, yes, tens place is 49. Units place is 49, so total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400+1=89. For the tens place of fours, it's 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights: units place is 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and 480-488 contributes 9, so 4*10+9=49. Correct. So, total fours=188, total eights=98. Difference=188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.

Let me count how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, except the last block, which goes from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds: 0. So, 49+49=98. Hmm, seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights again. **Counting Fours:**\n- Units place: From 4, 14, ..., 484. How many numbers? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10) +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units.\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\n**Counting Eights:**\n- Units place: From 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see: The last number is 488, which is 8 mod 10. So, the count is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, each set before that has 10 numbers. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me count how many sets there are. Each 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9 =49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.
