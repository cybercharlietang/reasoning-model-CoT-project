    "text": " So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm going to cross-verify this with another approach to make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. Let's consider each digit position separately. **Units place:**\n- For 4: As above, 49 times.\n- For 8: 49 times.\n\n**Tens place:**\n- For 4: 50 times.\n- For 8:49 times.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n- For 4:89 times.\n- For 8:0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90. Yes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let's do that.\n\n**Units place:**\n- For each page number, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers.\n- The number of complete cycles in 488 pages is 48 full cycles (480 pages) plus 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- In each cycle, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n- So, 48 cycles contribute 48 fours and 48 eights.\n- The extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units place: 48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights.\n\n**Tens place:**\n- The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0-9 appearing 10 times in the tens place.\n- For 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 80-88 pages in the 400-488 range.\n- Wait, no, actually, the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n- So, for the tens digit:\n   - In each hundred block, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same with 8.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (0-399), so 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights in the tens place from the first 400 pages.\n   - Now, the last partial hundred is 400-488, which is 89 pages. The tens digit here goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488).\n   - So, in the tens place for 400-488:\n      - For each tens digit from 0 to 8, except for 9, we have 10 numbers each, except for 8, which only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers.\n      - So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n      - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - So, adding to the previous count:\n      - Fours in tens place: 40 +10=50\n      - Eights in tens place:40 +9=49\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n- The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n- So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so no pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total counts:\n- Fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188\n- Eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that confirms the earlier calculation. So, I'm confident that the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 times), totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
