This gives 49 occurrences (since 484 is the 49th term).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., up to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal number of '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of '4's printed is 90 more than the number of '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
