Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, I might double-count or miss some numbers. Let me try another approach to verify. Let's consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8 and count them again. For 4's: Units place: numbers ending with 4 from 4 to 484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is part of the 400-499 hundred block, but only up to 488. So, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in hundreds place. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: numbers ending with 8 from 8 to 488. The count is floor((488-8)/10)+1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: In each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers. From 0-99:80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: No 8's here, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. I think that's correct.
