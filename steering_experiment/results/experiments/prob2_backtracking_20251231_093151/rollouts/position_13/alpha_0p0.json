    "text": " To find how many, I can use the formula: ((last - first) / interval) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (since 449 is within 488). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Wait, wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, okay. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, the first four blocks contribute 4*10=40, and the last block contributes 9, so total 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98, yes. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks each of 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place: 49, so total 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens place 8's are in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, yes, that's correct. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. So, 98 8's. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1. That gives me (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but does 484 count? Let me check: 484 is within 1-488, so yes. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. How many such sets are there? From 40-49 (first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, the last set is 440-449. Does 449 fall within 488? Yes, so all 5 sets are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. Each set before that has 10 numbers, but the last set has only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full sets and one partial set. Each full set contributes 10, so 4*10=40, and the partial set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times, I can calculate how many numbers are in this sequence. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, and since they're spaced every 10, that's 480 / 10 = 48. But I need to add 1 because both endpoints are included. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference is 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another, but since the book ends at 488, the last one is 488. So, how many such ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only up to 488. Let's check each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 49 total.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The count is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, 5 blocks. 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.

Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so that means there are 48 full decades. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (48-1)*10. Let me check: 4 + 10*47 = 4 + 470 = 474. Hmm, that's not 484. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, there's exactly one number with 4 in the units place. So, how many sets of ten are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 481 has 1, 482 has 2, ..., 488 has 8. So, 484 is included in this last set, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 (from the full sets) + 1 (from the last partial set) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but 440-449 is okay. Let me count each of these ranges. - 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, in each set of ten numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 (from full sets) + 1 (from last partial set) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. Let's count each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 times 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: How many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these has 8. So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I counted 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, 4's total 188, 8's total 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many 4's are in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the units place, the 48th 4 would be at 480, and then 484 is the next 4 in the units place. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit, which is floor(488/10) = 48 times. But wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor(48.8) is 48, which means 48 times. However, let me check if 488 includes an extra 4 in the units place. Since 488 is the last page, the units digits go up to 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(48.8) is 48, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. The number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears, which is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, so the 49th occurrence is at 488. So, 49 times. Wait, let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, so 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me check again. For the tens place of 4's, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 is correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9=49. So, 49 is correct. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. So, which is correct? Let me calculate it properly. The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, actually, there are 49 4's in the units place, not 48. Wait, so I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Let me correct that. So, for 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188. Similarly, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so I had a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. It should be 49, not 48. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. Hmm, so I need to correct that. Let me go through it again to make sure.\n\nFirst, units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1=49. So, 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nUnits place for 8's: from 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place for 8's: 5 ranges, each with 10 except the last one which has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so I initially thought 48 for units place of 4's, but it's actually 49. So, the correct difference is 90, not 89. Let me check once more to be sure.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=48.4 +1? Wait, no, (484-4)=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10=48, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place for 4's: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nTens place for 8's: 5 ranges, 4 full with 10, last with 9, so 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90. So, I think the correct answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check: starting at 4, each 10 numbers add one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think: For each ten (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each ten, 4 appears once in the units place. There are a total of 488 numbers, so how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. In each of the 48 full tens, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last one is 440-449. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each time the tens digit is 4, which happens in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there up to 488? The hundreds digit goes from 0 (for numbers 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, for hundreds digit 0: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in tens place. For hundreds digit 1: 140-149: another 10. For hundreds digit 2: 240-249: another 10. For hundreds digit 3: 340-349: another 10. For hundreds digit 4: 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times 4 in the tens place. So total tens place 4's: 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me make sure. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each ten has one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. In each of the 48 full tens, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here as well (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit being 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place per block. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: hundreds digit 0: 80-89: 10 numbers. Hundreds digit 1: 180-189: 10. Hundreds digit 2: 280-289: 10. Hundreds digit 3: 380-389: 10. Hundreds digit 4: 480-488: here, it's only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here, not 10. So, let me correct that. So, the first four blocks (hundreds digits 0,1,2,3) each contribute 10 times 8 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last block (hundreds digit 4) contributes 9 times 8 in the tens place (from 480 to 488). So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 8. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Wait, but when I did this earlier, I got 48, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and in the last partial ten, 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in units place there. So units place 4's: 48. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributes 10. There are 5 such blocks (0-4 in hundreds place), so 5 * 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10, except the last one. How many blocks? Hundreds digits 0,1,2,3,4. For hundreds digits 0,1,2,3: each has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. For hundreds digit 4: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Hundreds place: no 8's, as before. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but I thought 89 was a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me think differently: perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or another method. Another approach is to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position. For a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a specific digit appears can be calculated based on higher and lower digits. Let me try this for 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as follows:\n     - Higher digits: everything to the left of the units place.\n     - Current digit: 4.\n     - Lower digits: everything to the right of the units place.\n   - For N = 488, units digit is 8, tens digit is 8, hundreds digit is 4.\n   - Since we're looking at units place, the formula is:\n     - higher = 48 (the number formed by digits higher than units place, which is 48 for 488)\n     - current = 8 (units digit)\n     - lower = 0 (since there are no digits below units place)\n     - count = higher * 10^0 + (if current > 4, add 1) else 0\n     - Wait, no, the formula is a bit different. The standard formula for digit counting is:\n       - For each digit position, the count is:\n         - higher = number formed by digits to the left\n         - current = digit at current position\n         - lower = number formed by digits to the right\n         - if current > target: (higher + 1) * 10^lower_digits\n         - if current == target: higher * 10^lower_digits + (lower + 1)\n         - if current < target: higher * 10^lower_digits\n       - But since we're dealing with 4's, let me apply this to units place:\n         - higher = 48 (from 488, digits to the left of units place)\n         - current = 8\n         - lower = 0\n         - target = 4\n         - Since current (8) > target (4), count = (higher + 1) * 10^0 = (48 + 1) * 1 = 49\n         - Wait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 48. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n         - Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate using this formula.\n         - For units place, target digit is 4.\n         - higher = 48\n         - current = 8\n         - lower = 0\n         - Since current (8) > target (4), count = (higher + 1) * 1 = 49\n         - So units place 4's: 49\n         - But earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, where's the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Let me try this formula for 4's in units place:\n\nN = 488\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- higher = 48 (digits left of units place)\n- current = 8\n- lower = 0\n\nSince current (8) > target (4), the number of 4's in units place is (higher + 1) * 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where I thought it was 48. Let me check manually. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? They are 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see: 484 is the last one ending with 4 before 488. So, how many terms in this sequence?\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between each term is 10. The first term a = 4, last term l = 484, common difference d = 10.\n\nNumber of terms n = ((l - a)/d) + 1 = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 49. So my initial count was wrong; it's actually 49, not 48. I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nSimilarly, let's redo the count for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: Let's apply the formula again.\n\nFor tens place, target digit is 4.\n\nN = 488\n\n- higher = 4 (hundreds digit)\n- current = 8 (tens digit)\n- lower = 8 (units digit)\n\nSince current (8) > target (4), the count is (higher + 1) * 10^1 (since we're in tens place, which is 10^1) = (4 + 1) * 10 = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So tens place 4's: 50.\n\nHundreds place: target digit is 4.\n\nN = 488\n\n- higher = 0 (no digits higher than hundreds place)\n- current = 4 (hundreds digit)\n- lower = 88 (the last two digits)\n\nSince current (4) == target (4), count = higher * 100 + (lower + 1) = 0 * 100 + (88 + 1) = 89.\n\nSo hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 187. Hmm, seems like I made a mistake in the units place earlier. So according to this formula, units place 4's are 49, not 48. So total 4's are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but when I counted manually earlier, I thought units place 4's were 48. But the formula gives 49, and the manual count via arithmetic sequence also gives 49. So my initial count was wrong; it's 49.\n\nSimilarly, let's apply the formula to 8's.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nN = 488\n\n- higher = 48\n- current = 8\n- lower = 0\n- target = 8\n\nSince current (8) == target (8), count = higher * 1 + (lower + 1) = 48 * 1 + (0 + 1) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- higher = 4\n- current = 8\n- lower = 8\n- target = 8\n\nSince current (8) == target (8), count = higher * 10 + (lower + 1) = 4 * 10 + (8 + 1) = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- higher = 0\n- current = 4\n- lower = 88\n- target = 8\n\nSince current (4) < target (8), count = higher * 100 + 0 = 0 * 100 = 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but with the correct units place being 49, it's 188. So the difference is 90. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 89. I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me confirm again.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought units place 4's were 48, I got 187 4's, and 98 8's, so difference 89. But now, with correct units place 4's being 49, it's 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me recount the units place 4's manually. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4?\n\nThey are 4,14,24,...,484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484.\n\nSo, 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, 49 numbers. So units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and the last partial ten (481-488) includes 488, which is another 8. So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo units place 8's: 49.\n\nTens place 4's: 50.\n\nTens place 8's: 49.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nHundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears in every 10th number. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in every 10th number. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 each and a partial block contributing 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many, I can calculate how many groups of 10 are there from 1 to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? Let's see: 484 is the last one before 488, so yes, 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. The total number of blocks is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and a partial block). But wait, the partial block from 481 to 488 would include 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, total 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of such numbers is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units place. To find this, we can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial group includes 488, which is another 8. So, total 49 times. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 480, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 (since 480/10=48). Then, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count how many such ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10, and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would happen from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, plus an additional 4 in 484, totaling 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, plus an additional 8 in 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 occurrences, and 480-488 contributes 9. Totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " To find how many, I can divide 484 by 10, which gives 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488, so the units digit is 8. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 8*10=80, so 8,18,...,488. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8 as the first. Let me check: 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but this calculation shows 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. For units place of 4's: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, last term is 484. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, I think I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48. Similarly, for the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. For hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Wait, that's different from my earlier 187. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated before. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens place: 5 blocks of 10: 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89. So total 49+50+89=188. Now, for the 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So total tens place:40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. I think I made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's earlier. Let me confirm: The units digit 4 occurs in 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is calculated as ((484 -4)/10)+1=48.4, but since it's inclusive, it's 49 terms. So, 49 units place 4's. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought 488 is included in the units place for 8's, so that's correct. Let me check if 488 is counted in the units place for 8's: Yes, 488 ends with 8, so it's included. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 is included, which adds 9 numbers. So, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98 8's. 4's:49 units,50 tens,89 hundreds:188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check again. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1). So, 484-4=480=10*(n-1). So, n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. So, 49+50+89=188. 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488:49. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The 4 appears in the units place in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49  \n   - Total: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each block (40-49, etc.) has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488.  \n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89  \n   - Total: 89\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The 8 appears in the units place in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49  \n   - Total: 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, meaning the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. But since 484 is within this range, the 48th set includes 484 as the 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, and 488 is 48*10 + 8, so 488 is the 49th set? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th set, but the 4 in the units place occurs at 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, actually, it's 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) in 488. Since each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place, it's 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4, and then 481-488, which doesn't add another 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is the 488th page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many ranges? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, that's fine. So, 50 times. Wait, but let me check: from 0-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199:140-149 (10). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in this range, the hundreds digit is always 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, so 88+1=89. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 1-488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, let's check: the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 48th set, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many ranges? From 0-99:80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, in the hundreds place, the 480-488 range contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total for tens place: 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 0-99:80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9). So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 +49 +0=97 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many terms are there in this sequence? Let's see, the first term is 4, and each subsequent term is 10 more. The last term is 484. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included. Let me check: 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 480-489 would be 9 numbers because the book ends at 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. - 140-149: another 10 4's. - 240-249: another 10 4's. - 340-349: another 10 4's. - 440-449: another 10 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Let's see, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-489 is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many sets of 10 are there? - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: another 10 8's. - 280-289: another 10 8's. - 380-389: another 10 8's. - 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many, I can use the formula: ((last occurrence - first occurrence) / interval) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the last page, so I need to check if 484 is within the book's pages. Since the book has 488 pages, 484 is included. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred block contributes 10, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 pages, so does 440-449 fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, seems high, but let me think. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, first occurrence is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let me count each block: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that's a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the tens place, I thought there were 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. But wait, let me check each block:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49: 10\n- 100-199:140-149:10\n- 200-299:240-249:10\n- 300-399:340-349:10\n- 400-488:440-449:10 (since 449 is within 488)\nTotal: 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 0-99:80-89:10\n- 100-199:180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). Let me solve 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: from 8 to 488. Similarly, 8 + 10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the units and tens places. Let me take a smaller example to test. Suppose the book has 100 pages. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nUnits place for 4:4,14,...,94: 10 numbers.\n\nTens place for 4:40-49:10.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's:20.\n\nUnits place for 8:8,18,...,98:10.\n\nTens place for 8:80-89:10.\n\nTotal 8's:20.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-100, 4's and 8's in units and tens would be equal. So, in 100 pages, 20 each.\n\nBut in my earlier calculation, for 488 pages, I have 188 4's and 98 8's. That seems correct because as the number of pages increases beyond 100, the 4's in the hundreds place add more, while 8's don't get that.\n\nWait, another check: let's count 4's and 8's from 1-100.\n\n4's: units:10 (4,14,...,94), tens:10 (40-49), total 20.\n\n8's: units:10 (8,18,...,98), tens:10 (80-89), total 20.\n\nSo, same.\n\nFrom 101-200:\n\n4's: units:10 (104,114,...,194), tens:10 (140-149), total 20.\n\n8's: units:10 (108,118,...,198), tens:10 (180-189), total 20.\n\nSimilarly, from 201-300: same, 20 each.\n\nFrom 301-400: same, 20 each.\n\nFrom 401-488: let's see.\n\n4's: units: from 404,414,...,484. That's 9 numbers (since 404 to 484 is 9 steps of 10: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484). So, 9.\n\nTens place: 440-449:10.\n\nHundreds place:401-488:88 numbers (since 488-400=88, but 401-488 is 88 pages, but wait, 488-400=88, so 88+1=89 pages. Wait, earlier I thought it was 89, which is correct.\n\nSo, 4's in 401-488: units:9, tens:10, hundreds:89.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 includes 400? No, 401-488 is 88 pages, but 400 is included in 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 401-488 is 88 pages. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 400 is page 400, and 488 is the last page. So, 400-488 is 89 pages (including both 400 and 488). So, 400 is page 400, 401 is 401, ..., 488 is 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages.\n\nSo, in 400-488, 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\nIn 401-488, 4's in units place:404,414,...,484. Let's see: 404 is 400+4, 414=410+4, up to 484=480+4. How many terms? From 404 to 484, step of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 404)/10) +1= (80/10)+1=8+1=9. So, 9.\n\nTens place:440-449:10.\n\nSo, in 400-488, 4's: units 9, tens 10, hundreds 89. Total:9+10+89=108.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. But if I break it down per hundred blocks, from 0-99:20, 100-199:20, 200-299:20, 300-399:20, 400-488:108. So total 20\u00d74 +108=80+108=188. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nFrom 1-100:20.\n\n101-200:20.\n\n201-300:20.\n\n301-400:20.\n\n401-488: let's see.\n\nUnits place:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9.\n\nTens place:480-488:9.\n\nSo, units:9, tens:9. Total 18.\n\nSo, in 401-488, 8's:18.\n\nTherefore, total 8's:20\u00d74 +18=80+18=98. Which matches earlier count.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the units place, 484 is counted once, and in the hundreds place, 440-449 are counted in tens and hundreds. But since we're counting digits, each digit is counted separately, so no overlap in counts. So, the total should be correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):** There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):** There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):** There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):** There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):** There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** There are 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where d is the common difference (which is 10 here). So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Let's solve for n: 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but the book only has 488 pages, so does 484 + 10 = 494, which is beyond 488? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check. The last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is correct. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me think differently: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total number of tens places is 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that matches my earlier calculation. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges are there in 1-488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, ..., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 + 50 + 89. Let's add them up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same page numbers. Let me do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. Let me see: The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? Using the same method as before: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. 488 - 8 = (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), we have 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488. The first range is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10). Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). But wait, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges do we have? The first four ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 occurrences. Then, the partial range 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 occurrences. Now, total number of 8's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets. Each set has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. Let me check if 488 is included. The units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 449 is within 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me make sure. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 times, but let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So, actually, there are 49 times 8 appears in the units place. Let me think again: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Let me count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, we can take the floor of that. So, 48 times, but wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 4 (which is the 1st). Wait, no, actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. From 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, and then 8 extra numbers. In each full decade, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each digit appears once per decade. So, in 48 full decades, 4 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. Therefore, total 4's in the units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each time the tens digit is 4, which occurs in blocks of 100. From 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, in 0-99: 10 times, 100-199: 10 times, 200-299: 10 times, 300-399: 10 times. That's 40 times. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, yes, that's 10 more. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Let's count how many times. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 0-99: 10 times, 100-199: 10 times, 200-299: 10 times, 300-399: 10 times. That's 40 times. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48 times. That seems correct because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place.\n- Tens: 50 times.

Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, and 484 is within the range, so actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10). However, I think I might be missing something here. Let me check: the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, and then we check if the remainder is more than 4. The remainder is 8, which is more than 4, so we add 1 more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the formula is (n // 10) + (1 if n % 10 >= d else 0), where d is the digit we're looking for. So, for units place, it's (488 // 10) = 48, and since 488 % 10 = 8, which is greater than 4, we add 1, so total 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many sets? From 0-399, there are four sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. Each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, but the hundreds digit is only one digit, so each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Using the same method as before: 488 // 10 = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (n // 10) + (1 if n % 10 >= d else 0). Here, d=8. So, 488 //10=48, and 488%10=8, which is equal to d=8, so we add 1. So, total 48 +1=49 times. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each of the first four sets contributes 10, so 4*10=40. The last set contributes 9. So, total 40 +9=49 times. Wait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears 0 times.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find the total count, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full groups and then a partial group. But since 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place before 488, that's 48 times. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, right, I made a mistake earlier. So it's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 0-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 0-488, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 have 8's in the tens place. So, the first four ranges are full: 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the last range, 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, actually, it's 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the last partial range from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but does 484 count? Let me check: 484 is within 488, so yes, it does. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one set. Then, 140-149: that's another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. For example, 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in the tens place. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is the range where the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. To find how many numbers that is, I can subtract 400 from 488 and add 1 (since both ends are inclusive). So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89 numbers. But wait, I'm interested in how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full sets. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think: from 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, the next is 18, and so on. The last one would be 488, which is the 49th number. So, that's 49 times. Hmm, earlier I thought 48, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let's see how many sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488 as well. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's count the sets. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, total occurrences in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me double-check. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to ensure accuracy. **Counting 4's again:**\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but wait, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 484 is the last one, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, because 4,14,...,484 is 48 numbers. Because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, 48 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but then I added 50 in tens and 89 in hundreds to get 187. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in units place. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so it's 48 full tens, but the 48th occurrence is at 480, right? Wait, 480 has 8 in the tens place, but 480 is 480, so 480 is 480, which is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, 0 in the units. Wait, so 480 has 4 in the hundreds place, but 480 is part of the hundreds place count. But when counting units place, it's only the units digit. So, 480 would have 0 in the units place, so the last number with 4 in the units place before 488 would be 484, which is 484. So, the count is 48 times. So, units place: 48. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\n**Counting 8's again:**\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 488-8=480, so 480 \u00f710=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 terms. So, 49 times.\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n- Hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but does 488 have 8 in the tens place? Let me check: 488 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units). So, yes, 488 has 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct, 9 numbers from 480 to 488 inclusive.\n\nWait, but 480 is 4-8-0, so the tens digit is 8, and units is 0. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in a certain place is using the formula for digit frequency.\n\nFor units place: For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10).\n\nFor tens place: floor((n + 1)/100) * 10 + max(0, (n + 1) mod 100 - 10*d).\n\nWait, maybe I should use a more systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nLet me try that for both 4's and 8's.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n- Units place:\nThe formula is: (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0). Wait, no, that's for counting numbers where the units digit is >=4. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nActually, for each digit position, the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the units digit:\nThe number of times digit d appears is (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly correct. Let me think again.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nThe number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not accurate. Let me think of it as:\n\nFor units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to n, the number of times digit d appears in the units place is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0), but only if d !=0, because numbers don't have leading zeros.\n\nWait, but for d=4, it's:\n\ncount_units_4 = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0)\n\n488 //10 = 48, 488 %10=8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me check with actual numbers.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Let's list them:\n\n4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484.\n\nNow, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + 10*(48-1) = 4 + 470 = 474? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, earlier, I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Hmm, so I made a mistake earlier. So, the correct count for units place of 4 is 49.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong before? I think I forgot that 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 4 is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 49 as well, because 488 is included.\n\nSo, let's correct the counts:\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nTens place for 4: numbers where the tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.\n\nSo, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. So, the last one is 484. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, with common difference 10, up to 484.\n\nNumber of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place:49 (as before)\n- Tens place: Let's recalculate.\n\nTens place for 8: numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nThese are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive).\n\nSo, total tens place for 8:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place:0, as before.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, now the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. So, which one is correct?\n\nI think the mistake was in the units place for 4's. Initially, I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, total 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's:50.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49.\n\nTotal:89+50+49=188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe using the digit frequency formula.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount_units = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100) - d*10 +1).\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\ncount_hundreds = (n // 1000) * 100 + max(0, (n % 1000) - d*100 +1).\n\nBut since our n is 488, which is less than 1000, the hundreds place calculation is a bit different.\n\nWait, let me try applying this formula.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: (488 //10)=48. (488 %10)=8 >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: (488 //100)=4. So, 4*10=40. Now, (488 %100)=88. So, max(0, 88 -4*10 +1)=max(0,88-40+1)=max(0,49)=49. So, total tens place for 4 is 40 +49=89? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I think I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, the formula for the tens place is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100) - d*10 +1).\n\nSo, for d=4, n=488.\n\ncount_tens = (488 // 100) *10 + max(0, (488 %100) -4*10 +1).\n\n488 //100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488 %100=88.\n\nSo, 88 -40 +1=49.\n\nSo, count_tens=40 +49=89.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier we thought it was 50. Hmm, perhaps the formula is different.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, up to 400, we have 4 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), which is 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total 50 times. So, the formula might not be correctly applied earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not appropriate here because when the higher digits are involved, it's better to count manually.\n\nSo, perhaps trusting the manual count is better here.\n\nSo, to avoid confusion, let's stick with the manual count:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place, it's 90. So, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nAnother way to check is to consider smaller numbers and see if the method works.\n\nFor example, let's take a book with 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers:1-20.\n\nCount of 1's:\n\nUnits place:1,11 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place:10-19 \u219210 times.\n\nTotal:12.\n\nCount of 2's:\n\nUnits place:2,12 \u21922 times.\n\nTens place:20 \u21921 time.\n\nTotal:3.\n\nDifference:12-3=9.\n\nAlternatively, using the manual method:\n\nFor 1's:\n\nUnits:2 (1,11).\n\nTens:10 (10-19).\n\nTotal:12.\n\nFor 2's:\n\nUnits:2 (2,12).\n\nTens:1 (20).\n\nTotal:3.\n\nDifference:9.\n\nSo, the method works.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's and 8's in 488 pages, the difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 appears 90 more times than the digit 8 in the page numbers.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with complete groups, it's 48 times. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 6, so maybe I should check. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 do we have? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, that means there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In those 8 extra numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a range of 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, I need to check how many such ranges exist up to 488. Let's see: The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is indeed less than 488, so yes, that's the fifth range. So, 5 ranges x 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if there's a partial range beyond 449. The next range would be 540-549, but 540 is greater than 488, so it doesn't count. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8, so that's included. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit. 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each complete range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many complete ranges there are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges are complete (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, and the last partial range (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 187, total 8's: 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5x10=50. That's correct. And for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 complete ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the last partial range 480-488 contributing 9, so 4x10 + 9=49. That seems right. Units place for 4's: 48. Because from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, so 48 times, and the last partial set doesn't have a 4 in the units place. Units place for 8's: 49, because the last partial set includes 488, which adds one more. Okay, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.  \n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.  \n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.  \n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.  \n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete ranges and a partial range (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.  \n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 488.  \n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. Let me count how many full sets of 100 there are. From 0-488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds go up to 400-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in each hundred block once for 10 numbers. Let me see: 40-49 is one set, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 4, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. So, how many sets? 80-89 is one set, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places for 8: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97 times. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the digit 4: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 187. For the digit 8: units place: 48, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total: 97. Difference: 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the tens place for 4 again. I had 5 sets of 10 numbers each where 4 is in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For 8, the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct. Units place for both digits: 48 each. Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, yes, the total for 4 is 187, 8 is 97, difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4 to 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 8 to 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last set being 480-488 (9 times), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last occurrence. The last number before 488 that ends with 8 is 488 itself. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let me count each range: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9. So, total in tens place: (4\u00d710) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the hundreds place of 4's and 8's. For the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, which is correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there with 4 in the units place? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). But we need to check up to 488. So, from 1-400, how many sets of 100 are there? 4 sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens place can be 4 (440-449) and 8 (480-488). Wait, but we're only counting 4's, so in 401-488, the tens place is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many terms? Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. From 401-488, the tens place is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449, adding 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488, adding 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, to find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many numbers are there from 4 to 484 with a step of 10. That would be (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the last page, which is 488, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, I need to check how many such ranges are there within 1 to 488. - 40-49: 10 numbers (40 to 49). - 140-149: 10 numbers. - 240-249: 10 numbers. - 340-349: 10 numbers. - 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last occurrence: 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's calculate each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: number of terms = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 ranges * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is part of this count. So, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many terms are there. First term is 8, last term is 488, common difference is 10. Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another (10 numbers). Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 8's. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate the number of terms in this sequence. The formula for the number of terms when you have a starting point and an ending point with a common difference is: Number of terms = ((Last term - First term) / Common difference) + 1. Here, First term = 4, Last term = 484, Common difference = 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 4 appears 49 times in the units place. Wait, but let me check if 484 is within the 488-page limit. Yes, 484 is less than 488, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exceed 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. But wait, let me make sure. For example, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. First term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference is 10. Number of terms = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 8 appears 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: Is there a range where the tens digit is 8? The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place occurs only up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, how many ranges? Let me think: For 0-399, we have 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 8 appears 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. Correct. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8 again. When I was counting the tens digit for 8, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 numbers, which is correct.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th set. So, 48 times. But wait, let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Let me think again. Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, so from 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? It's the number of times 4 appears in the units digit. So, the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages after that. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of tens places. Since 488 is less than 500, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 1-480) plus one more at 484, making it 49. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10). So, for n=488, floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, which floors to 48. So, 48 times. But wait, that contradicts my earlier count. Let me check with smaller numbers. For example, from 1 to 20, how many 4's in the units place? They are 4 and 14, so 2 times. Using the formula: floor((20 +1)/10) = floor(21/10) = 2. That works. So, from 1 to 488, it's floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. Okay, so units place: 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Wait, 48+50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? Using the same formula: floor((488 +1)/10) = 48.9, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so let's check: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 48*10 +8=488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, so maybe the formula is off. Let me test it with n=8: floor((8+1)/10)=0.9, which is 0, but there's one 8. So, the formula isn't perfect. Alternatively, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of times 8 is the units digit, which is floor(n/10) if n >=8, else 0. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate it as follows: The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the remainder is >=8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, and since the remainder is 8, we add one more. So, 48 +1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each contributes 10 eights. The last range is 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), each with 8 in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) =4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:187, total eights:98. The difference is 187-98=89. Wait, let me confirm the calculations. Fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of 4's: \u230a(488 + 1)/10\u230b = 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's: \u230a488/10\u230b + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full range contributes 10 8's, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " To find how many 4's are in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488 and then see how many times 4 appears in each group. But maybe a better way is to divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8. In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, the last group goes up to 488, so in the units place, 488's units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, and the tens digit is 4 for all of them. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is in the two-digit numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, 449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last group, from 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, because from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1-8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So total units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range. 80-89: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So total tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, no. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4 to 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8 to 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, n = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so I need to check if 480-489 is within the range. Since the book ends at 488, the tens place 4's go up to 449. Let me count how many sets of ten have a 4 in the tens place. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449: another 10. How many such sets are there? Well, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is fully included in the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is within range, so all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I'm only supposed to count the digit 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Using the same formula: n = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count how many sets of ten have an 8 in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last set 480-488 contributes 9. So total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place \u2192 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many, I can calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10 to get 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. That gives 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups and then a partial group from 481 to 488. In that partial group, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149: another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's a full set. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but the problem is about digits, not numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the partial group from 481-488, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 80-89: that's one set. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Wait, but does 480-489 exist? Since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, 480-488 is another set where the tens digit is 8. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. The sets before 400 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's correct, 9 numbers. So, 40 (from the earlier sets) + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and an additional 4 in 484.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another range, another 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many ranges? Let's count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In a three-digit number, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-499. But since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the occurrences of 4: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me count how many times. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. Each set has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra 8? Let me think: the last number is 488, which is the 48th set (since 48*10=480, and 488 is 480+8). So, the units place 8 in 488 is included in the 48th set. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges are within 488. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus the partial range 480-488 with 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 8 appears 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full sets, so 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 numbers, plus 9 numbers in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set would end at 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in 484. So, actually, it's 48 times plus one more, making it 49 times. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of times 4 is the units digit. So, for each ten, like 0-9, 10-19, etc., the 4 appears once in each ten. So, how many tens are there? From 0 to 488, there are 488 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens and a partial tenth. Each full ten contributes one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the partial tenth (480-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (40 to 49), which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. In the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, but wait, maybe I'm overcounting. Wait, no, each digit place is separate, so it's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8. Then, in the partial tenth (480-488), 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So, total 48 +1 =49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: yes, that's one. 180-189: another. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. So, that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 *10=40 times. Wait, but does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, does that count as another range? Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the tens digit from 480-488 is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but earlier I thought of ranges as 80-89, which are 10 numbers. So, does 480-488 count as a full range? No, because it's only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, does that mean the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488? Wait, but 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8, and 481, 482, etc., up to 488, so yes, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's an additional 9 8's in the tens place. So, earlier I had 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, the 480-488 contributes 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so I think I should include that. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times. Let me check that again. The ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, 9 8's\n\nSo, 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The number of times is floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the last number is >=484. Since 484 is <=488, it's 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: ranges 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of times is floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 because 488 is included. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9. Total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. For the tens place of 4's, the ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, so 49.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 8's. Does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with 8. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: for units digit 4's, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's 488//10=48, plus 1 if 488 >=4. Since 488 ends with 8, which is higher than 4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8's, 488//10=48, plus 1 because 488 ends with 8, so 49.\n\nSo, units digits are correct.\n\nFor tens digits:\n\nFor 4's, we have 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nFor 8's, 4 full ranges and one partial, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 4's in hundreds place: 89, which is a lot. 4's in tens place:50, units:49. So, 188 total.\n\n8's in units:49, tens:49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, and the last number in the units place would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as for each complete set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, totaling 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does the units place have a 4? Yes, 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49, which is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets is that? From 40-49, that's 1 set, then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. In this range, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times this happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, totaling 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does the units place have an 8? Yes, 488 is within that range, so that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the range is 480-488. Let's see how many such sets there are. Starting with 80-89, that's one set, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set is only up to 488, so it's 9 numbers (480-488) instead of 10. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last set, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 1 set \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total: 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I overcounted in the tens place for 4's. Let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 + 1\u00d79=49. That seems correct. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 full sets of 10 (48\u00d710=480) plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total occurrences: 5\u00d710=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 48 full sets plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4\u00d710 + 1\u00d79 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then a partial group. But wait, actually, each group of 10 contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: from 1-10, once at 4; 11-20, once at 14; and so on. So the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of tens in 488. Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So in every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the 48th set would end at 480, and then we have 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. In those 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but that might not be correct. Let me check with a smaller number. For example, from 1-10: units place 4 appears once. 1-20: twice. So 1-480: 48 times, and then 481-488: one more at 484, so total 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-488 is beyond 449. So, let's count these ranges. Each time the tens digit is 4, it's for 10 consecutive numbers. So from 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. And 440-449: another 10. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times. So 5*10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So yes, all these ranges are within 1-488. So 50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So 5*10=50. So 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 4 appears 188 times. Now, I need to count how many times 8 appears. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 8 is 488. So how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So let's count each range. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 +1=9 numbers. So that's 9 times. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10*4 +9=40+9=49. So 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So 0 times. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 +0=98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's)=90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find the count, I can subtract 4 from 484 and then divide by 10, then add 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, then +1 gives 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, which is within 488. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, then +1 gives 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of it. So, let me count the blocks: 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (another 10). 200-299: 280-289 (another 10). 300-399: 380-389 (another 10). 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, let me calculate: The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - 480-488: 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? Well, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we'll take the integer part. Wait, but actually, it's better to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 numbers. So, in each of the 48 complete sets, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is another occurrence. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such sets are there? Let's see, from 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, each hundred has one such range (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so the range 440-449 is within that. So, how many complete hundreds? From 1-400, there are four complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing a range where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 440-449 is the only range where the tens digit is 4. So, yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Now, moving on to the digit 8. Let's do the same analysis for 8. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is another occurrence. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8. **For 4's:**\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: In each hundred, 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 such hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4*10=40. Then, 440-449 in 400-488, which is another 10, so 50 total. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So 89. Correct. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**For 8's:**\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place: 40+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0, as before. Total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like this might not be accurate because when I think about page numbers, maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me try another approach by considering each digit position separately and using a formula.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as follows: For units place, it's floor(N/10)*1 + (if the remainder is >= d, add 1 else 0). Similarly, for tens place, it's floor(N/100)*10 + some adjustment based on the remainder, and for hundreds place, floor(N/1000)*100 + adjustment.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a more systematic approach. Let's define a function to count the number of times a digit d appears in each position.\n\nFor a given number N, the count of digit d in the units place is:\n\nunits = (N // 10) * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - d + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, actually, the formula is:\n\nunits = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10 >= d) else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + (min(max(N % 100 - d*10 + 1, 0), 10) if N % 100 >= d*10 else 0)\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\nhundreds = (N // 1000) * 100 + (min(max(N % 1000 - d*100 + 1, 0), 100) if N % 1000 >= d*100 else 0)\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down differently. Let me look for a standard digit counting method.\n\nThe standard way to count the number of times a digit d appears in each position up to N is as follows:\n\nFor units digit:\n- The number of complete groups of 10 is N // 10.\n- Each group contributes 1 occurrence of d in the units place.\n- Then, check the remainder: if N % 10 >= d, add 1.\n\nFor tens digit:\n- The number of complete groups of 100 is N // 100.\n- Each group contributes 10 occurrences of d in the tens place.\n- Then, the remainder is N % 100.\n- If the remainder >= d*10, add (remainder - d*10 + 1), else add 0.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n- The number of complete groups of 1000 is N // 1000.\n- Each group contributes 100 occurrences of d in the hundreds place.\n- Then, the remainder is N % 1000.\n- If the remainder >= d*100, add (remainder - d*100 + 1), else add 0.\n\nWait, let me apply this to d=4 and N=488.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. Units place:\n   - Complete groups: 488 // 10 = 48\n   - Each contributes 1, so 48\n   - Remainder: 488 % 10 = 8\n   - Since 8 >=4, add 1\n   - Total units: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. Tens place:\n   - Complete groups: 488 // 100 = 4\n   - Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40\n   - Remainder: 488 % 100 = 88\n   - Since 88 >= 40 (d=4, so 4*10=40), the difference is 88 - 40 +1 = 49\n   - So add 49\n   - Wait, that can't be right because 488 is less than 500, so the tens place can't have more than 10 occurrences per hundred. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula for the tens place is:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + max(0, (N % 100) - 40 + 1)\n\nBut wait, if N % 100 is less than 40, we don't add anything. So for N=488:\n\ntens = 4*10 + max(0, 88 - 40 +1) = 40 + (88 - 40 +1) = 40 + 49 = 89? That can't be right because in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears only 10 times in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, in 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, which would be 50, but 488 is less than 500, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more, making it 50. But according to the formula, it's 4*10 + (88 -40 +1) = 40 + 49=89, which is way too high. So, I must have misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check an alternative approach.\n\nAnother way is:\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\n- From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Then, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\n- So total tens place: 40 + 10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, as before, 49.\n\nFor hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Complete groups: 488//10=48, each contributes 1, so 48.\n\n- Remainder: 8, which is >=8, so add 1.\n\nTotal units:49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Complete groups:488//100=4, each contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n\n- Remainder:88.\n\n- Now, for the tens digit 8, the formula is:\n\nmax(0, (88 - 80) +1)=9.\n\nSo, total tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so my initial calculation was correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just think again: 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times. 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me try to count another way, perhaps by considering each position separately and using the standard digit counting method.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10) =48, plus if 488%10 >=4, which it is (8>=4), so 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, 488%100=88. The tens digit is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, so the additional count is (88 -40) +1=49. Wait, but that would make 40+49=89, which contradicts our earlier count of 50. Hmm, so perhaps the formula is not being applied correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the tens place is:\n\ntens_count = (N // 100) * 10 + (if N % 100 >= d*10, then (N % 100 - d*10 +1), else 0)\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488:\n\ntens_count = (488 // 100)*10 + (488 % 100 >=40 ? (488%100 -40 +1) : 0)\n\nWhich is 4*10 + (88 >=40 ? 88-40+1=49 :0) =40 +49=89.\n\nWait, but that's conflicting with our earlier count of 50. So, where is the mistake?\n\nAh, I think the formula counts the number of times the tens digit is >=4, but in reality, we're only interested in when it's exactly 4. So, the formula might not be directly applicable. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for digits greater than or equal to d, not exactly d.\n\nWait, no, actually, the formula counts the exact digit d. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when using the formula, for the tens place, we're looking for how many times the tens digit is exactly 4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (40-49). So, in 488, how many hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's giving 89, which is way too high. So, perhaps the formula is not suitable for exact digit counts but rather for digits greater than or equal to d. Alternatively, maybe I'm misapplying it.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm misunderstanding what it's counting. Let me see: if d=4, then in the tens place, the formula counts how many times the tens digit is >=4. So, for N=488, the tens digit is 8 in the last partial hundred, so the formula counts all tens digits from 4 to 8, which is 5 digits, each appearing 10 times? Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is designed to count the number of times the digit is >=d, not exactly d. So, for example, if d=4, the formula counts how many times the tens digit is 4,5,6,7,8,9 in each hundred.\n\nBut that's not what we want. We want exactly 4. So, perhaps the formula isn't directly applicable for exact digits. Therefore, maybe it's better to stick with the manual counting as before.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for 4's, we have 50 occurrences, as calculated earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 49 occurrences, as calculated.\n\nTherefore, the total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** \n     - The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n     - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n     - **Total in units place:** 49.\n   \n   - **Tens place:**\n     - '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n     - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), contributing 40.\n     - The range 440-449 adds another 10.\n     - **Total in tens place:** 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n     - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:**\n     - '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - 48 complete sets contribute 48, with the last partial set adding 1.\n     - **Total in units place:** 49.\n   \n   - **Tens place:**\n     - '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n     - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences for the first four hundreds, totaling 40.\n     - The range 480-488 adds 9 more (480-488).\n     - **Total in tens place:** 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n     - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 are there in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, so the next number is 481, which is still in the 48th group? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is the last digit. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the same as the number of tens, which is 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488), but 484 is within that range. So, actually, it's 48 times in the units place. Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's the same as the number of tens, which is 48 full tens (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488), which includes 488. So, 48 times in the units place. Wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, does that add another 8? Let me think. The units digit cycles every 10, so the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the last number is 8. Wait, no, actually, from 1-488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 is the last digit. That would be 48 times for each ten, but let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total 187. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the units place for 8 again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? They are 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 times. Similarly, for 4's in units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484. So, ((484 - 4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate the units place for 4. The units digit is 4, starting at 4, then every 10. The last number is 484. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, actually, units place for 4 is 49 times, not 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said units place for 4 was 48. Let me correct that. So, units place for 4: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, so earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check again. Units place for 4: 4,14,...,484. Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Similarly, units place for 8: 49 times. Tens place for 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. Hundreds place for 4: 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1=89). So, 89 times. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, difference is 188 - 98=90. So, the answer should be 90. I think I initially miscalculated the units place for 4, thinking it was 48 instead of 49. So, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 40 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set would end at 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 at 484. So actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the next 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check the last set. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. From 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But again, check if 488 is included. 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and then 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are from 1 to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and the next numbers are 481-488. Since 484 is within this range, the 48th group includes 484. So, that's 48 times. But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) is 48, but let me check if 488 includes another 4 in the units place beyond that. Wait, 488 is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5\u00d710=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (as before), but let me check if 488 is included. 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10)=48, but wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 itself ends with 8, does that mean the 48th occurrence is at 488? Wait, actually, the first 8 is at 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. So, how many numbers? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is 48 times because 488 is included. Wait, but let's think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's different. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by floor((n + 1 - d)/10). So, for d=8, n=488, it's floor((488 +1 -8)/10)=floor(481/10)=48.1, so floor is 48. But wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The difference between terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count how many full blocks there are and the partial one. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Wait, that's a big number. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10)=48, but wait, 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place:48.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the units place for 8's. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many numbers? Let's see, the first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, which is 10 each. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 187-98=89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check again. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast:\n\nFor units place of 4's:\n\nThe numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's 49 as well.\n\nSo, correcting that, the total 4's would be:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, the formula is ((last - first)/step)+1.\n\nFor 4's in units place:\n\nFirst term:4, last term:484, step:10.\n\nSo, ((484-4)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nFirst term:8, last term:488, step:10.\n\n((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place for 4's is 49, not 48 as I initially thought.\n\nSo, correcting that, total 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow, 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now with corrected units place for 4's, it's 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the units place. It should be 49, not 48.\n\nLet me confirm: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is 49, as calculated.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's:5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49.\n\nTens place for 8's:49.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but with the formula, it's 49. So, the correct count is 49.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but now it's 49. Let me check with a smaller example to see which is correct.\n\nSuppose n=44. How many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 numbers. Using the formula: ((44-4)/10)+1=(40/10)+1=4+1=5. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=488, units place 4's: ((484-4)/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the initial count was wrong; it's 49, not 48.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds):\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find how many, I can calculate how many sets of 10 are there in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets, but since 484 is the last one, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, right? So yes, 5 blocks, so 50 times. Wait, but from 400-488, 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 numbers. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, let me check. 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers each time, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50. That seems right. For the units place of 4's: up to 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, but 484 is 480 +4, so 484 is the 48th 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Correct. Now, for the 8's: units place, I had 49 numbers. Let me list some to check: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 +10(n-1). So, 8+10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, 8's total 98. 4's total 187. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 and 9 in the last partial block, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 89 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, right? So, each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (1st set), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Okay, that's the number of 4's. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is the last one, so that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place.

So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, for the hundreds place, 4 can appear in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 488 is part of this. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that addition again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers are there? 488 // 10 = 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 488 has an 8 in the units place, so yes, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) 100-199: 180-189 (10) 200-299: 280-289 (10) 300-399: 380-389 (10) 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (from 1-399) and 1 range of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units (48), tens (50), hundreds (89) \u2192 48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units (48), tens (49) \u2192 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the counts again, especially for the tens and hundreds places, because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake there. Let's recount the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, so 89. Correct. For the 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for 8's: 488//10=48, correct. So, yes, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n**Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
