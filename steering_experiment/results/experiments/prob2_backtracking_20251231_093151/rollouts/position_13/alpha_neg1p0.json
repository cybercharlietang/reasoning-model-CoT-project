    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10 and taking the integer part, which gives 48 full groups of 10. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But actually, each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page. Let me see: 488 is 480 + 8, so the units digit goes up to 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, yes, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, units place: 48 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be up to 449, which is within 488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place: 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place: 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98; 98+89=187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, but the last group is 488, which is exactly 48*10 +8=488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 +1? Wait, no. Because 8 is the first occurrence, which is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want the nth term \u2264488. So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u2192 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, there are 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 occurrences of 8. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the numbers are 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, then 481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 occurrences of 8. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 occurrences of 8. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the units place for 4 again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24,...,484. The number of terms is floor(488/10)=48, but since 484 is the last one, which is 48*10 +4=484, so that's correct. So, 48 times. For 8's in units place, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last has 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, yes, 187-98=89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers between 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, and a_n = 484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n = 49. Wait, that seems too high because 488 is the last page. Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. But wait, 484 is the last page, so that's correct. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each hundred have 4 in the tens place. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each hundred contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 sets. But wait, the 400-488 set is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that. So, each hundred except maybe the last one contributes 10. Let me check: 400-488: The tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for the tens place: 5 sets * 10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400-488? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 488 - 8 = 480 = (n-1)*10. So, 48 = n-1, so n=49. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th term. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count each hundred: From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total for tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place is the number of terms in this sequence. The formula for the number of terms when the difference is constant (like 10 here) is ((last term - first term) / difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, and then 480-489, but since it stops at 488, the tens place 4's go up to 488. Let me check each hundred: - 1-99: 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. - 100-199: 140-149: another 10 times. - 200-299: 240-249: another 10 times. - 300-399: 340-349: another 10 times. - 400-488: 440-449: 10 times, and then 480-488: but wait, 480-488 is in the hundreds place, but the tens digit here is 8, so actually, in the tens place for 400-488, the 4's in the tens place are only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding up: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50 times. Wait, but 400-449 is 50 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 only for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10 each, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when counting the hundreds digit, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Let me check: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each hundred: - 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. - 100-199: 180-189: another 10 times. - 200-299: 280-289: another 10 times. - 300-399: 380-389: another 10 times. - 400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 8's are: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems like a lot more 4's than 8's. Wait, when I counted the 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the 4's in the tens place, I had 10 in each hundred up to 400-449, which is 5 sets, so 50 times. And units place, 49 times. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds 0, so 98. 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Wait, but let me think again: in the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as part of the 400-488 range, but when counting 4's in the tens place, each hundred from 1-99, 100-199, etc., up to 400-488, each had 10 4's in the tens place except the last one, which was 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, so 50. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, each hundred up to 300-399 had 10 8's, and the last set in 400-488 had 9 8's in the tens place, making 49. So, that's correct too. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by seeing how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check: The last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 48 * 10 + 4. So, 48 times. Therefore, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers.

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 4's. Okay, now I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, that's 49 times because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: From 1-488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears as the last digit. The first is 8 (1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 (49th). So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 How many? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought each range contributes 10 8's, but in the last range, it's only 9. So, let me adjust. The first four ranges (0-399) each contribute 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place here. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 8's in the tens place. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 8's total. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, and tens place was 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's were 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, which is correct? Wait, 4 is the first, then 14, 24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 4's in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place, 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each contributes 10, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 49+50+89=188 4's. Wait, earlier I thought 48 in units, but now I'm getting 49. I think I made a mistake earlier. So, correct count for 4's in units place is 49, not 48. So, 49+50+89=188 4's. Now, 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check again. Units place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484=4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=(484-4)/10=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 4's in units. Similarly, units place for 8's:8,18,...,488. 488=8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=(488-8)/10=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in units. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u2192 50 4's. Tens place for 8's:80-89,180-189,...,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10, the last has 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 400-488 has 89 4's, 800-899 would have 90 8's, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Ranges: 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute 10 each (4 \u00d7 10 = 40).\n   - Last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the number of terms, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: last term = first term + (n-1)*common difference. Here, the common difference is 10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Solving for n: 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, ..., 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99, there's one block (40-49). From 100-199, another block (140-149). Similarly, up to 400-488. Let's see how many blocks there are. The last block is 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 440-449 block is entirely within the range. So, how many blocks? 40-49: 1 block, 140-149: 2nd block, 240-249: 3rd block, 340-349: 4th block, 440-449: 5th block. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's the fifth block. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each digit place again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same formula: last term = first term + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488 -8 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these blocks. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another block. From 200-299: 280-289 is another. From 300-399: 380-389 is another. Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block. Let's see how many numbers are there from 480 to 488: 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, the 480-488 block contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 1, 180-189: 2, 280-289:3, 380-389:4, and 480-488:5. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, and the fifth contributes 9. So, total in tens place: (4*10) + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place, I can calculate this as follows: The total number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, does 488 have a units digit of 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within the 488 pages. So, 48 times is correct for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another range, contributing 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers have exactly one 8 in the units place, the number of such occurrences is 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is included in the 48th group (480-488). So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's check each range. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is a partial range. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for this range. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (4*10=40) plus 9, so 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify each part again.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) each contributing 10, so 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89\nTotal: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each 10, so 40, plus 480-488 which is 9, so 40+9=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48+49=97.

    "text": " So, the number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10 and taking the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But actually, the last page is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, that seems correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens place 4 occurs 10 times. So, for the first 400 pages, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each complete set of 100 has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, for the first 400 pages, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1 = 4, the common difference d = 10, and the last term an = 484. The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is an = a1 + (n - 1)d. Plugging in the values: 484 = 4 + (n - 1)*10. Subtract 4 from both sides: 480 = (n - 1)*10. Divide both sides by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. That means 4 appears 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the last page, which is 488. So, does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count them. From 40-49: 10 pages. From 140-149: another 10. From 240-249: another 10. From 340-349: another 10. From 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. How many terms? Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: an = a1 + (n - 1)d. 488 = 8 + (n - 1)*10. Subtract 8: 480 = (n - 1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n - 1. So, n = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, let's see: From 80-89: 10 pages. From 180-189: 10. From 280-289: 10. From 380-389: 10. From 480-488: 9. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 pages, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 pages, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total pages by 10 and considering how many complete groups of 10 there are. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does the 488th page include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 5 blocks are complete. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the 8's, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which is only 9 (from 480-488). So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Since each block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place, I can calculate how many blocks there are from 1 to 488. The last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra 8 numbers, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is actually floor(488/10) = 48 times, but since 488 is included, we check if 488 has a 4 in the units place. 488's units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, actually, it's 48 times. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is the only number in that range with a 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 480 is included in the 48 sets, so 480 is the 48th 4 in the units place. Then 484 is the 49th. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds place is the third digit, so for numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? It's the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. That would be floor(488 / 10) = 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial set (481-488), 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks there are. The blocks are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place each. The last block, 480-488, has numbers 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? For the first four blocks: 4 blocks * 10 = 40. For the last block, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) (from 4 to 480).\n   - Additionally, 484 is within 481-488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block has 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - Number of blocks: 5.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) (from 8 to 480).\n   - Additionally, 488 is within 481-488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: \\( 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block except the last has 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Number of complete blocks: 4, contributing \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n   - The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers from 800-899 exist, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full groups, meaning 48 occurrences. But wait, does 488 itself have a 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with an 8. So actually, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times the 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149, that's another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So how many blocks? 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 up to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 itself is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Because the first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? Let's see: the last number is 488, which is 48*10 +8, so that's 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, another 10. 280-289: yes, another 10. 380-389: yes, another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, the block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 8's, and then 480-488 contributing 9 8's. Wait, no, 480-489 is a block, but since we only go up to 488, the tens place 8's in 480-488 are 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 =40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Wait, that's a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, checking the 4's: units place: 48, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference is quite large. Let me check again. For the 4's in the units place: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's 48 times. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block has 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct. So 187 total 4's. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. Since 488 is the 49th term (as 488=8+480, which is 8 + 48*10), so 49. Correct. Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's:98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488.

    "text": " To find the count, I can use the formula: (Last - First)/Interval + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait a second. The book ends at 488, so the last 4 in the units place is indeed at 484. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, wait again. Let me check. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, in the hundreds place, each hundred has another 10 numbers. So, 100-199: 140-149, that's 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 440 to 449 is within 488. So that's 4 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Wait, but earlier I thought 5 sets, but actually, from 40-49 is in 0-99, so that's one set, and then each hundred after that adds another set. So 0-99: 1 set, 100-199: 1 set, 200-299: 1 set, 300-399: 1 set, 400-488: 1 set. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. So 5*10=50. Hmm, I think that's correct. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be up to 488. So how many such sets are there? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would normally be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have four full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, and one partial set contributing 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, which doesn't happen here. So, the hundreds place contributes 0 times. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the number of 4's: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's: from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So total 49 in tens place. So 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, 484 is within the range. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades). Each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th decade ends at 480. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the next 4 would be at 484, which is within this range. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but actually, each full decade from 1-10, 11-20, etc., up to 480-489 (but since we're only going up to 488), so maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of numbers where the units digit is 4. The first such number is 4, then every 10 pages: 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484. To find how many terms are in this sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. So 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't include that. So how many sets are there? Let's see: from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, 440-449: the tens digit is 4 for all these numbers, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So each of these five sets contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 4's. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So total 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, then every 10 pages. The last one is 488. Using the same approach as with the 4's in units place: a_1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the book. So the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would only go up to 488. So for 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 8's, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit being 4, but the tens digit is 8. So yes, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, which is 9 numbers. So total 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 4's total: 188, 8's total: 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 8's in the tens place. The ranges are: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8's in tens place: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Units place for 8's: 49, as calculated. So 49+49=98. 4's: 188. 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484, with a common difference of 10.\n   - Using the formula for the nth term: \\(484 = 4 + (n-1) \\times 10\\), solving gives \\(n = 49\\).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\).\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488, with a common difference of 10.\n   - Using the formula for the nth term: \\(488 = 8 + (n-1) \\times 10\\), solving gives \\(n = 49\\).\n   - Total 8's in units place: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place (as the book ends at 488).\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**\n\\[188 - 98 = 90\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find the count, I can use the formula: ((Last - First) / Step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488 pages? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, in the hundreds place, only the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, let's calculate the count. ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me check each range. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: Here, the last number is 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, adding these up: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of terms in the sequence 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between consecutive terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. That's (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449? Yes, and since 488 is beyond that, so yes, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 ranges of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 9 in 480-488. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives a difference of 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but wait, 484 is the last page, which is 488, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. So that's 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 400 is the first and 488 is the last). Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the range for the hundreds place, but for the tens place, 480-489 would have the tens digit as 8, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. But wait, for the tens place, each range like 80-89 has 10 numbers, but in the hundreds place, the last range is 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, how many ranges are there? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 full ranges with 10 each and one with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 (for 480-488) = 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, the common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, ..., up to 440 to 449. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, let me check that. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. So, how many 8's in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. 180-189: 10 8's. 280-289: 10 8's. 380-389: 10 8's. 480-488: The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me recount. From 80-89: 10 8's. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10\u00d74 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I added up the 4's, I got 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I thought the answer might be different. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. So, 10\u00d74 +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. And in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n     - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n     - Each block contributes 10 '4's, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n     - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n     - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n     - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 '8's instead of 10.\n     - Total: 10 \u00d7 4 + 9 = 49\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where '8' appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - Number of '8's: 0\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms can be found by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1. That's (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10, and so on. So, how many such ranges are there? Well, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges exist. 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. So that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, does this count as part of the tens place? Let me think. When considering the tens place, any number from 480-488 has 8 in the tens place. So, how many such numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, I think I made a mistake earlier. When I was counting the tens place for 8, I only considered up to 389, but actually, there's another range from 480-488 where 8 is in the tens place. So, that's an additional 9 numbers. So, total tens place for 8 is 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 49 in total for the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm adding 9, making it 49. Hmm, let me check again. The tens place for 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the first hundred is 1-99, then 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8; the highest is 4 in 400-488. Therefore, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the tens place count because earlier I thought it was 40, then realized it's 49. But let me make sure. For the tens place, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range (9). So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). Wait, 440-449: 440,441,...,449. That's 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For the 8's, units: 8,18,...,488. That's (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

    "text": " The number of terms in this sequence can be found by dividing the total range by 10. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor would give 48. But let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so maybe 49 times? Wait, because when you count inclusive, you add 1. So, yes, 49 times in the units place for 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), then 100-199: 140-149 (10), 200-299: 240-249 (10), 300-399: 340-349 (10), and 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. Now, 488 is less than 490, so the last range would be 380-389. Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10). So, that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 doesn't have an 8 in the tens place because 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is less than 489, so 480-488 includes 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489. But since 488 is the last page, 480-488 includes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (from 480 to 488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, I think I missed that. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's an additional 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 = 40 plus 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counts. Let me verify the 4's again: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in page numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of terms: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find the total count, I can calculate how many numbers are in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence where the common difference is 10. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, and a_n = 484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Let's solve for n: 484 - 4 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but wait a second. The last page is 488, so 484 is indeed the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such hundreds are there? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but for the tens place, when the hundreds digit is 0, it's just 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 5*10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 fall within the 488-page limit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The common difference is 10. Let's find the number of terms: a_n = 488, a_1 = 8, d = 10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 488 - 8 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial set because the book ends at 488. Let's count each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: How many numbers? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 4 in this book, since the book goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. How many such groups are there? From 1-488, the tens place is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would go up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488. So that's 5 groups. Each group has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last group. The last page is 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400 to 488.

Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let's see how many full groups we have. From 1-488, the tens place is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four groups has 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last group, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. There's no page number where the hundreds digit is 8, so 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Each group of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups would give 48 4's. But wait, the last group might not be complete. The last page is 488, which is in the 48th group (since 48*10 = 480). So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, making it 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, contributing 89 4's. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place 48, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is in the 48th group (since 48*10=480), and 488 is the last page. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 8 appears 48 times (since 488 is included). Wait, but 488 is the 48th group, so 48*10=480, and 488 is 8 more than 480, so the 8 in units place is at 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 1-488, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Wait, but does 480-489 include 488? Well, 480-489 would be another range, but 488 is included, so that's another range. Wait, 480-489 would be the fifth range. But 488 is within 480-489, so yes, that's another 10 8's in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488? No, 480-489 is up to 489, but our book ends at 488. So, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 would still be 10 times? Wait, no. Let me think. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all those numbers, right? Because 480 is 480, 481, ..., up to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488, not 10. So, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 ranges, but actually, it's 5 ranges, with the last one being only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units place 48, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's = 48 + 49 = 97. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, total 8's: 48 (units) +49 (tens)=97. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's are 97. So, the difference is 187 -97=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence, since 484=4 + (n-1)*10 => n= (484-4)/10 +1=48+1=49? Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, it's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, which is >=4, so total 48 +1=49. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because 488 is included, which is 488, so the units digit 8 is included, but for 4's, the last 4 in units place is 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place 4's:49. Similarly, for tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc. Each contributes 10 4's. How many such ranges? From 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 4's, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 ranges. So, 50 4's in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in hundreds place. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Wait, earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me recount. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, correct total is 188 4's. Now, for 8's: units place: from 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the 488 adds another 8 in units place. So, 48+1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Because 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears 49 times. Wait, let me confirm. The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 pages: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place 8's:49. Tens place: as before, 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last range contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place 8's:49. Hundreds place:0. So total 8's:49+49=98. Wait, so earlier I had 97, but now it's 98. Let me check again. Units place:49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I have 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with 4 in tens place. Similarly, 140-149, etc. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (40-49), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. And 440-449 is within 488, so yes, included. So, 50 4's in tens place. Similarly, for 8's, the tens place ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in tens place. Units place for 8's:49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, step 10).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can subtract 4 from 484 and divide by 10, then add 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, then 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each have 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 5 sets are valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? Subtract 8 from 488: 488 - 8 = 480. Divide by 10: 480/10 = 48. Add 1: 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many sets. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, so in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then an additional 9 in 480-488. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find the count, I can calculate how many numbers are in this sequence. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? The first is 400, and the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 400) + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me check each range: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The nth term can be found using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, a_n = 484. Plugging in: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, I need to find how many such blocks there are within 488 pages. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. The next block is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is still within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. However, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within the book. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many pages are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many terms there are. The first term is 8, last term is 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. Using the nth term formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's. Let's see how many such blocks there are within 488. The first block is 80-89, which is within 1-99. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the block is only up to 488. So, the block 480-488. How many 8's in the tens place here? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these pages, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but when I consider the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, but the last block is only 9 numbers. So, normally, each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last one only contributes 9. Let me recount. The blocks are: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks and 1 partial block. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but earlier when I counted the units place, it was 49. Hmm, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I should think of the tens place as follows: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so each hundred has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought the hundreds place would contribute 0, but let me make sure. Wait, from 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, the hundreds digit is never 8, so yes, 0 times. So, total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The total number can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But the last group would end at 480, so the 48th group is 480, and then 484 is the next occurrence. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The number of 4's in the units place can be calculated as the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, every 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. So, 48 times 1 equals 48. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, because 480 is included in the 48 sets, so 480 is the 48th set. Then, 484 is the next one, which is in the 481-490 range, but since the book ends at 488, 484 is included. So, yes, that's 49. Wait, no, because 480 is the 48th set, so from 1 to 480, we have 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, 484 is another one, so total is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. Let's see: 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) 100-199: 140-149 (10) 200-299: 240-249 (10) 300-399: 340-349 (10) 400-488: 440-449 (10) So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check again. Wait, from units place, I thought it was 49, but let me recount that. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the 481-490 range, which is the 49th cycle, we have 484, which is another 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, there's an 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the 481-490 range, 488 is the last number, which is 488, so units digit 8. So, that's another one, making it 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many full ranges are there? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) 100-199: 180-189 (10) 200-299: 280-289 (10) 300-399: 380-389 (10) 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last one) So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 8's, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find the count, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, the last occurrence is at 484, which is the 48th set. So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's actually 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is given by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. Each block has 10 numbers where 8 is in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So total in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lceil \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rceil = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page. Let me check: 484 is the last page where 4 appears in the units place. So from 4 to 484, that's 48 times (since 484 is the 48th occurrence). Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) // 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48 * 10 + 4. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let me count how many full decades there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in 1-488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. Each decade has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, does that mean 48 times or 49? Let me check: from 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many full decades: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's. Let me check again. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's 49 times, not 48. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, for 4's in the units place, it's 49 times, not 48. So that changes things. Let me recalculate. 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 4's: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, so I think I initially missed that the units place for 4's has 49 occurrences, not 48. So the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Let me confirm again. For units place of 4's: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times. So 4's total is 49+50+89=188. 8's total is 49+49=98. So difference is 188-98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. And for 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times, plus the other four decades each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90.

    "text": " To find the total number, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part, then see how many complete sets of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets. But wait, the last set ends at 480, and then 484 is another occurrence. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's calculate it as follows: The first occurrence is at 4, and the last is at 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488. So, let's see: The first block (1-100) has 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The second block (101-200) has 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 is 10, and 340-349 is 10. Now, 440-449 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, 440-449 is within 1-488, so yes, 40 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10. So total is 40 +10=50. Hmm, that makes sense. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 -400 +1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89= 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, let's calculate: Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences, which I added to the 40 from the earlier blocks, making 49. So, yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the difference is 90. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The number of terms can be found by taking the difference between 484 and 4, then dividing by 10, and adding 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many full sets of 100 there are in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (100-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, etc.), so 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, check if 440-449 is within the 488 limit. 449 is less than 488, so that's another 10, making it 50. Then, from 450-488, the tens digit doesn't go back to 4, so no more. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. How many full hundreds are there? Up to 380-389, which is within 488. 4 hundreds would mean 4 sets, but wait, 400-488 is the fourth hundred, but the tens digit in 400-488 only goes up to 8 in 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. But 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let me correct this. For the tens place, the 8's occur in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up units and tens places: 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can use the formula: number of times = (last occurrence - first occurrence) / interval + 1. Here, last occurrence is 484, first is 4, interval is 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is correct. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of the book. Wait, but for the tens place, let's see. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let me see: 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, is that accurate? Let me check. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. Similarly, 140-149: 10 numbers, 4 in tens place. Same for 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? It's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is actually 188? Let me check: 99 + 89 is 188, yes. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, first occurrence is 8, last is 488. Number of times: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, wait. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in terms of the tens place, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) has 9 occurrences. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 4\u00d710 = 40, plus 9 gives 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

The number of occurrences is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** \\(49 + 49 = 98\\)\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   \\[\n   188 \\text{ (number of 4's)} - 98 \\text{ (number of 8's)} = 90\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate the number of terms in this sequence. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The common difference is 10. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 = 4, d = 10, and a_n = 484. Plugging in: 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n = 49. So, 4 appears 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 times.

Let me count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, which is correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The first number is 400, and the last is 488. The number of terms is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: 10 times. 280-289: 10 times. 380-389: 10 times. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 times. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) \u2192 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Ranges with 10 occurrences: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 ranges, 10 each).\n   - Range 480-488 contributes 9 times.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of terms in the sequence 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the last term, so let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? 484 is 4 + 10*(n-1) where n is the number of terms. 484 = 4 + 10n - 10 \u2192 484 = 10n - 6 \u2192 10n = 490 \u2192 n = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such blocks there are. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, that's another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there up to 488? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, page numbers start from 1, so the first block is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 488? 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 5 blocks are valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The number of terms is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence of 8 in the units place is 488. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me confirm: each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 times, so that's 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total 40+9=49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number starting from 4, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number starting from 8, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place is calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, there are 48 complete groups, each with a 4 in the units place, and then the 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, that's 49 times. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the integer division of 488 by 10, which is 48, plus 1 if the last page number is 484, which it is. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. The last group goes up to 480, and then 481-488. In 481-488, the units digit is 4 at 484. So, that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks is that? From 1-99: 1 block, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does the last block go up to 449? Yes, because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1-488, the first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of 8's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. The last group ends at 480, and then 481-488 includes 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's incomplete. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, but only 9 numbers. So, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place here. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-399) plus 9 from 400-488. That's 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for 8's? From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct. And in the units place, it's 49 because 488 is included. So, yes, 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds. So, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's printed is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " To find the total count, I can calculate how many numbers are in this sequence. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set in the hundreds place is 440-449, which is within 488. Let me count each of these ranges: - 40-49: that's 10 numbers. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? The first number is 400, and the last is 488. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10 because 488 is the last page. So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only be 8 if the number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by considering how many sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th set. But actually, 488 is the 49th set because 480-489 is the 49th set, but since we only go up to 488, the units place 4's go up to 484. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is indeed in the 48th decade. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 numbers. Let's see: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers Now, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me confirm. From 40-49: 10 pages. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Hmm, wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48. Tens place: Every 100 numbers, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 48 numbers. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's see: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: 9 numbers). So, the tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place: 48, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total: 48+49=97. Correct. So, 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? For 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For 8's, since the book ends at 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0. Units place: 48 for both 4 and 8? Wait, no. For 4's in units place, it's up to 484, which is the 48th set. For 8's in units place, it's up to 488, which is the 48th set as well. So, 48 for both. But in the tens place, for 4's, we had 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50. For 8's, we had 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 49. So, 50 vs 49. So, the difference comes from the tens place. So, 50 - 49 = 1, and the hundreds place adds 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. So, total difference is 89 +1 =90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, so 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100, except the last block (480-488), which has 9 numbers. So, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " The total number of 4's in the units place can be calculated by seeing how many groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th group (since 48*10=480, and 484 is within that). So, that's 48 occurrences. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But actually, when you have 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see how many blocks: 80-89 is one block, 180-189 another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, for 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include the 4 in the units place? Yes, because 484 is the last one. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 occurs at 4, 14, ..., 484. Let me count how many terms that is. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete sets of these ranges are within 488. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149 (10), third is 240-249 (10), fourth is 340-349 (10), and fifth is 440-449 (10). Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4, so from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first occurrence is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set has 10 numbers. Let's see how many sets are within 488. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), second is 180-189 (10), third is 280-289 (10), fourth is 380-389 (10). The next set would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 range is partial. So, how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place? The tens digit is 8, so 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and one partial set (480-488) contributing 9. So, total in tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that. 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so yes, that's 9.

So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence approach: a_1 = 8, d = 10, a_n = 488. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count these. The first set is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: let me confirm. The first four sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The fifth set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
