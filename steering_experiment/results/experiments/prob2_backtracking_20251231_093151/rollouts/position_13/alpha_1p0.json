    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, 488 ends with an 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? Let me see: 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 49 numbers (since 4 to 484 includes both endpoints). Wait, no. Wait, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full decades we have. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, all numbers from 400 to 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. The last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, the first four ranges give 10 each, and the last gives 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear. This is 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. The numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149: another 10. 201-300: 240-249: 10. 301-400: 340-349: 10. 401-488: 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, each hundred contributes 10, and we have 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). But wait, 401-488 is only part of the 401-500 range, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is still fully within 401-488. So, 4 sets of 10, which is 4*10=40. Wait, but let me check: 1-100: 40-49: 10. 101-200:140-149:10. 201-300:240-249:10. 301-400:340-349:10. 401-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, but wait, 401-488 is part of the 400-499 range, so maybe I should think of it as 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488, which is another 88 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? For each hundred, 10 times. So, 1-400: 4 sets of 10, so 40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50. Wait, but wait, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, the tens digit 4 appears 5 times 10, which is 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. From 1-400, that's 4 sets, so 40. Then, 401-488: 440-449, which is another 10. So total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The last number is 488, so the sequence is 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each. From 1-100: 80-89:10 numbers. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 1-100:80-89:10. 101-200:180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me check again. 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages don't reach 800.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last set would be from 480 to 488. So, 484 is included, which is the 48th set. So, that's 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, which is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, that's 48 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the ranges are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, there's no page number where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 97 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For eights: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 48. So, 97 eights. So, 187-97=90. Wait, but when I think about it, from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit for 4's is up to 488, which is 89 numbers. But for 8's, the hundreds digit never occurs. So, that's correct. Wait, but let me think about the units place for 8's. Is it 48? From 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so the 48th 8 is at 488, which is correct. So, yes, 48. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of ranges: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last range (440-449) which is fully included.  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of pages: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).  \n   - Number of 4's: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 48 \\) (units) + \\( 50 \\) (tens) + \\( 89 \\) (hundreds) = \\( 187 \\) 4's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers except the last range (480-488), which has 9 numbers.  \n   - Number of ranges: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 48 \\) (units) + \\( 49 \\) (tens) + \\( 0 \\) (hundreds) = \\( 97 \\) 8's.\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 187 \\) (number of 4's) - \\( 97 \\) (number of 8's) = \\( 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. The pattern is every 10 numbers, so 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be found by dividing 488 by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full decades, but wait, 488 is the last number, which is 48*10 + 8, so actually, the units digit cycles 48 full times, but since 488 is the last page, the units digit goes up to 8. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times, right? Wait, no, because each decade (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 is also included, but the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so the 4's in the tens place are only up to 449. So, how many such decades are there? Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are four such blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, no, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This happens in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, but since 488 ends with 8, that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, no: actually, for each 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 exactly once. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times 8 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's another 8, making it 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The difference between terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: How many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). But the tens digit is 8, so each of these has 8 in the tens place. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This happens in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I counted the 4's, I got 187, and the 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 8's in the tens place. The ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, correct.\n- 180-189: 10, correct.\n- 280-289: 10, correct.\n- 380-389: 10, correct.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, 10\u00d74 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49, as we have 8, 18, ..., 488, which is 49 numbers.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 187.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, n-1 = (484 -4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, so n=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this suggests 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term because starting at 4 as the first term. So, units place 4's: 49. But earlier, I thought it was 48 because from 1-480, which is 480 numbers, 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. But 484 is within 480-488, so it's the 49th occurrence. So, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page. So, the units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The difference is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710 =50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units was 48, but now I'm seeing it's 49. So, that changes the total.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 98.\n\nSo, 4's total: 188, 8's total:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting a different answer because I corrected the units place for 4's from 48 to 49.\n\nLet me double-check:\n\nUnits place for 4's: starting at 4, each 10 numbers. Last occurrence is 484, which is within 488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1 = ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8's: last term is 488, so ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place for 4's:49, units for 8's:49.\n\nTens place for 4's:5 blocks \u00d710=50.\n\nTens place for 8's:5 blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 90. But earlier I thought it was 89 because I had miscounted the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188.\n- 8's: units=49, tens=49. Total=98.\n- Difference=188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to ensure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4's: from 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers, correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50, correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49, as calculated.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49, correct.\n\nTens place:80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 10\u00d74 +9=49, correct.\n\nHundreds place:0, correct.\n\nSo, 4's total:188, 8's total:98, difference:90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see, from 0 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10 = 480, so 484 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. Let me calculate it properly. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus the 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the number of numbers ending with 4 is 48 full tens (1-480) which gives 48, and then 484 is the 49th. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 4's. Similarly, in 100-199, 140-149 is another, contributing another 10. Then 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 400-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488, so from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 488 itself, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be the next range, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 10 each, and 480-488 contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 484 is the last one before 488, so yes, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 ends with an 8, not a 4. So, actually, the units place 4's go up to 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's see: Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers each. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges * 10 + 1 range * 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so total count would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but actually, the last number ending with 4 is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full sets, meaning 48 numbers ending with 4. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is 488, which ends with 8, not 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such decades are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many sets is that? Each set is 100 numbers, so from 0-400, we have 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the 440-449 is within that. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, 5 hundreds in total. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 5 x 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, let's check: starting from 8, the last number is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these decades has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such decades there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 set of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, no, let me clarify. Each hundred (except the last one) has a full decade where the tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount. In the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems correct. Units place for 4's:48, because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Units place for 8's:49 because 488 is included, so 49 numbers. So, yes, 187-98=89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds digit for numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let's see, from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Since it's every 10 numbers, the count would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, that's 49 numbers. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, for each page number, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade (pages 481-488), we check if 4 appears in the units place. The units digits go from 1 to 8 in this case, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 484 is the last 4 in the units place, which is correct, so 48 complete decades (each giving one 4) plus one more in the incomplete decade, so 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, in the case of 440-449, that's within 488, so that's valid. Let's count how many such decades there are. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred is only up to 488. So, the decades where the tens digit is 4 are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, that's 5 decades, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 decades, 10 each, so 50. But wait, is that correct? Let me think: from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be pages 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, which is 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such decades there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four decades, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is pages 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 only up to 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, that's a bit different. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full decades and one partial decade. So, total tens place 8's: (4*10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was four decades, but now I'm seeing an extra 9 in the partial decade. So, total 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 pages, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 occurs in 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 times. So, 48 occurrences. But wait, 484 is 484, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, each of these ranges contributes 10, and how many ranges are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 ranges. So, 5 times 10 is 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 minus 400 plus 1 is 89 numbers. But wait, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add those up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last page is 488, so the units digit 8 occurs in 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, because 8*1=8, 8*2=16? No, wait, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, how many 8's in units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8*61? Wait, no, 8*61 is 488? Wait, 8*60 is 480, plus 8 is 488, so yes, 61st term. Wait, but that's not correct because 8 is the first term, so 8 is 8*1, 18 is 8*2 + 2? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many numbers between 1 and 488 have 8 in the units place. So, every 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last partial set which is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8. So, total 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: this is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, number of 4's was 187, and number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49? Wait, earlier I thought 48, but now this calculation says 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, when I calculated units place for 4's, I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because from 4 to 484, inclusive, stepping by 10, is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, I think I was wrong earlier; it's 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., each contributes 10, and there are 5 such ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. So, 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99+89=188. Wait, so earlier I thought 187, but now it's 188. Hmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me check where. When I first calculated units place, I thought 48, but actually it's 49. So, 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the units place. It's actually 49, not 48. So, the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 4's. So, starting at 4, then 14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? Let's see: 4 +10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, yes, 49 terms.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8 +10*(n-1)=488. 10*(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 terms.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, the book has 488 pages, so page 488 exists. So, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is correct, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but that was because I miscalculated the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4.

Wait, but 480 to 489 is the 49th block, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 480-488 range, the numbers ending with 4 are 484. So, that's one more. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484), totaling 49. Wait, but let me check that. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 includes 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, because 4,14,...,484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 4 is the first occurrence, then 14 is the second, and so on. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the number of numbers ending with 4 is equal to the floor of (488 + 1)/10. Wait, that might not be the right formula. Alternatively, the number is equal to how many times 4 appears in the units place, which is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, that means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete decade (481-488), we check if 4 is present. The numbers are 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 484 ends with 4, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 450-488 is beyond that. So, how many such blocks are there? Each block is 100 numbers, and within each block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many blocks have the tens digit as 4? Let's see: 40-49: that's one block, 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. From 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Okay, so tens place gives 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, but for 8's. So, numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. How many? Let's see. Every 10 numbers, there's one ending with 8. So, 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and in the incomplete decade (481-488), 488 ends with 8, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me count again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, tens digit 8. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, tens place gives 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the tens place, 4's: from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, totaling 50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49. Because from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4, so 48 full decades (48*10=480), plus 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number. Let me see if I can find another way to count, maybe using a formula.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, earlier I had 49. Hmm, maybe the formula is different. Wait, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(n/10). But if the units digit of n is >= d, then we add 1. So, for 4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48. Since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1, making it 49. Similarly for 8's: floor(488/10)=48. Since 8<=8, add 1, making it 49. So that's correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated by:\n\nLet higher = n / 100\n\ncurrent = (n / 10) % 10\n\nlower = n % 10\n\nIf current > d: count += (higher + 1) * 10\n\nIf current == d: count += (higher) * 10 + lower + 1\n\nIf current < d: count += higher * 10\n\nSo, applying this for 4's in tens place:\n\nn = 488\n\nhigher = 488 / 100 = 4 (integer division)\n\ncurrent = (488 / 10) % 10 = 48 %10 = 8\n\nlower = 488 %10 = 8\n\nd =4\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count += (higher +1)*10 = (4+1)*10=50\n\nSo, 50 fours in the tens place, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nd=8\n\ncurrent=8, which is equal to d.\n\nSo, count += higher *10 + lower +1 = 4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49\n\nWhich also matches my earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's, d=4.\n\nhigher = 488 / 1000=0\n\ncurrent = (488 / 100) %10=4\n\nlower = 488 %100=88\n\nSince current >=d, count += (higher)*100 + (lower +1) if current >d, else (lower +1) if current ==d.\n\nWait, the formula is a bit more involved. Alternatively, for hundreds place, the number of times d appears is:\n\nIf n >= 100*d, then count += (n - 100*d +1)\n\nBut since d=4, 100*4=400. So, from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in hundreds place, since 800 >488, there are 0.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of fours is 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\nAnd the total number of eights is 49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can use the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence: n = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. Here, first term is 4, last term is 484, common difference is 10. So, n = ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, that's five ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's see, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference is 10. So, n = ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 400-488, so that's valid. Let's count the number of ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's five ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the first four ranges, 4 * 10 = 40, and the last range contributes 9 8's. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's, totaling \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers from 400 to 488: \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges contribute \\(4 \\times 10 = 40\\), and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\(40 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\(49 + 49 = 98\\).\n\n**Difference:** \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place. Since every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) and then a partial cycle of 8 numbers (481-488). But in each full cycle, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last time 4 appears in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 includes the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, the last hundred is 401-500, but we only go up to 488, so in 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 401-410, 420-430, etc., but wait, that's not correct. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, in each hundred, it's 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, which we've already counted in the 400s. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Each hundred has 10 numbers with the tens digit as 4. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). Then, 401-488: 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-499 would be another 10, but since we're only going up to 488, we have 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total is 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400: 40 numbers (4 sets of 10). From 401-488: 10 numbers. So total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1-488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the partial decade from 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the 400-488 range. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one if we don't reach 490. So, from 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, so in 480-488, it's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 full decades in 488 pages, each contributing one '4' in the units place. Additionally, 484 is the last occurrence, so total units place '4's: 48.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, actually, the last group would be 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 1 to 484, how many 4's in units place? 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so maybe I should check how many 4's are there in the units place up to 488. Let me think differently. For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. The number of tens in 488 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that affect the count? Let me check. The last page is 488, which is in the 48th ten (480-489). So, in the 48th ten, the units digits go from 0 to 8 (since we only go up to 488). So, in the 48th ten, the units digit 4 would be at 484, which is within 480-488. So, yes, 48 times. So, units place: 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, the blocks are 40-49 (in the 0-99 range), 140-149 (100-199), 240-249 (200-299), 340-349 (300-399), and 440-449 (400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's a full block. So, how many blocks? Let's count: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, and it's an 8 in the units place, so that's included in the 48th group. So, units place: 48 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. 8 is higher than 4, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. So, 97 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place:0. Total: 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, that's a big difference. But let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the tens place for 4's. I had 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. That seems right. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Units place: for both 4 and 8, it's 48 each, because up to 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8. But wait, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481-488 adds 8 more numbers, but the 8 in units place is only counted once per group. Wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10, so 488 is the 48th group plus 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the number of 8's is 48 (from each group) plus one more because 488 has an 8. Wait, no, because 488 is part of the 48th group? Wait, 1-10: group 1, 11-20: group 2, ..., 481-490 would be group 49, but our book stops at 488. So, in group 49, we have 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, how many 8's are there? Each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, group 1:8, group 2:18,..., group 48:488. Wait, group 48 would be 471-480, right? Because group 1 is 1-10, group 2 is 11-20,..., group 48 is 471-480. Then group 49 would be 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in group 49, the units digits go from 1-8, so the 8 in units place would be at 488. So, in the units place, we have 48 full groups (1-480) each contributing one 8, plus one more in group 49 (488). So, total units place for 8's is 48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me clarify. Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I had 48. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought units place for 8's was 48, but actually, it's 49. Because the last group (481-488) includes 488, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, units place for 8's: 49. Similarly, for 4's in the units place, let's check. From 1-480, 48 groups, each contributing one 4 in units place, so 48 fours. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4 in the units place. So, units place for 4's remains 48. So, earlier, I had 48 fours in units place, which is correct. So, correcting the 8's: units place is 49, not 48. So, now, let's recalculate the total number of 8's. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Earlier, I had 97, but now it's 98. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check again. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. For 4's: units:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total:48+50=98+89=187. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, the number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 89. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place for 8's was 48, but it's actually 49. So, I had initially calculated 97 eights, but it's actually 98. So, the correct difference is 187-98=89. Hmm, so I need to adjust my earlier count. Let me go through it again carefully. **Counting 4's:**\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484=4+10*(n-1). Solving for n: 484=4+10n-10 => 484=10n-6 => 10n=490 => n=49. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Wait, this contradicts my earlier thought. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4. But in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is in this incomplete decade. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place for 4's:48+1=49. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's also 49. So, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences in the units place. That makes more sense. So, correcting my earlier mistake, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. So, let's recast the counts:\n\n**4's:**\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 187. So, now, I'm confused. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let's recount the 4's in the units place. From 1-488, the numbers ending with 4 are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 4's is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: numbers ending with 8 are 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 8's is 49.\n\nSo, both units places have 49 each.\n\nNow, tens place for 4's: as before, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks x10=50. So, tens place for 4's is 50.\n\nTens place for 8's:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, the last block has 9 (480-488). So, 4x10=40 +9=49. So, tens place for 8's is 49.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit doesn't reach 8. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. Hmm, seems like I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me add again:\n\n4's:49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't double count anything. Each digit position is independent, so units, tens, hundreds are separate. So, the counts should be additive. So, 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98. 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n\nI think earlier I made a mistake in counting the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49, which threw off the total. After correcting that, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \n   Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block (480-488) has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "num_tokens": 4886,
    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, the first number is 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find how many terms there are, I can subtract 4 from 484, which gives 480, then divide by 10 to get 48, then add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term because starting at 4, each step is +10. Let me check: 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range, then 140-149 is another, 240-249 another, 340-349 another, and 440-449 another. So that's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, 449 is okay because 449 < 488. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds place is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's 89 numbers, right? So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's included. Let me find how many terms there are. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: that's one, 180-189 another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another. That's 4 ranges. So, 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 40 + 0 = 89 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 40\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 40 = 89. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 89 = 99. So, 99 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 40. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, which seems correct because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except maybe the last set? Wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. Similarly, 484 is the 49th 4 in the units place. So that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the answer is 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\nThe digit 4 is printed 99 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last number with 4 in the units place. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, but wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So in each set, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one block. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5*10=50. But wait, is that correct? Let me check. The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 blocks, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. So, 488/10=48 full sets, with 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, 8 appears once, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check. Each block is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-489: but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488: that's 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? The first four blocks are full (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total 8's in tens place: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) do not include a 4 in the units place.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one 8 (at 488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in a 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is page 484, which is within 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 4 to 484, that's every 10th number. So, the number of 4's in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the last one, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many complete ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: the first is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. Wait, actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 89 times. So, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so let's see how many 8's are in the units place. The first is 8, then 18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 complete ranges (each giving 10 8's) and one partial range giving 9 8's. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place \u2192 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since it's every 10 numbers, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's calculate: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does 488 itself have a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so no. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but let's check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of tens in 488, which is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens). So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (40s), then 140-149 (140s), 240-249 (240s), 340-349 (340s), and 440-449 (440s). That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, 5 ranges x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Again, from 1 to 488, each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. But wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's the 48th group plus one more. So, does that mean 49 times? Let me check: from 1-10: 8 is once, 11-20: 18 is once, ..., 481-490: 488 is once. Wait, but 488 is within 481-490, so yes, that's the 48th group, but since 488 is the last number, it's included. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the 488th page, so in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many 8's? Let's see: the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. So, it's floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the last digit is >=8. Wait, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so floor is 48. But since the last number is 488, which ends with 8, we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total 4 full ranges and one partial. Each full range contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last partial contributes 9 8's (from 480 to 488). So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10 8's in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, so the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms are in this sequence? The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). The last term is 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 terms, which matches my earlier count. So, 49 8's in units place. Tens place: as above, 49. So, total 98 8's. 4's:187. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 4's in hundreds place. That seems correct. So, 187 total 4's, 98 total 8's. Difference is 89. So, the answer is 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times (5 ranges \u00d7 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times (4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 for 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Since every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so the last group is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the last number with a 4 in the units place is 484. So actually, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Let me think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in 1 to 488. So, starting from 4, every 10th number. The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term because starting from 4 as the first. Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such decades there are up to 488. The decades are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five decades. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 decades * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book has 488 pages, 440-449 is within 1-488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add them up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place appears in decades 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many full decades there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 decades with 10 each and one with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, total number of 4's in units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's actually 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 full tens and then 8 more numbers. So, in the units place, the 4 appears 48 times, right? Because 488 is the 48th group of 10 plus 8, but the 4 in the units place occurs at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, starting at 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The last one is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, so 480 / 10 = 48. So, 48 times. So, units place: 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So, that's 5 ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last range. 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of fours is 187. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Starting at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last one is 488. So, the number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, because 8 is the first, then every 10 after that. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, let's see how many such ranges are there. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check again. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit can be 4 or lower. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total 98 eights. Now, earlier, I found that the number of fours is 187. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me go through that again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: from 1 to 488, numbers ending with 4: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49? Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Wait, no, let me check. 484 is the last number ending with 4 before 488. So, starting at 4, each 10 numbers adds another 4 in the units place. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: 4 is the first term, then 14 is the second, and so on. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, there are 49 fours in the units place. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place for fours: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place: ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, tens place: 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial count. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by not including the 484 in the units place. So, the correct count for fours is 188.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, which is included. So, number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. As before, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount the fours.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484,494? Wait, no, 488 is the last page. So, 494 is beyond 488, so the last one is 484. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 fours.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. So, 5 ranges, 10 each: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: total 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place for fours.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page. So, 484 is the last number ending with 4 before 488. So, 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? Starting at 4, each step of 10. So, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place:49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, units place:8,18,...,488. So, 488 is included. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nTens place for eights:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nFours:49+50+89=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but the initial problem was to find how many more 4's than 8's. So, 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for fours. From 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. Since the book has 488 pages, the last page with 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so there are 48 full groups of 10, but wait, starting from 4, the first group is 4-13, then 14-23, and so on. Wait, maybe a better way is to think that in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? That's 48 full blocks (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each block, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 times, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, but let me check: starting from 1, the first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me calculate how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, pages 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times. The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The number of such numbers is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-489: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488? Wait, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488. So, yes, 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, the blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block contributes 10, so up to 380-389, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9 =49. Yes, correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles and then 8 extra numbers. In each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more (484). So total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let me see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check. From 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 full cycles. In each cycle, 8 appears once. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks. Each full block is 10 numbers, so 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4*10=40. Now, check if there's a partial block beyond that. The next block would be 480-489, but the book stops at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, let me verify. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times. 180-189: another 10, so total 20. 280-289: another 10, total 30. 380-389: another 10, total 40. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The numbers go from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. So, the number of times is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th term, so that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let me count how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. 240-249, another 10. 340-349, another 10. And 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each set is 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let me count how many sets there are. Starting from 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And then 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total in tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, 3 for 300-399, 2 for 200-299, 1 for 100-199, and 0 for 1-99. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is a three-digit number. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me see: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of tens in 488, which is 48 full tens (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times). But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? Let's see: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included. So, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, so that's 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full times, but the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place. So, ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 numbers, and the last one contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. That's correct. For the tens place of 8's, I had 5 ranges, but the last one was only 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place for 8's: from 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see: 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 187-98=89.

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set would end at 480, and then 481-488 would be the next set, but only up to 488. So, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48. Wait, but let me check that. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is how many times 4 is the units digit. So, starting at 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_1=4, d=10, a_n=484. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 4: 480 = (n-1)*10. Divide by 10: 48 = n-1. So, n=49. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake earlier. Because 488 is included, but 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, etc. How many such sets are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 1-99: 10 numbers (40-49) 100-199: 10 numbers (140-149) 200-299: 10 numbers (240-249) 300-399: 10 numbers (340-349) 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 would have the tens digit as 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place beyond 449. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, let me check. From 1-99: 10 numbers. 100-199: 10. 200-299:10. 300-399:10. 400-488: 440-449 is 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So total in the tens place is 10 (from 1-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+10 (400-488)=50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. So total 4's:49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the first term is 8, last term is 488. Using the formula for the nth term: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d. Here, a_1=8, d=10, a_n=488. So, 488=8 + (n-1)*10. Subtract 8: 480=(n-1)*10. Divide by 10:48=n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers:480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (e.g., 1-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So: 1-99:80-89 (10 numbers) 100-199:180-189 (10) 200-299:280-289 (10) 300-399:380-389 (10) 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in the tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred has 10 such numbers; total hundreds considered: 5 (1-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred has 10 such numbers, except the last which has 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (as pages go up to 488).\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 times. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, does the 48th set end at 480, and then 481-488 would be the next set, but in that last partial set, 484 is included, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from 484), making it 49 times. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the 49th ten, which is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, only 481-488, so in this range, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, in the last partial set, 481-488, 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), but each of these has an 8 in the tens place. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's an additional 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times the 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 4,14,...484. Since 484 is the last one, how many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, each contributing a 4 in the units place, and then one more in 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49, correct.\n\nTens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems high, but I think it's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, 484 contributes one more, totaling 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets, plus 488, totaling 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 eights. There are 4 such ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), totaling 40 eights. Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, making a total of 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, the numbers would be 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94, 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194, 204, 214, 224, 234, 244, 254, 264, 274, 284, 294, 304, 314, 324, 334, 344, 354, 364, 374, 384, 394, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Let me count how many numbers that is. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so that's 484 / 10 = 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, I think it's 48 times, but wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check. The first 4 is at 4, which is the 1st occurrence, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on. So, 484 would be the 48th occurrence because 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear as the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, but 440 is the first one, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as the second digit. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. But wait, does 480-489 exist? The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. So, in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-489 is a range where the tens digit is 8, but the book only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But wait, in the tens place, when we're looking at the second digit, 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, for the tens place, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is included. 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that can't be right because 187 - 98 is 89, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. That also seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 187-98=89. Wait, but I feel like that might not be right because when I think about it, 4 appears more in the hundreds place, which would make sense why there are more 4's. But let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to check is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately again. Alternatively, maybe I should use a formula or a different approach to cross-verify. Let me try another method for counting digits. The total number of digits from 1 to 488 can be calculated, but that's not necessary here. Instead, for each digit position, we can calculate how many times a digit appears. For the units place: For any digit d (except maybe the last few if the total isn't a multiple of 10), each digit from 0-9 appears equally. But since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the units digit will have some extra counts. Similarly for tens and hundreds places. But perhaps it's easier to stick with the method I used earlier. Let me recount the 4's: units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 484 /10 = 48.4, but since we include both ends, it's 48 times? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, from 4 to 484 inclusive, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. Because 4 is the first, 14 is the second, and 484 is the 49th. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. That changes things. Similarly, for the tens place, I had 50, but let me check again. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. That's correct. For the hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, as before. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, so earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me confirm: units place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, for the 8's: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, now, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so I initially thought 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90. Hmm, that makes sense because I had miscounted the units place for 4's earlier. So, the correct difference is 90. Let me just make sure I didn't make any other mistakes. So, units place for 4's: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's:188. Units place for 8's:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, starting from 4, the next is 14, so up to 484, which is 48 times. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is 4 in the hundreds place, but the units digit is 8, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is indeed 48. Because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such decades there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10) So that's 5 decades, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. The numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours printed. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, meaning 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so does that add an extra? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so 49th. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let me think: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48 times, and then from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once more at 488. So, total is 48 +1 =49. Wait, but 488 is included, so the count is 49. Alternatively, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1 more, making it 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 (10) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, for 400-488, it's 9 numbers, not 10. So, total in tens place: 4 decades with 10 each, and 1 with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 (400-488) and 0-3 for the lower pages. So, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? No, because 800-899 would be needed for that, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, the number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 89 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part. Wait, but 488 is included, so let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, but since each group contributes exactly one 4 in the units place, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place. 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 itself is included, so does that add another 8? Let me check: the units digit cycles every 10, so 488 is the 48th group plus one more? Wait, no, because 488 is the 48th group's last number. Wait, 1-10: 8 is in 8. 11-20: 18. ... 481-490: 488 is in this group, so 488 is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens place 8 would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8 occurs in 4 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, and 480-488 contributing 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488 \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so up to 480, there are 48 sets, each with a 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in 484. So that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 48*10=480, and 480+4=484, which is within 488, so yes, 48 full sets plus one more, making it 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (pages 40-49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, I need to do the same for 8's. Let me go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 48*10=480, and 480 +8=488, which is within the range. So, 48 full sets, each with a 8 in the units place. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's printed are 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48 + 49 is 97. So, 188 - 97 is indeed 91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Since every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, the number of 4's in the units place is the total number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 complete decades. Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), does 484 end with a 4? Yes, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's okay. So 5 blocks, 10 each, total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), does 488 end with an 8? Yes, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. That would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count how many such blocks. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, the first four blocks are complete (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. That's 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 more. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero occurrences here. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98.

But wait, 48*10 is 480, so the next number ending with 4 is 484, which is within 488. So, that's 48+1=49 times. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last number ending with 4. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me think: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

From 100-199, 140-149 is another block (10 numbers). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this block. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9=40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

In each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here.

Let's count how many complete blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers, so from 1-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Then, from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is also complete because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the 440-449 block, the tens digit is 4, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, each set of 10 has one 8 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, contributing 48 8's. In the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial block because it only goes up to 488, not 489. So, how many complete blocks are there? From 1-400, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. There's no page number where the hundreds digit is 8, so 8's in the hundreds place are 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the tens and units places.\n\nFor the 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems correct. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's count how many times this happens. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149: another 10. From 201-300, 240-249: another 10. From 301-400, 340-349: another 10. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the end, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10. So, let's add them up: 10 (40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 times. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, the next is 18, ..., the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's count how many times this happens. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189: 10. From 201-300: 280-289: 10. From 301-400: 380-389: 10. From 401-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, it's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which includes 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks of 10, so 50, correct. Units place: 48, as the last 4 in units is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. Correct. For 8's, units place: 49, because 488 is included, so 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times (since 800-899 exceeds 488).\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Since every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of such blocks. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, it's 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but 484 is within this block. So, actually, from 1 to 488, there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 4 (since 488 is the 49th block, starting from 0-9 as the first block). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 1-10: 4, from 11-20:14, ..., from 480-489:484. But since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 480-489. So, how many 4's in the units place? Let's calculate it as follows: The number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, but since we take the floor, it's 48. But wait, when the number is exactly 488, the units digit is 8, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, actually, it's 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1-10:1, 11-20:1, ..., 480-489:1 (but we only go up to 488). So, how many complete decades are there? 48 decades (1-10, 11-20,...,480-489). But since 488 is less than 489, the last decade is incomplete. But in each complete decade, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 decades mean 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 480-489 is the 48th decade, and 484 is within that. So, yes, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let me figure out how many such blocks there are. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is up to 449, and our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. So, how many blocks? Each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99:40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199:140-149, another 10. From 200-299:240-249, another 10. From 300-399:340-349, another 10. From 400-488:440-449, another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total blocks: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? From 1-488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of such numbers is floor((488 + 1)/10) = 48.9, so 48 times? Wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. But 488 is the last number, so in the last decade (480-489), 488 is included. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Wait, because from 1-10:1, 11-20:1,...,480-489:1 (488). So, how many? Let's see: The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. Each hundred has one block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99:80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199:180-189 (10). From 200-299:280-289 (10). From 300-399:380-389 (10). From 400-488:480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this block. So, how many numbers in 480-488 with 8 in the tens place? The tens digit is 8, so numbers like 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 489, the tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the number of 8's is: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, and then 9 more from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 -98=89. So, 89 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 itself end with an 8, so the last number ending with 4 before 488 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many blocks is that? Let's see: 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but does 488 count? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is given by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count the number of such blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are in 480-488? That's 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times, and 8 appears 98 times.

    "text": " Let me think, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, which would give 48 numbers ending with 4. But wait, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so the last number ending with 4 before that is 484. So, that would be the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th number ending with 4. Wait, let me check: from 1-10: 4 is 1. 11-20: 14 is 2. 21-30:24 is 3. ... 481-490:484 is 49. But 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed included. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, right? Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 occurrences. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 starts with a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that addition again: 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. From 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would be 48 numbers ending with 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, that would be the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Since every block of 10 numbers has exactly one number ending with 4, the total number is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I think it's 48 times, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears up to 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let me count how many such blocks are within 1-488. From 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another (10). From 200-299: 280-289 is another (10). From 300-399: 380-389 is another (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 187 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.

There are 48 such occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, truncating to 48).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (from 0-99 to 400-488), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). Since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, there are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me think, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place. Since every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, I can calculate how many tens are there in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, that means 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th ten ends at 480, and then there's 481-488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences of 4. Then, in 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? From 0-488, there are 5 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit in 400-488 would be 0-8, except for 400-409, which is part of the 400s. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So that's another 10. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times. But wait, from 400-488, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, I need to count how many times 8 appears. I'll do the same for 8: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, from 1-488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 1-480, there are 48 numbers with 8 in the units place, and then 488 adds one more, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the counts are: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89 and 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, and 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is 484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence? Wait, no, because 4 is the first occurrence, then 14 is the second, and so on. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me calculate: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Hmm, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, so yes, 49 times in the units place for 4. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the tens place, each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4. So, 5 blocks mean 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but I'm only counting the digit 4, so each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +50 +89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,... up to 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the book. So, does 480-489 count? Since 488 is the last page, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, but in this case, the last block is only 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. Each full block contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. The partial block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens =49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "rollout_idx": 39,
    "answer": "90",
    "is_correct": true,
    "num_tokens": 4886,
    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " Let me think, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4. Well, every 10 numbers, there's one such number. So, how many groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, and then from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that's 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 488 / 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once in each decade, so 48 times from 1-480, and then one more time in 484. So, total 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks exist. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is only the first digit, so each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place (second digit):** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (third digit):** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens place: 50 (from 40-49,140-149, etc.)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 (from 8,18,...,488)\n- Tens place: 49 (from 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488)\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.
