This is every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484. The number of such occurrences is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place.

The count is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   So, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up:\n\\[\n49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188 \\text{ fours}\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which ends at 488, contributing 9 eights:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nAdding them up:\n\\[\n49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98 \\text{ eights}\n\\]\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n\\[\n188 \\text{ fours} - 98 \\text{ eights} = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"
