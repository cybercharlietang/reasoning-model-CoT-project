    "text": " Whereas the 8's in the hundreds place don't appear at all. So, the difference comes mainly from the hundreds place. Let me try another approach: for each digit position, calculate the number of 4's and 8's and compare. Units place: 4's=49, 8's=49. So, same here. Tens place:4's=50,8's=49. So, 4's have one more here. Hundreds place:4's=89,8's=0. So, 4's have 89 more here. So, total difference: (49-49) + (50-49) + (89-0) = 0 +1 +89=90. Yep, that matches. So, the answer should be 90.
