    "text": " When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, 480-488 gives 9 eights in the tens place, which is correct. So, the total eights in the tens place is 49, as I had before. So, that seems correct. So, maybe my initial approach is correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm going to try another approach to verify. Let's consider each digit position separately for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: - Units: 49 - Tens:50 - Hundreds:89 Total:188. For 8's: - Units:49 - Tens:49 - Hundreds:0 Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Alternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position. For the units place, from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last digit if the total isn't a multiple of 10. So, for units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, with 8 remaining numbers. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then digits 1-8 appear once more in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). So, digit 4 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers, 481-488, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's:48 +1=49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 48 times, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so 48 +1=49. So, that's consistent with my earlier count. For the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in each block of 100 numbers. Wait, no, actually, in each block of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488). So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d710=40 times for each digit in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-409: tens digit 0), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). Wait, but 401-409 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 0. Then, 410-419:10 numbers, tens digit 1, and so on up to 480-488:9 numbers, tens digit 8. So, for the tens digit in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does each digit appear? Let's see:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-409: 9 numbers\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419:10\n- Tens digit 2:420-429:10\n- Tens digit 3:430-439:10\n- Tens digit 4:440-449:10\n- Tens digit 5:450-459:10\n- Tens digit 6:460-469:10\n- Tens digit 7:470-479:10\n- Tens digit 8:480-488:9\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the counts are 9,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,9 respectively.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers, it's 10 times. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 hundreds \u00d710=40, plus 10 in the remaining 88, total 50. Which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers, it's 9 times. So, total tens digit 8's: 4 hundreds \u00d710=40, plus 9 in the remaining 88, total 49. Which also matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the hundreds place, in 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as I had before. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, 8 never appears because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so 0 eights there.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. So, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nNumber of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't overcount somewhere. For example, in the units place, I counted 49 fours. Let me list some of them to check: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms is that? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, all counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more '4's are printed than '8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9. So, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. I think I might have made a mistake earlier when I thought it was 90, but I want to make sure. Let me try another approach. Maybe using a formula for counting digits. For a given digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, let me consider each digit position separately again. For the units place: For 4's, it's every 10 numbers, so total occurrences are floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, we add 1, making it 49. Similarly, for 8's, it's also floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, but in the tens place, for 4's, each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4 in the tens place occurs 5 times (for 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, it's 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each with 10, so 5*10=50. For 8's, in the tens place, it's similar: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. For the hundreds place, 4's occur from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, and 8's don't occur because the book doesn't reach 800. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place, 0 eights. So, adding up, 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+49+0=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 90.

    "text": " When counting the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 eights. 4's: 188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of 4's in each position and 8's in each position. Let me try to list them out for a smaller range to see if the method is correct. For example, from 1-100, how many 4's and 8's? 4's: units:10 (4,14,...,94), tens:10 (40-49), hundreds:0 (since 100 is the limit). So, 20 fours. 8's: units:10 (8,18,...,98), tens:10 (80-89), hundreds:0. So, 20 eights. So, in 1-100, 4's and 8's are equal. But in our problem, the book goes up to 488, so beyond 100, we have more 4's in the hundreds place and more in the tens and units places beyond 100. So, perhaps the count is higher for 4's. Let me try another approach: using digit positions. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. 1. Units place: For 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in units place is floor((488)/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1, making it 49. Similarly, for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=8, so add 1, making it 49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. 2. Tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 ten times, and 8 ten times. So, for 4 hundreds, 4*10=40 fours in tens place, and 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours. How about 8? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 eights. So, total tens place: fours=40+10=50, eights=40+9=49. 3. Hundreds place: For hundreds digit, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 8 appears in hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 eights in hundreds place. So, total hundreds place: fours=89, eights=0. Now, adding up all the digits: fours: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89) = 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, that seems consistent. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The last block (480-488) has 9 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " When I count the tens place, the last set is 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, I think that's correct. Maybe I can cross-verify with a smaller number. Let's say, how many 4's and 8's are there in a 100-page book. Let's see: 4's: units place:10 (4,14,...,94), tens place:10 (40-49), hundreds place:0. So, 20 fours. 8's: units place:10 (8,18,...,98), tens place:10 (80-89), hundreds place:0. So, 20 eights. So, 20-20=0. So, in 100 pages, same number of 4's and 8's. So, in 488 pages, the 4's have a higher count because of the hundreds place. So, 90 seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of how many times each digit appears in each position. For units place: from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except maybe the last set if it's not a multiple of 10. So, for units place, 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 times for 4 and 49 times for 8. Wait, but that's only if the last page is a multiple of 10. Since 488 ends with 8, it's included. So, units place:49 fours, 49 eights. Then, tens place: for each set of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each set contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 sets *10=40 fours, 4 sets *10=40 eights. Then, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. In the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. And 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. So, total tens place: fours:40+10=50, eights:40+9=49. So, units place:49 fours, 49 eights. Tens place:50 fours, 49 eights. Hundreds place: fours: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. Eights: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98.

These are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic way. For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let's do that for each position: **Units place:**\n- For 4: The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, N=488. So, floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48. But wait, earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe this formula is different. Wait, let me think. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? They are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, the formula might be floor((N +1)/10) if N is the last number ending with the digit. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate as (N // 10) +1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me think: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, but for d=4, it's a bit different because 4 is the digit we're counting. Let me test this formula with N=488. So, N//10=48, and N%10=8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1. So, 48 +1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8 in the units place: N=488. N//10=48, and N%10=8. Since 8 >=8, we add 1. So, 48 +1=49. So, that's correct. So, using this formula, the number of 4's in units place is 49, and 8's is 49. Now, **tens place:**\n- For 4: The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by considering each block of 100. In each block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, total 40 +10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Alternatively, using the formula: The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is calculated as follows: Let higher = N // 100, current = (N //10) %10, lower = N %10. If current > d: count += (higher +1)*10\nIf current ==d: count += (higher)*10 + lower +1\nIf current <d: count += higher*10\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place, N=488:\n\nhigher = 488 //100=4\ncurrent = (488//10)%10=8%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8 >4, count += (4 +1)*10=5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n\nd=8.\n\nhigher=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8 ==d=8, count += higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 eights in the tens place. Correct.\n\nNow, **hundreds place:**\n\nFor 4:\n\nd=4.\n\nhigher = N //1000=0\ncurrent = (N //100)%10=4\nlower = N%100=88\n\nSince current=4 >=d=4, count += higher*100 + (current >=d ? 100 : 0). Wait, perhaps using the formula:\n\nIf current >d: count += (higher +1)*100\nIf current ==d: count += (higher)*100 + (lower +1)\nIf current <d: count += higher*100\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=4\nlower=88\n\ncurrent=4 ==d=4, so count += higher*100 + lower +1=0 +88 +1=89.\n\nSo, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place:\n\nd=8.\n\nhigher=0\ncurrent=4\nlower=88\n\ncurrent=4 <8, so count += higher*100=0.\n\nSo, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up, 4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89)=188.\n\n8's: units(49) + tens(49) + hundreds(0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake, but now with the formula, it seems correct.

    "text": " When I'm counting the tens place for 8's, in the 480-488 range, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, correct. So, 480-489 would be 10, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, that's correct. So, the tens place for 8's is 49, which includes 5 sets of 10 and 9 in the last set. So, 5*10 +9=59? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, no, I think I confused myself. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the hundreds place for 4's, it's 89, which is a lot. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Then, in the tens place, 50 fours, and units place 49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49=188. Correct. So, I think my calculation is right.

There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. Correct.

So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, there might be overlaps or something I'm missing. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total numbers from 1 to 488: 488 numbers. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th set, 480-488, 4 appears once more in 484. So, 48*1 +1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: Similarly, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the 49th set, 480-488, 8 appears once in 488. So, 48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: For every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, 8 appears 10 times in each 100 numbers in the tens place. From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: As before, no 8's here. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\frac{484}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\frac{488}{10} + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's minus number of 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
