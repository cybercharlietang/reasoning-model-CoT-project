Therefore, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, I might have missed something. Let me try a different approach: instead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can write a small table or use a formula. For example, for the number of times a digit d appears in each position up to a number N, there's a formula or method. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can consider each digit position and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each. Let me try that again. For the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Thus, the difference is 188-98=90.
