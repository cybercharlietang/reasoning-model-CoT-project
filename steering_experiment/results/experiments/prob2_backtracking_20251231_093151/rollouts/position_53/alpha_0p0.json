    "text": " So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again. Wait, when I calculated the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488), totaling 49. So, units and tens each have 49, so 49+49=98 eights. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place, 40-49,140-149, etc., each block of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so does that affect the tens place? No, because in each block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in 400-488, the tens digit still cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440-449 is within 488. So, yes, each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks would give 50 fours in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, the total fours are 188, and eights are 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences for the first four blocks and 9 for the last (480-488).\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems correct. For units place, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. When counting the tens place, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct.

Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the eights in the tens place. When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so that's 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49. That's correct. So, eights in tens place:49. Units place:49, so total eights:98. Fours:188. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me verify the fours again. Units place: from 4,14,...484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place:40-49,140-149,...440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

Wait, that seems correct, but let me check again. Wait, when I counted the units place for 4's, I had 49, which included 484 as the last one. For 8's, units place was also 49, ending at 488. For the tens place, 4's had 50 (from 40-49, etc.), and 8's had 49 because the last set was only 9 numbers. So, 50 vs 49 in tens place. So, the difference there is 1. Then, hundreds place for 4's was 89, and for 8's, it's 0. So, 89 more 4's there. So, total difference: 49 (units) + (50-49)=1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+1+89=139? Wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Hmm, I think I made a mistake somewhere. Let me recalculate the total number of 4's and 8's again. Let's start with 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49+0=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. I think earlier when I was thinking about the difference per digit place, I was miscalculating. The correct total is 188 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
