So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check the counts again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but when I was counting the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that. From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, 10 each for the first four sets and 9 for the last, totaling 49. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units, so 98 total eights. So, the difference is 90.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, did I make a mistake in counting? Let me double-check. For the units place of 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place.

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. Let me recount the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. So, from 1-400, we have 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. So, units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:49+49=98. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Earlier, I thought 49, but now I'm getting 98. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify. When I count units place, it's 49 eights. Tens place: as above, 49 eights. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. Let me recount the eights. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 8, so 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 48*10 = 488. So, the number of terms is 49 (from 0 to 48, inclusive, which is 49 terms). So, units place:49 eights. Tens place: each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Then, tens place:50 fours, units place:49 fours. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct.

From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units:8,18,...,488:49. Tens:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = \\frac{480}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - 80-89: 10 occurrences  \n   - 180-189: 10 occurrences  \n   - 280-289: 10 occurrences  \n   - 380-389: 10 occurrences  \n   - 480-488: 9 occurrences (since the book ends at 488)  \n   Total:  \n   \\[\n   10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, wait. Let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me recount. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights:49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours.\n\nThus, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Hmm, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for fours again. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers is that? The formula is floor((488 -4)/10)+1. (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscounted the eights in the tens place. Let me think again. For the tens digit being 8, the ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: same as fours, 49. So, total eights:98. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check the units place for eights again. The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 488, so 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, that seems correct. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that the hundreds place for fours was 89, and for eights, it's 0. Let me double-check the counts again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Wait, but I thought earlier that the tens place for fours was 50, which is correct because each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), but wait, actually, the hundreds go up to 4, so from 0-400, which is 400 pages. So, 400/100=4, but wait, the book is 488 pages, so up to 488. So, the tens place for fours: from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, units place for eights is 49, tens place is 49, so 98 eights. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,...,484. How many? The last one is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me check the units place for eights again. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98. So, yes, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens digit in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
