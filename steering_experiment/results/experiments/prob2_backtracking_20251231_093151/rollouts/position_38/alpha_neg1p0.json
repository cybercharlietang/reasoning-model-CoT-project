Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. To find the count, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's see, the last page is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, how many such numbers are there? Starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, the first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. To find the count, we can take 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Yes, but our book goes only up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Checking eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89, correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, so 4*10=40, and 480-488 has 9 eights (80-88, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 eights. So, 40+9=49, correct. Units place for eights: from 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see, 8 to 488 with step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49, correct. So, units place eights:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place, fours are in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total fours:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of fours: 188\n   - Number of eights: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

Let me see how many that is. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is every 10 numbers starting at 8. So, 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

Let's see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me list them: starting at 8, each 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49.

Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are there up to 488.

Because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49.

So, fours are 188, eights are 98. 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many eights in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? If I take 488 and subtract 8, that's 480, then divide by 10: 480/10 = 48. Then add 1 because both endpoints are included, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in fours, we had 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights, in the tens place, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so total 49 eights.

The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, no: 8,18,...,488. Let me count how many. The formula is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (488-8)=480, 480/10=48, so 48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, no. Wait, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, which is 4 sets \u00d710=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, it's 8, so each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more eights. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. Starting with fours: units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + 10(n-1). So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488 - 400 +1=89. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now for eights: units place. From 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 +10(n-1)=488. So, 10(n-1)=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Thus, 188 fours - 98 eights=90.

Yes, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488 as part of this. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Okay, I think that's correct.

The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set before that is 10 numbers, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no, 480 is the first, 481 is second, ..., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90.

Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 49 numbers (since 8,18,...488). Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let me see: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389, because 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, so the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. And for eights, no numbers beyond 488, so no hundreds place eights. Units and tens places seem correctly counted.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That's (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9).

Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 5 sets but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. For example, 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Let me just go through once more to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 8 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? Let me think: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's calculate how many terms there are. The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 380-389, because 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but 488 is the last page. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is included. 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, up to 488. So that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, the 8's would be in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. So, that's 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the units and tens for both digits. For 4's: units place, from 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49, correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50, correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89, correct. Total 4's:49+50+89=188, correct. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49, correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set from 480-488 has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct. Hundreds place: none, correct.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, how many sets? Each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would only go up to 488. Let's count: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's to verify. For fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in units? It's every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488//10=48, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49.
