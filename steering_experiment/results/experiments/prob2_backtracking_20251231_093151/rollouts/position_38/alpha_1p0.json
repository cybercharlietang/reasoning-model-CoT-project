    "text": " I think the approach is similar, but I might have made a mistake earlier, so I need to be careful. Again, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place. From 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the last number is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 8 is in the units place there. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place: 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence if we start counting from 0. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Units:49, tens:49, so total eights=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. Units place for both fours and eights: 49 each, because from 4 to 484, that's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly, for eights, 8,18,...,488, which is 49 numbers. So, units place correct. Tens place: fours=50, eights=49. Hundreds place: fours=89, eights=0. So, total fours=188, eights=98. Difference=90.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count the hundreds place correctly for eights? Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Let me check the tens place again for eights. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yep, that's correct. Units place: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place eights:49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights, except maybe the last one. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.

That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-9, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-100, 40-49: 10 fours.

Let me think: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. That seems right. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449) = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - However, in the last block (480-488), only 9 numbers have 8 in the tens place.\n   - Total: 4 full blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set would be 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480-488, so 9 eights in the tens place here.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book since it's up to 488. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, for the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8s: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This is 89 occurrences (400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

I'll go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because the book has 488 pages. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. The total number is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So, let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place eights would be: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but is that correct? Let me check again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 1-100:80-89:10, 101-200:180-189:10, 201-300:280-289:10, 301-400:380-389:10, and 401-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, so total fours are 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights there, making the tens place total 49. Units place: 49, so 49+49=98. So, yeah, 188-98=90.

Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with 4 in hundreds place. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: starting at 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 would be the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me make sure. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. \n   - This is every 10th number, starting at 4 and ending at 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting at 8 and ending at 488, each step is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, so that's okay. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me think: from 80-89, that's 10. Similarly, each subsequent block adds another 10, but the last one only has 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 4 blocks with 10 and 1 block with 9: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the number of eights in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.

So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights.

Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the tens place for eights. When I was counting the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. But wait, 480 is 480, which has an 8 in the tens place, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place from that block.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 49 eights in tens place. So, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. Let me confirm: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number because (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the fours were 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's 49 numbers (including both 4 and 484). Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake earlier, but I think I need to be careful here. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit is 8. How many such numbers? Well, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see how many terms that is. The first term is 8, which is 8 = 8 + 10*(0), and the last term is 488 = 8 + 10*(n-1). Let me solve for n: 488 = 8 + 10(n-1) => 480 = 10(n-1) => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yes, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, we subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Let me count how many full decades there are: from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's four sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. Similarly, units place: 49, as each 10 numbers contribute one 8, and 488 is included, so 49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours: 188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yep, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, does it include 480-489? Yes, 480-488 are included. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-400: 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, for the tens place, in 1-400, we have 4 blocks of 10, which is 40 eights. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, up to 400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems off because I thought earlier that the units place had 49 eights, and the tens had 49, so total 98. But wait, let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 in units place. Tens place: as above, 49. So total eights: 49+49=98. Wait, but earlier when I thought about the tens place, I had 40 from 1-400 and 9 from 400-488, which adds up to 49. So, yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the fours in the hundreds place. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the units place, I got 49 fours. Let me confirm that. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for the eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, total eights:98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. So, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but in reality, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's correct. So, 40 from 1-400 and 9 from 400-488, totaling 49 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90.

Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me check: from 0 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's 488//10 + 1 if 488 is included. Wait, 488//10 is 48, and since 488 is included, it's 49.

But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10.

I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but 488 is included, so it's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 is another set, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yes. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe I should use a similar approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,... up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 80-89 is within 1-488, 180-189 is okay, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 numbers (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, that's 9 more eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that's 90 more fours. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me go through the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for eights again.

So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. Counting fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149, etc. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 4 full blocks (400s not yet counted), but wait, 400-488 is the hundreds place, but for the tens place, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, yes, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake earlier, so I should be careful here. Let's go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last occurrence in the units place would be 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, which is 8 = 8 + 10*0, and the last term is 488 = 8 + 10*48. So, the number of terms is 49, same as the 4's in units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489. But since the book goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But 480-489 is only up to 488, so that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how many eights in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9 =49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, did I count correctly? Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, in fours, I had 50, which comes from 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets of 10, so 50. That's correct. Units place: 49 fours, same as eights. For eights, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
