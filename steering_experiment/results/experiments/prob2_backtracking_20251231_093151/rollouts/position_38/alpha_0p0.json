    "text": " Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Because starting from 8, every 10th number up to 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-489 would be the next set, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: 49 (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 49 (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Additionally, 480-488 contributes 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8,18,...,488. That's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so total is 98. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

The last number with 8 in units place is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which gives 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers, so that's 4 blocks. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So that's 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 count? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but only up to 488. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, let me think again. Wait, no, because 480-489 is the next block after 380-389. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488. So, the tens digit being 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, we have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8? But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let's recount the eights in the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, so total 98. Fours: 188, so 188-98=90.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th 8 in the units place? Let me think: 8, 18, 28,...,488. The first is 8, which is the 1st, then 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought units place had 49, tens had 49, so total 98 eights. But let me check again. Units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total 98.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

Let's see, the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers because 8 is the first, and 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the first four blocks, that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Yep, that seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each part again.\n\nFor the fours:\n\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the eights:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488. That's from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four sets have 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens:40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: None, as the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours - 98 eights =90. So, the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using digit positions and calculating the number of times each digit appears in each position. I think that's what I did, so it should be correct. Alternatively, maybe I can write a small table to count the occurrences.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nBut I think my previous approach is solid.

Hmm, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1), so n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? 488 is 8 +10*(n-1)=488, so n-1=(488-8)/10=480/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. That seems correct. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: Units place: from 4,14,...484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for eights: Units place: from 8,18,...488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no, wait. 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8 in 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many sets of 100 have tens digit 8. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480 is the first, 488 is the ninth). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a difference of 90. But let me think again about the tens place for 4's. Wait, when I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. Since 484 is the last page, 484 is included. So, how many terms? Let's see: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10) +1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 488 is included, and the units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so the number of 4's in units place is 48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: from 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so it's (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. For the tens place of 8's, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 times, right? Because from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Wait, but wait, the next range would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 9 numbers here. So, I need to adjust for that. So, the tens place 8's are in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought only up to 380-389, but 480-488 also has 8's in the tens place. So, that's 5 sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. Hmm, that's interesting. So, units place had 49, tens place has 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block. Let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) - 180-189: 10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488:9 (since 489 isn't included) So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me confirm: units 49, tens 49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's see, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Starting from 8, each step of 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's see how many numbers that is. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again: units place 49, tens place 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10) and one partial set with 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Yes, it's the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 +1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., gives 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights =90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4 full sets and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. That seems right. Similarly, units place: 49 eights. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would suggest 49 numbers, just like the 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, so each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last block, which might be cut off. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought it was 50 fours in the tens place. Let me recount that. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Yes, that's correct. For the eights in the tens place, I had 49. Let me check that again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, no, each block is 100 numbers, so from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49.

Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me think. Starting from 8, every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8 (which is 8*1), the last term is 488 (which is 8*61). Wait, 8*61=488, so that's 61 terms. Wait, that can't be right because 8*61=488, but 8*1=8, so the number of terms is 61. But wait, 488 is the 61st term. So, units place has 61 eights. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488 is 48 full decades (1-480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). Each full decade has exactly one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more, at 488. So total units place eights: 48 +1=49. Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So, which is correct? Let me do it step by step. The units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So total units eights: 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block of 100 numbers (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, from 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) contributing 10 each, and the last partial decade contributing 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. Now, the fours were 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: units, tens, hundreds. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.

So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we have to include 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is included, so units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the last set 480-488 which is 9. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just double-check the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. When I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189)+10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+9 (480-488)=49. That's correct. Similarly, for fours, the hundreds place goes up to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there. Units place for fours: up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. So, 49+50+89=188. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many sets are there? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me count how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10.
