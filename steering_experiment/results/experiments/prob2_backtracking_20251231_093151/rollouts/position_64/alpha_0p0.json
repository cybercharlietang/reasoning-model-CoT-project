Let me see if I missed anything. Wait, in the tens place for 4's, I counted 50, but the book only goes up to 488.

So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, maybe I can think of a different way to count. Alternatively, I can consider each digit position separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each. Let me try that approach to cross-verify.\n\nFor the units place:\n- 4's: every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more for the last partial ten (484). So, 49.\n- 8's: same logic, 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, units place for 8's was 49, but in the tens place, I had 49, so total 98. Hmm, but in the units place, 8's are 49, which is correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n- 4's: each hundred has a block where tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers per hundred. So, from 1-488, there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) up to 400-488. So, in each hundred, there's a 10-number block where tens digit is 4. So, 0-99: 40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n- 0-99:80-89 (10)\n- 100-199:180-189 (10)\n- 200-299:280-289 (10)\n- 300-399:380-389 (10)\n- 400-488:480-488 (9)\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n- 8's: 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are none. So 0.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

So, that's correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the difference is indeed 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount the last set. Let me check the units place for 8's again. The last 8 in the units place is 488, right? So, starting at 8, every 10 numbers: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's set that equal to 488: 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 terms, correct.

Page numbers:1-10. 4's: page 4. So, 1 four. 8's: page 8. So, 1 eight. Difference: 0. According to my method: Units place: 4 appears once (page 4). Tens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 10, no 4's in tens place. Hundreds place: none. So, total fours:1. Units place for 8:8 appears once. Tens place:80-89, but we only go up to 10, so no eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:1. Difference:0. Correct. Another example: 20-page book. Let's see. 4's: pages 4,14,24. Wait, no, up to 20. So, 4,14. So, two fours. 8's:8,18. So, two eights. Difference:0. According to my method: Units place:4,14:2 fours. Tens place:40-49, but up to 20, so no fours in tens place. So, total fours:2. Units place for 8:8,18:2 eights. Tens place:80-89, but up to 20, so none. So, eights:2. Difference:0. Correct. Wait, but in my method, for the 20-page book, the units place for 4's would be 20/10=2, correct. For 8's, same. Now, let's try a 50-page book. 4's: units place:4,14,24,34,44:5 fours. Tens place:40-49:10 fours. So, total fours:15. 8's: units place:8,18,28,38,48:5 eights. Tens place:40-49: no, 80-89: but up to 50, so 80-89 isn't there. So, tens place:0. So, total eights:5. Difference:15-5=10. Let me count manually: Page numbers 1-50. 4's:4,14,24,34,44,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49. Wait, that's more than 15. Wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, plus 4,14,24,34,44 in the units place. So, 10+5=15 fours. 8's:8,18,28,38,48, and 80-89 isn't in 50. So, 5 eights. So, difference is 10. So, my method works here. So, applying it to 488, I think the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
