Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. But does 488 count as 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 4 (hundreds), 8 (tens), 8 (units). So yes, it's included. So 89 is correct. For the tens place in 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, not 10, because 480 is the first, and 488 is the ninth. Wait, no: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9. So 49 in tens place for 8's. So 49+49=98. So 188-98=90.

For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. For the tens place in 4's, up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. For the units place in 4's, up to 484, which is correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 90 seems to be the right answer. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method. Alternatively, I can consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each. Let's try that approach for verification. For the units digit: For each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete sets, and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's:48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: each complete set of 10 has one 8, so 48 times, and in the extra numbers, 488 has an 8, so 48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place: For each complete set of 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 pages mean 4 complete sets of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and 88 extra pages (401-488). In each 100 set, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 4 complete 100s, that's 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is the limit). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but we only go to 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, in the extra 88 pages, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: in each 100, 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49. Correct. For the hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as before. 8 appears in 800-899, which is beyond our book, so 0. So, total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188. 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. I think that's correct.

So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way. Let me consider each digit position again, but perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. For the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N is calculated as follows: For units digit: floor((N)/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >=d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for units digit d, the count is floor(N/10) + 1 if the last digit is >=d. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. For units digit 4, the count is how many times 4 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if the units digit of 488 is >=4. 488 //10 is 48, and the units digit is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49. That's correct. Similarly, for tens digit 4, it's a bit more involved. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. Correct. For the hundreds digit, it's 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. For the eights: Units digit: same as before, 49. Tens digit:80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units and tens:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems consistent. I think my initial calculation was correct.

The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484. The number of terms is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 fours in the units place.\n\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n     So, there are 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. The count is:\n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n     So, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n   - **Total Fours:** Adding them up:\n     \\[\n     49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n     \\]\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488. The number of terms is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 eights in the units place.\n\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers (since the book ends at 488):\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n     So, there are 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** There are no page numbers in the range 800-899, so there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\n   - **Total Eights:** Adding them up:\n     \\[\n     49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of eights from the total number of fours:\n     \\[\n     188 - 98 = 90\n     \\]\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

Because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct because 488-400+1=89. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. So that seems right. Another way to think about it: from 1 to 488, how many hundreds digits are 4? It's 89. So that's correct. For 8's, in the hundreds place, since we only go up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0 there. So, yes, 98 eights in total. So 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 5 sets of 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. - Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188. That's correct. Now, for the 8's: - Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. The formula is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't think I made a mistake here. So, the answer should be 90 more fours.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10, except 480-488 which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
