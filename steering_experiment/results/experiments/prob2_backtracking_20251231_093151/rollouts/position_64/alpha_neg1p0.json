I think that's correct. Maybe I can check with smaller numbers to see if my method works. For example, in a 10-page book, how many more 4's than 8's? Pages 1-10. 4 appears once (page 4). 8 appears once (page 8). So, 1-1=0. Let me apply my method: Units place: 4 and 8 each appear once. Tens place: none for 4 or 8. So, 1 each. 1-1=0. Correct. Another example: 20-page book. 4's: pages 4,14,24? Wait, no, 20 is the last page, so 24 is beyond. So, 4 and 14. So, 2 fours. 8's:8 and 18. So, 2 eights. Difference is 0. Using my method: Units place: 4 and 8 each appear twice? Wait, no. From 1-20, units place 4:4,14. Units place 8:8,18. So, 2 each. Tens place: 40-49 isn't in 20, so 0. So, 2 fours, 2 eights.
