    "text": " Let's count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another set, another 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Let me check: from 0-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. Then 180-189, another 10. 280-289, another 10. 380-389, another 10. Then 480-488: how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does it end with 88? Let me see: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, ..., 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count how many full blocks and partial blocks. Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are four such blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4*10=40. Now, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so we have four sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many full hundreds do we have? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 is one set of 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149 is another set. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's five sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I'm only supposed to count the 4's, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which would be 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in units is 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So units: 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets \u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many hundreds? 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four hundreds (0-399) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last hundred (400-488) has 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98. But let me double-check the tens place. For 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 400-488 range. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9=49. Units place: 49. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 occurrences.  \n   Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   The first four ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 occurrences.  \n   In the range 400-488, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.  \n   Total occurrences: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers in 800-899 exist, so no 8's here.  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? The hundreds digits can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But 0 in the hundreds place would mean single-digit numbers, which don't have a tens place. So, starting from 40-49 (hundreds digit 0), then 140-149 (hundreds digit 1), 240-249 (hundreds digit 2), 340-349 (hundreds digit 3), and 440-449 (hundreds digit 4). Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, totaling 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add another 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89 (hundreds digit 0), 180-189 (hundreds digit 1), 280-289 (hundreds digit 2), 380-389 (hundreds digit 3), and 480-488 (hundreds digit 4). Now, for the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. That's 4 sets, 10 each, so 40 eights. Now, the last range is 480-488. How many numbers are there here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of these 9 numbers has an 8. So, that's 9 eights. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, 10 each: 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for eights? For the tens place, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours, the hundreds place goes up to 440-449, but wait, 488 is beyond 449, so in the hundreds place, from 400-488, all have 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me count how many full groups of 100 there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for the tens place, the 4's occur in each hundred block. In each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's five blocks. But wait, the last block is only up to 488, so does that affect the tens place? Let me see: in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, 400-488 includes the tens digits from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is determined by the second digit, so 400-409: tens digit is 0, 410-419: tens digit is 1, ..., 440-449: tens digit is 4, 450-459: tens digit is 5, etc., up to 480-489: tens digit is 8. But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, but that's not relevant for the tens digit being 4. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers. So, in each hundred block, except maybe the last one, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. But let's check:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, adding up all the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the incomplete group (481-488), there's a 4 in 484. So, total units place fours would be 48 + 1 = 49, which matches my earlier count.\n\nNow, for the tens place: each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place: numbers 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the incomplete group, 488 is included. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. Let's count:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is included, but 489 is beyond 488)\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. For each hundred block except the last one, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers. So:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 98 eights? Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place eights were 49, which is correct, and the tens place eights were 49 as well. So, total eights: 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights. Let me recount the tens place eights. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place eights: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? Let's see: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th. So, 49. Correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nFours: 188.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one '4', and an additional '4' in 484. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one '8', and an additional '8' in 488. Total: 49.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n\nTotal number of '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. Each set of 100 (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. Each such block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me check: 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, each block contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. How many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 and 1 block with 9. So, total eights in tens place: (4\u00d710) + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 484 is the 49th number).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-99: 10 times.

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).

Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have tens digit 8? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 has tens digit 8, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block: - 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 is 10. - 200-299: 280-289 is 10. - 300-399: 380-389 is 10. - 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a 40s block where 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 fours. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10 fours. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10 fours. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10 fours.

Wait, but from 401-488, the tens place 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.

That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in the hundreds place, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down: - From 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 eights. - From 101-200: 180-189, another 10 eights. - From 201-300: 280-289, another 10 eights. - From 301-400: 380-389, another 10 eights. - From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe task is to determine how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me think. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-99, the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. From 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. From 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Hmm, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but in each hundred, it's 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10, except the last one which contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 hundreds with 10 each, and the last hundred with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Let me think: each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, there are 10 such numbers (40-49).

Then, 401-500: 440-449, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is still within 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Okay, so that's 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think: from 400 to 499, there are 100 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Similar to the fours, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this set. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus the 480-488, which is 9. So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial block 480-488.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets, 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.

So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit is 8. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers (since 8 is the first, and 488 is the 49th). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many terms, we can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. Then in 400-488, it's 440-449, which is another 10 numbers.

To find how many, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For the eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, I considered each hundred block, and in the last block (400-488), the tens digit 4 runs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 fours total. For eights, units place: 49, tens place: 49. Let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for fours. When counting units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. Let me see how many terms are there. The first term is 4, the last is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for eights in the units place, it's 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, correct. For the tens place, fours: each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, except the last one, which is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total 5 hundreds, 10 each, so 50. Correct. For eights in tens place, it's similar but the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, I think my calculations are correct, so the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** In each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), 4 appears in the tens place 10 times. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), giving 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** In each hundred block, 8 appears in the tens place 10 times. The last block (400-488) contributes 9 occurrences (480-488). Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four sets each have 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So total eights in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds (0-399) contribute 4 x 10 = 40, and the last partial hundred (400-488) contributes 9. So, total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me see: Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49 is the first block, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another 10, and so on. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, we have 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480s, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let me count each block. Each block is 10 numbers, so each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49, that's one block. Then 140-149, another block, and so on. Let's see: 40-49: 10 fours in the tens place. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have a 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last number is 488, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens, so 49 numbers (including 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. The hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

The last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th number because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let's count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for each hundred, that's 10 fours in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, correct. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 fours, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. For the eights, in the tens place, in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights, plus the 40 from the first four hundreds, totaling 49. Units place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

There are 4 complete blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, that's actually 5 blocks, but the last one isn't complete. Let me think again. From 1-400, there are 4 complete blocks of 100. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that adds 10 more. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188 fours. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 complete blocks, each contributing 10 eights: 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place, I thought it was 49. Let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, same as fours: 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are.

So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so yes, 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my counting again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place fours: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) which is 4*10=40, plus 480-488 which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98, difference:90. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so when counting the hundreds place, 400-488, that's correct. But let me think again: for the units place, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, but we're counting fours, so 488's units digit is 8, not 4. So, that doesn't affect the fours count. Similarly, for the tens place, 488's tens digit is 8, so that's an eight, which we've counted in the eights. So, yes, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. And 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's would be 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The last occurrence is at 488, so dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Yes, 488 is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, so each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last one. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, how many 8's? Each hundred block contributes 10, except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 hundreds (0-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the last 9, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens: 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total 98 eights. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, since 800>488. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each hundred block has 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each hundred block has 10, except the last which has 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since 800 > 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. And 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, but page numbers go up to 488, so 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, so 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, for the tens place being 4, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But 0 in the hundreds place would mean it's a two-digit number, so 40-49 is one set. Then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.

So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, but the last set is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count the complete sets first: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place from this set. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Let's see: Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.

So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8, 18, ..., 488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488.

Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

    "text": " Let me check how many sets of 100 there are. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets with 10 each and 1 set with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488.

The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Then 140-149: another 10 fours. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. And 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I'm only considering the hundreds place, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let me add them up: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total fours: 49+50+89= 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that's actually 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that again. Each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding them up: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:49+49=98. Wait, that seems off because I thought the hundreds place would have none, but let me make sure. Since the highest page number is 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4, but never 8. So, yes, hundreds place:0. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the fours:\n\n- Units place:49. Let me list some:4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:5 sets of 10, each set contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place:49. From 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place:0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's,\" so the answer is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Did I count correctly in the tens place for eights? Because in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights. And fours are 188. So, 188-98=90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: how many is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: total fours (188) minus total eights (98) = 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are where the tens digit is 4. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so it's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. So, let's count how many complete sets there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me see: from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400 to 488 includes 489 numbers? No, wait, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of this. Let's count: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total is 10*4 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly in the tens place for fours. Let me check again. For fours in the tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Yes, that's correct. And for eights in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49. So, yes, 49. So, the difference is indeed 90.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds do we have? From 1-400, that's four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers. Then from 401-488, another 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences (since 484 is the 49th number in this sequence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - From 1-400, there are four such blocks, and from 401-488, another block.\n   - Total: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences (since 488 is the 49th number in this sequence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - From 1-400, there are four such blocks, and from 401-488, a partial block (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289:10 numbers. 380-389:10 numbers. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, is that right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So that's five sets. Each of the first four sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. The last set, 400-488, has 40-49, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 400-488 is from 400 to 488, so the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, but wait, no, 400-409 would have 4 in the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 0. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0. In 410-419, it's 1, and so on. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. So that's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, in each hundred except the last one, we have 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. The last hundred (400-488) also has 10 numbers (440-449) where the tens digit is 4. So, total tens place 4's: 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, so total 50. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, so that's another 10, making it 5 hundreds? Wait, no, the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So that's five sets. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and the fifth set (400-488) has 10 numbers (440-449). So total tens place 4's: 5*10=50. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Wait, when I counted units place, I said 49, but let me double-check that. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So that's correct. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400s. So, how many such sets? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488. Now, 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 488-480+1=9. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 from 400-488. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For each hundred except the last one (400-488), we have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10). That's 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. So, that's correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. Units place for 4's:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly. Another way to count the number of 4's: Let's consider each digit position separately. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? As before, 49 times. Tens place: in each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers.\n   - Occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n   - In 400-488, 8 appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 and 9, so total 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, we have 488 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens place has 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 401-488. Wait, but the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's five sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, in the last set, 440-449, does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 2? Wait, no, better to think of it as how many numbers between 1 and 488 end with 8. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 +10(n-1) \u2264488. Let's solve for n: 10(n-1) \u2264480 \u2192 n-1 \u226448 \u2192 n \u226449. So, 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, we have 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500, but only up to 488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. Let's check each hundred: - 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - 101-200: 180-189 \u219210 numbers. - 201-300:280-289 \u219210 numbers. - 301-400:380-389 \u219210 numbers. - 401-488:480-488. Here, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the last hundred, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that range. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, total eights are 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.

This range includes 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, in the tens place, 4 can appear in each hundred block. For each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? In each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. Now, 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that, so it's fine. So, total of 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: In each hundred block, 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 5 hundred blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
