    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. Let's see how many such sets exist. The first set is 40-49, which is within 1-488. The next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is still within 488, right? Because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five sets, each with 10 numbers. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is the fifth set, and 449 is the last number in that set. So, yes, 5 sets. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets are there? 80-89 is the first, 180-189 the second, 280-289 the third, 380-389 the fourth, and 480-488 the fifth. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, but the fifth set (480-488) has only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, for the first four sets, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights, and the fifth set has 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the fours total was 188, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me check again. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, but let me confirm the fours again. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers is that? The last number is 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. So, units:49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm wondering if I missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. And for eights, there are none in the hundreds place. So, yes, 0. So, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers from 800-899 are included.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count the number of such sets: 40-49 is one set, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 fours, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check the last set. 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Let me confirm: 400 has a 4, 401 has a 4, ..., up to 488. Yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, so 488 is included as the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets? 80-89 is one set, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The fifth set (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. So, from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I might be making a mistake here. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the last number is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9). So, total sets: 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) each contributing 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from the last set. So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " 440-449 is within 488. How many sets of ten are there? Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. For eights, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. Wait, but when I was counting the units place for fours, I thought 484 is the last one, which is correct, giving 49 fours. Similarly, for eights, 488 is included, so 49 eights in units place. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set has 10 numbers. Let's see: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another set, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait a second. The book goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449, which is within 488. So, yes, 5 sets. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400 is included, so 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of terms is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >= 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, last is 488. So, how many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, we check if 488 mod 10 is 8, which it is. So, the number of terms is 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many such sets are there? From 40-49 (that's one set), then 140-149 (second), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does the last set go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place will have 4 in all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, up to 488. So, how many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, solving for n: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see how many full sets there are. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289 (another 10), 380-389 (another 10), and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets contribute 4 * 10 = 40 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place will have 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but again, we need to check if 488 is included. 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set contributes 10 eights except maybe the last one. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " So, how many sets of 100 are there? There's 400-488, but in the tens place, 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. But we're only interested in the tens place being 4, which occurs in 400-409, 440-449. Wait, no. Actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds do we have? From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, but 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. So, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10 numbers, so that's 20 fours in the tens place for the 400-488 range. Wait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 fours, but in this case, the 400-488 part contributes 20 fours. So, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of each position separately. Let's try again. For the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's the same as the number of times the tens digit is 4 in all page numbers up to 488. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, it's 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349: each 10. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449: 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds do we have? Up to 488, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, we have 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, we have another 10 fours in 440-449. So total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 401-488 range, which is the fifth hundred. So, total tens place fours: 5 sets of 10? Wait, no, because from 1-400, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred, and in that, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total is 40 +10=50 fours in the tens place. So, units place:49, tens place:50. Now, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units:49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 fours, so 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So, 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many hundreds? From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place: 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488:9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 40 (from 1-400) +9=49 eights. Wait, let me check: from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights:0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is included. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place has 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place has 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and since 488 is higher than 449, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9 eights (since 488 is the last page). Let me count the number of sets: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total eights in the tens place are 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, yes. So, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** '4' appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each range contributes 10 '4's, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 '4's.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** '4' appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** '8' appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit):** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. Each range contributes 10 '8's except the last, which contributes 9 (since the book ends at 488). This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 '8's.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit):** No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many sets of 100 are there? Well, from 0-488, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409 and 410-419, but wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, then 1 in 410-419, and so on. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0. In 410-419, it's 1, and so on. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the addition: 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think. Each digit place is being counted separately, so maybe it's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me confirm: 8, 18, ..., 488. The first is 8, which is the 1st occurrence, and the last is 488, which is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 100 have a tens digit of 8. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are there from 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 eights. Wait, that's 49. But let me think again. Wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me check if I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct. For the tens place, in the hundreds, I had 4 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contributing 10 fours, so 40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because the hundreds place for eights is zero, which seems right since the book ends at 488. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For both 4 and 8, it's the same as every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, but for 4, the last number is 484, which is 48*10 + 4, so 48 times 10 gives 480, plus 4 is 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours. Similarly, for 8, the last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so 48 +1 =49 eights. So that's correct. For the tens place: For 4, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. For 8 in the tens place: Similarly, in each hundred, 10 numbers have 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. For the hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 eights in hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. This is 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

This is 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours.

Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. Let's count each set. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page). So, how many eights in the tens place? The first four sets contribute 10 each, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last set from 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Then, 450-488 would not have a 4 in the tens place. So, each of these ranges (40-49, 140-149, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). In 100-199: 140-149 (10). In 200-299: 240-249 (10). In 300-399: 340-349 (10). In 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, wait, let me double-check. From 40-49: 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through the units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers, and 480-488 has 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. How many sets of 100 are there? From 1 to 488, we have four sets: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but the tens place 4 occurs in each of these sets. So, in each set, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, in 0-99, that's 10 numbers (40-49). In 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 10 numbers. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99, 40-49: 10. 100-199: 140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: from 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. Wait, 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each set: - 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. - 100-199:180-189:10 numbers. - 200-299:280-289:10 numbers. - 300-399:380-389:10 numbers. - 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets with 10 each, and one set with 9. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total eights=49+49=98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. In 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me see: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 fours. That seems right. Similarly, for eights, no hundreds digit is 8, so 0. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets, totaling 50 fours.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The set 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences. Total tens place 8's = 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 440-449 is 10 numbers, and each contributes a 4 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is one set, then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through each place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many sets there are. Starting from 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (another 10), 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Then, each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such sets are there? From 40-49, that's one set. Then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) would have a set where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 4 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's five sets? Wait, no, because 400-488 is the last hundred block. Let me count again: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so we have 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each of these sets (except the last one) has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, let's break it down: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I did the units place for 4's, I got 49, and for 8's also 49. But let me double-check the tens place for 4's: I had 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. For 8's in tens place, I had 49 eights. So, 50 (tens fours) + 49 (units fours) + 89 (hundreds fours) = 188 fours. For 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " 440-449 is 10 numbers, and each contributes a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, and 340-349 is another 10. So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. So, total number of 4's is 178. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 48*10=480, so 488 is the 8th in the 49th set. Wait, no, each set of 10 has exactly one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is 49. Wait, but let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these sets contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, total number of 8's is 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 - 89 = 89. Wait, that seems too clean. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=89. Total=49+40=89, plus 89 is 178. For 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. Total=89. So, 178-89=89. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. Each set contributes 10, totaling 40.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each set contributes 10, totaling 40.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond. So, how many sets of ten are there where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. So, the tens place has 50 fours. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, all of them are included. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which it is for all these numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so the digit 4 appears once in each of these numbers in the hundreds place. So, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Wait, but 488 - 400 + 1 is 89, so yes, 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, yes, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89 is one set, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, first four sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets \u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, how many more fours than eights? 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me just check again for any possible mistakes. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's list them: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add another 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets with 10 eights each and 1 set with 9 eights. So, 4 x 10 = 40 and 1 x 9 = 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " 440-449 is 10 numbers, so each of these decades contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such decades there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 minus 400 plus 1 (since both ends are inclusive) equals 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Let's count how many sets there are. Each set (like 40-49) has 10 numbers, so each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149: another set, and so on. Let me calculate the number of complete sets. The first set is 40-49, which is within 1-488. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets in total. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188? Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me recount. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, the 48th set ends at 480, so the next number is 481, which doesn't have a 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is within the range, so that would be the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: as before, 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count the number of complete sets. Each set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 80-89: one set, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another, and 480-488: that's a partial set because it only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full sets? The first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) are complete, each contributing 10 eights. The fifth set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit being 8, the sets are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no 8 in the hundreds place, so 0. So, total eights: 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours, and units place 49 fours. So, 89 +50 +49=188 fours.\n\nFor the eights, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Let me recount the eights in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: in each hundred, there are 10 eights (8,18,28,...,98). So, 4 complete hundreds would have 4\u00d710=40 eights. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many eights in the units place? From 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49 eights in the units place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full sets (40) and a partial set (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " How many sets are there? From 40-49 is one set, then each hundred has another set. So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears exactly 89 times, once for each number from 400 to 488. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. For units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 times, plus one more in 484, making it 49. So, units: 49. Tens: as above, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then one more at 488, making it 49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. So, how many sets of 100 are there? Let's see: from 1-100, 40-49 is one set (10 numbers). Then 140-149 is another set, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets in total. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but I need to check if 440-449 is fully included in 1-488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this set. Let me count how many full sets and partial sets there are. Each full set (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many full sets? 80-89 is one set, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total sets: 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial set contributing 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens place for 440-449 is 4, but what about 450-488? The tens digit is 5,6,7,8, which are not 4. So, yes, only 440-449 contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets, each with 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, so 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place, in the hundreds, we had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.

Wait, but wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, but the book goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is okay. So, 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488, so it's from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, we can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see: Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four sets gives 10 eights, so 4*10=40, and the last set gives 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last set being 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 40 occurrences, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens place has a 4 in 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, for each hundred, that's 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have? Let's see: 1-99: 10 fours (40-49). 100-199: another 10 fours (140-149). 200-299: another 10 fours (240-249). 300-399: another 10 fours (340-349). 400-488: here, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours. So, total fours in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 400-488: does 440-449 fall entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 10 fours here. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Adding up, yes, 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. 400-488: 480-488: Here, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in 400-488, the tens place is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, and then adding 89 (hundreds) would be 99 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think. Wait, from 1-99, how many fours are there? In units place: 9 fours (4,14,24,...,84). In tens place: 10 fours (40-49). So, 19 fours from 1-99. Then from 100-399: Each hundred has 10 fours in the units place and 10 in the tens place, so 20 per hundred. There are three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3*20=60. Then from 400-488: 89 fours in the hundreds place, 10 fours in the tens place (440-449), and how many in the units? From 400-488, the units place 4's are 404,414,...,484. How many? Let's see: 404 is the first, then every 10 after that up to 484. So, (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1= 8 +1=9. Wait, but from 400-488, the units place 4's are 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, units place in 400-488: 9 fours. Tens place: 440-449: 10 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, from 400-488: 9 +10 +89=108 fours. Now, adding up: 1-99:19, 100-399:60, 400-488:108. Total fours:19+60=79+108=187. Wait, earlier I thought it was 188, but now it's 187. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount. From 1-99: units place has 9 fours (4,14,...,84). Tens place has 10 fours (40-49). So, 19. From 100-399: Each hundred has 10 in units, 10 in tens, so 20 per hundred. Three hundreds: 3*20=60. From 400-488: units place: 9 fours, tens place:10 fours, hundreds place:89 fours. So, 9+10+89=108. So total fours:19+60+108=187. Okay, so 187 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last page is 488, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The difference is 488-8=480. Divided by 10 gives 48 intervals, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each full set (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full sets are there? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four sets contribute 4*10=40 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1s):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nSo, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. The last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89.

So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place never has an 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid.

That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, that's not right.

So, 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing a 4, and then the 49th in 484. So, 49 fours. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 4? Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has one set of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers), 101-200: 140-149 (10), 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10), and 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.

So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 488 = 8 + 10*(n-1). Let's solve for n: 488 - 8 = 480 = 10*(n-1), so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. So, let's count how many sets:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10, and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the counting.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I was counting the units place for fours, I went up to 484, which is 484, right? So, 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor the eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. How many? Let's see, 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens digit in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds digit for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens digit in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. But the 4 in the tens place occurs in each hundred block. So, in each hundred, the tens place has 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, for 4 hundreds, that would be 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, does the 400-488 range include another set? Wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens place 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens place 4 occurs in 400-409, but that's only 10 numbers. Wait, no, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, except maybe the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many terms are there. The first term is 8, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) \u2264 488. So, 10*(n-1) \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9 (from 480 to 488). Totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers, so 10 numbers per set. Let's count the sets: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check each place separately: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count the sets: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 eights each, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, how many sets of ten are there where the tens digit is 4? From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. Let's see how many such sets exist. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 fours. Then 101-200: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. 401-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So total fours would be 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9. So, 10 +10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me recount the fours and eights to make sure I didn't make a mistake. **Counting Fours Again:**\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484 with step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours.\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49, 140-149,...,440-449. How many hundreds? From 0-99, 100-199,...,400-488. So, 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each of the first four sets has 10 fours in the tens place, and the last set (400-488) has 440-449, which is 10 fours. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place.\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\n**Counting Eights Again:**\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is included. So, from 8 to 488 with step 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights.\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 eights, and the last set has 9 eights (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights.\n- Hundreds place: None, as before.\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct too. So, yeah, I think 90 is the correct answer. But let me just check if I counted correctly for the tens place in fours. For the tens place, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. From 0-99:40-49 (10), 100-199:140-149 (10), 200-299:240-249 (10), 300-399:340-349 (10), and 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. So, yeah, I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. 180-189 is another 10. 280-289 is another 10. 380-389 is another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, then 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake in counting. Let me go back. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units (49), tens (49). 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours:188. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly for the units place of fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. So, 484/10=48.4, so 49 terms. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For eights, units place:8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1:49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. Total 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think differently. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For any digit d (except maybe 0), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as floor((n + 1)/10). But wait, let me think. From 1 to n, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades plus 1 if the digit is less than or equal to the units digit of n. Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula: For units digit, count = (n // 10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d, else n//10. But perhaps I can use a more systematic approach. Let me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position. Units place: For 4's, the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete sets of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, plus 1 if the units digit of 488 is >=4. 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Same as before. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 488 //10=48, and since units digit is 8 >=8, add 1:48+1=49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Now, tens place: For 4's, we look at how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each time, it's a block of 100 numbers where the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred block, there's a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. So, number of blocks is 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 (440-449) and 8 (480-488). So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total number of 4's in tens place is 5 blocks (each contributing 10 numbers) except the last block where it's only 10 numbers as well. So, 5 *10=50 fours in tens place. Similarly, for 8's in tens place: blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, total 4*10 +9=49 eights in tens place. Now, hundreds place: For 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For 8's, hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 eights in hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. But I'm still a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but I think my calculations are correct. Let me just verify with a smaller number to see if the method works. Suppose I have a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. Counting 4's: units place:4,14 (2 times). Tens place:40-49, but since we only go to 20, none. Hundreds place: none. So, 2 fours. 8's: units place:8,18 (2 times). Tens place: none, because 80-89 is beyond 20. Hundreds place: none. So, 2 eights. Difference: 2-2=0. Using my method: units fours:20//10=2, units eights:20//10=2. Tens fours: 20//100=0, so 0. Tens eights:0. Hundreds:0. So, total fours:2, eights:2. Correct. Now, let's try another example: 100 pages. Counting 4's: units:100//10=10, since 100's units digit is 0, which is <4, so 10 fours. Tens: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, so 20 fours. Hundreds:400-499, but since we have only 100 pages, hundreds place has 0. So, total fours:10+20=30. 8's: units:100//10=10, since units digit is 0 <8, so 10. Tens:80-89:10, 180-189:10, but 100 pages, so 180-189 is beyond 100. So, only 80-89:10. So, total eights:10+10=20. Difference:30-20=10. Using my method: units fours:10, units eights:10. Tens fours:2*10=20, tens eights:1*10=10. So, total fours:30, eights:20. Difference:10. Correct. So, my method seems to work for smaller numbers. Therefore, I think my answer of 90 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " 440-449 is 10 numbers, and each contributes a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many sets there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then each hundred has another 10 numbers: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 4 sets in total. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is the last set before 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have a 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, then 89 + 89 = 178. So, total number of fours is 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does that count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Let's count how many sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have an 8 only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80.

Wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred block before 400, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-399, how many hundreds? 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. That's four blocks. Each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, we have another 10 numbers (440-449). So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

So, adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " So, how many sets are there? Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. The sets are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 end at 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers (including both 8 and 488). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count the sets: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The first four sets each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in fours. When I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, so 40, and the last set is 9, so total 49. That seems correct. Units place for eights: 8,18,...,488. That's 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. So, 98 eights total. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. So, I think my calculation is right. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four sets contribute 10 eights each, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 440-449 is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 doesn't have 4 in the tens place. So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is less than a full hundred. Let me correct that. Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. Now, 401-488: The tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. How many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place except possibly the last one. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each block contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me make sure. From 1-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but wait a minute, let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, yes, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, total 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought fours were 188, but let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. So, starting at 4, each 10 numbers. The last one is 484, which is 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1). So, 484 - 4 = 10*(n-1) \u2192 480 = 10*(n-1) \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,28,...,488. 488 is 8 in units place. So, same as fours, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I feel like 90 is a lot. Let me check if I counted correctly. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me see: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89 fours there. Tens place: 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 fours. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in counting problems, especially with higher digits, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For 4's: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 four, and then in the last partial group (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, total units fours: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full groups (each contributing 1 eight), and in the last group, 488 has an 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens fours: 5*10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: in each hundred, 80-89 contributes 10 eights. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 eights. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's: no numbers in the book have 8 in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting 90, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check another way. Maybe I can list out the counts for each digit position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 4,14,24,...,484 \u2192 49 numbers.\n- 8's:8,18,28,...,488 \u219249 numbers.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449 \u21925 sets of 10, so 50.\n- 8's:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488 \u2192 first four sets have 10 each, last set has 9, so 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:400-488 \u219289 numbers.\n- 8's: none.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " How many sets are there? Each set has 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1 to 488, we have hundreds from 0 to 4. Wait, actually, 0 isn't a hundred, but let's think in terms of hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many complete hundreds do we have? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400, 401, ..., 488. So, yes, 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, let me add them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488, which is 488 - 8 = 480, so 480/10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for the range 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Let's count how many sets there are. Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. The last set is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many, we can consider that the last number is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, yes, that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the tens place for 8. The sets are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49, which is correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.
