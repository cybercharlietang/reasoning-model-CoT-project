    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 fours. From 140-149: another 10. From 240-249: another 10. From 340-349: another 10. From 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: 9 eights (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, adding these up: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 400-488.  \n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - This sequence has 49 terms (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four sets contribute 10 eights each, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - There are no page numbers in the range 800-899, so 0 eights.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check if 488 is included. 488 is the last page, so yes, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, there's an 8 in the units place. How many? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8 is the first, 18 the second, up to 488 being the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four sets each have 10 eights, and the last set has 9. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's one set. From 0-99, 10-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, so 10 fours. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. Now, 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are there. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many 4's in units? Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one more because 488 has 8 in units, so the last 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units: 49. Tens place: as above, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Since the book goes up to 488, yes, 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts. Let me verify the units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, all these sets are valid.

Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.

Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, how many eights? Each full set contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) give 4*10=40 eights. The last set, 480-488, has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets, 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48. But since we include both endpoints, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of these contributes 10 eights except the last set, which contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188.

The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.

So, in the tens place, each set except the last contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? There are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count: Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.

Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Okay, so total fours are 188.

How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except the last one which might be less.

So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last set which contributes 9. Wait, no, actually, each set is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 49. Wait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 eights.

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8.

The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: (4*10) + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me check each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets with 10 each and 1 set with 9. So, 4x10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so 40-49 is one set, 140-149 is another, and so on. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in the units place? Let me divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8*50=400, but wait, 488 is 488, so from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. So, 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block has 10 numbers, so total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488).\n   - Full blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial block contributes 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 full decades, but wait, 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let me think: The number of terms in the sequence 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 10n - 2. Setting that equal to 488: 10n - 2 = 488 \u2192 10n = 490 \u2192 n = 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four sets contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights in total. Finally, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 sets, 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188.

The last number is 488, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which would be 49 numbers because 488 is included.

So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 50. Correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484: 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly for eights:8,18,...,488: same count, 49. Hundreds place: fours go from 400-488: 89 numbers, eights have none. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights are printed. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. For eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And for the tens place in fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, up to 484. So, 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct. For eights, units place: 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total fours: 188, eights:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 49 eights.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's count how many sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 40-49 (1 set), 140-149 (2nd set), 240-249 (3rd set), 340-349 (4th set), 440-449 (5th set). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the last set. Let's count how many sets there are. 80-89 (1 set), 180-189 (2nd set), 280-289 (3rd set), 380-389 (4th set), and 480-488 (partial set). Each full set contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The first four sets are full: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of 100 there are. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 fours). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 fours). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 fours). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 fours). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 fours). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. So, let's count how many sets: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me check again. For the tens place, eights appear in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89 is 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) and 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Hmm, so the difference is 90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. For example, in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place for fours, we have 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place for fours is 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units is 49, tens is 49, hundreds is 0, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place?

Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count the sets: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (another 10), 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four sets each contribute 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait a second, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.

Let's calculate how many terms are in this sequence. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d, where d=10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 => 488 -8 = (n-1)*10 => 480 = (n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each set. From 80-89: that's 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me think again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place. Let's count how many sets. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: how many? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for this last set. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for the fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 total fours. For eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.

    "text": " Let's count how many sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49 is one set (10 numbers), then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again because I think I might have made a mistake. Wait, no, actually, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many full sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 eights. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct. Now, for the eights. Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Then, the tens place for fours is 50, and units is 49. So, 89+50=139, plus 49 is 188. For eights, units is 49, tens is 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.

    "text": " Let's see: Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49 is the first block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, and 400-488: part of the fifth block. Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, because 400-439 have tens digits from 0-3, 440-449 have 4, and 450-488 have 5-8. So, actually, how many complete blocks are there? Let's list them: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each block has 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89: total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: total 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for eights. I said 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:49+50+89=188. Difference:90.

So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I said that in the tens place, fours appear in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10=40 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Hmm, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, did I count correctly in the tens place for eights? Let me check again. From 1-100: 80-89 (10). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49. So, total 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: 10 fours. From 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, so 488 is the last page. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens place can have 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: From 80-89: 10 eights. From 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, so in the tens place, how many eights are there in 480-488? The tens digit is 8, so each number from 480 to 488 has an 8 in the tens place. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, adding up: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each set contributes 10 eights except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many full sets of 100 there are. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there? Well, up to 488, so we have four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers, and there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. So, 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Let's count how many sets of 100 have the tens digit as 8. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89: total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49: total 98. Difference: 188-98=90.

From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it's 8 in the units place. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me check each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 0-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through the 4's again: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place:49. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, total 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, units and tens each have 49, so total 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, maybe I overcounted. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's, hundreds place is 0. So, 98 eights in total. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I have a feeling the answer might be different. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and sum them up. Let's try that.\n\nFor the 4's:\n\n- Units place: numbers ending with 4. From 4,14,...,484. As before, 484 is the last one. So, how many? (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: numbers where the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. That's 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: numbers ending with 8:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, which is 8 in units place. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\n- Tens place: numbers where the tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set from 480-488 has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: numbers where the hundreds digit is 8: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. But I thought maybe I was wrong earlier, but it seems consistent. Let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in a particular position is to use the formula:\n\nFor a digit d in position p (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated by:\n\ncount = higher * current_power + lower + (if current digit > d, add 1; if equal, add 1 and adjust for the lower part).\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. My initial method seems correct, so I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets of ten there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but again, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets with 10 each and one set with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many sets of 100 are there? From 1 to 488, there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500), but since 488 is less than 500, the last set is 401-488. Wait, no, actually, the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's a set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. That's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more fours. So, total fours in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Well, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing a 4 in the units place, plus one more for the 484, making it 49. So, units place is 49. Tens place: In each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds (1-400) would give 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? In each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, we have 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in the first four hundreds, each has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. In the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both endpoints). So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the units and tens for both fours and eights. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me check the last occurrence: 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, the first four sets contribute 4 * 10 = 40 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in terms of the hundreds digit being 4, each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488.

So, the tens place in 400-488 has 9 eights, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets \u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.

    "text": " Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 40-49: that's one set, 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have a 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many sets. 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400 to 488. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in those numbers, so each contributes one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many sets: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, how many sets? The first four sets (80-89, etc.) each have 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 488 is included). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Number of ranges: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences except the last, which contributes 10 (440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Number of full ranges: 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10.\n   - The last range (400-488) contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. The first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, another 10. Then 340-349, another 10. Then 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have missed something. Let me recount the fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 fours in the units place.

That's 5 sets, but the last set has only 9 numbers (480-488). So, each of the first four sets has 10 eights, and the last set has 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that?

So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, let me add up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 is 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98.

    "text": " Let me count how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each full hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place. But wait, from 1 to 488, does the first set start at 40-49? Yes, 40-49 is the first set. So that's 10 numbers, then each subsequent hundred adds another 10. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449). Wait, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 sets, but actually, from 40-49 is the first set, then each hundred adds another set. So, 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, from 8 to 488, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many full sets of 100 have a full 10 numbers where tens digit is 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10*4 +9 =40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 numbers). There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488. Wait, no, because 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, how many sets? 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last number is 488, which is 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers except the last one, which might be partial. The hundreds digit can be 0 (80-89), 1 (180-189), 2 (280-289), 3 (380-389), and 4 (480-488). So, that's 5 sets. The first four sets (0,1,2,3) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (4) contributes 9 eights (from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets \u00d710 =40, plus 9 from the last set, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me count how many full decades there are. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 101-200, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each have 10. Now, 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit place again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, each of these sets contributes 10 eights except the last one, 480-488. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then up to 488, which is 9 numbers (including both endpoints). So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Wait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place was 0, so total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
