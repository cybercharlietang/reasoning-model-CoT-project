    "text": " Next, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, from 8 to 488 with a step of 10. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks give 10 each, and the last block gives 9. So total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. \n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many tens places have 8. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which might be shorter. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. \n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. \n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. \n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

Let's find how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as one of the units place 8's? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, how many such blocks? There are 4 blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So that's correct. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: total 98. So difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block is 100 numbers, so 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, the tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Wait, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But let me check the tens place for eights again. I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That's correct. And for fours, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

The number of terms can be found by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Each hundred block (except maybe the last one) contributes 10 eights in the tens place.

So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. And for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 fours, so 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours. Similarly for eights: units place 49, tens place 49. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, totaling 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 8 + (48-1)*10 = 8 + 470 = 478, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. Let's solve for n: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. \n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but in the book, the last page is 488, so the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block if it doesn't complete 10 numbers. So:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the hundreds blocks:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u219210\n- 200-299:280-289\u219210\n- 300-399:380-389\u219210\n- 400-488:480-488\u21929\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

Let's find how many times that happens. The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let me check if 488 is included. 8,18,...,488: the positions are 8,18,...,488. To find the count, it's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. In the tens place, the sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, and the last set has 488-480+1=9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49. So, total eights:98. Fours:188. So, difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again. Is 488 included in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8, so that's counted in the units place. Similarly, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, which is why it's 9 numbers. So, yes, that seems correct.

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 8, 18, ..., 488. That's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and one partial decade contributing 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 90. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) gives 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) gives 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the units place, we have 49 eights, which is correct because from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. For the tens place, I have 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) each giving 10 eights, and the last partial set from 480-488 giving 9 eights, so 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, each of those 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens digit. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488:89 numbers. Each has a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nEights:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 488 is less than 800. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I double-counted some numbers? For example, when counting both units and tens, like 48: does it have both a 4 and an 8? But in this case, I'm counting the number of digits, not the number of numbers. So, each digit is counted separately, so 48 would have a 4 in the tens place and an 8 in the units place, so each digit is counted in their respective places. So, no double-counting issue here.\n\nAnother thing to check: when counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in eights, 480-488: does that include 488? Yes, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since 488 < 800).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Let's see, 488 is the last page, so how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of occurrences is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, how many numbers is that? Let's divide 488 by 10: 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many tens places have 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours and eights. Let me go through each digit place again for fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as 800 is beyond 488. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90.

Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. The first is 8, and the last is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's and 8's. Let me double-check the tens place for 4's. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For the 8's, units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So total eights: 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position more carefully. Let me try that. For the units place: numbers ending with 4 from 1 to 488. The first is 4, the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours. Similarly for 8's in units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights. Now, for the tens place: 4's. Numbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks: 5*10=50 fours. For 8's in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49 eights. Hundreds place: 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8's in hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours in the tens place. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5\u00d710=50, which is correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488: 488-400+1=89, correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. Let me set 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484 \u2192 (n-1)*10=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the last term. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 (n-1)*10=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Fours:49+50+89=188. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 eights, and the last partial block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let me go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but I need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, it's included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Let me see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it.

Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.
