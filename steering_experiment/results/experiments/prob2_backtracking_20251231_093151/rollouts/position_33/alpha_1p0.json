    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but does 488 count as the 49th? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, which would be the 49th 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have tens digit 8? Yes, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488 is part of the next block. How many numbers are there from 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, which is 4*10 +9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-489 would be another 10, but since the book stops at 488, it's only 9. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place for eights, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. But wait, 480 is 480, which is 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, 0 in units. 481 is 4,8,1, etc., up to 488, which is 4,8,8. So, yes, 9 numbers with 8 in tens place. So, 4*10 (from 80-89, 180-189, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488: 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Units place: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 49 times. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: 98 eights. Fours: 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):**\n     - 4 appears in page numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n     - This is every 10th number, starting at 4 and ending at 484.\n     - Total count: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):**\n     - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n     - Each range contributes 10 instances.\n     - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Total count: 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):**\n     - 4 appears in the hundreds place in page numbers 400-488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total count: 89 times.\n\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 8 appears in page numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n     - This is every 10th number, starting at 8 and ending at 488.\n     - Total count: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n     - Each range contributes 10 instances except the last, which contributes 9 (480-488).\n     - Total count: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n     - Total count: 0.\n\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, we have to check how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. Wait, 480-489 is the next set, but we only go up to 488, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block, which only contributes 9. So, how many full blocks do we have? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks up to 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488.\n   - Full blocks contribute 40 occurrences, and the partial block contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Now, let me check if I did that right. Wait, when I was counting the units place, I thought of 4, 14, ..., 484. Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 after that. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. So, units place is 49. Tens place: each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens place in 400-488 would still have 10 numbers each for 40-49, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit cycles through 0-9, but up to 8 in the hundreds place. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times per hundred. So, 100 numbers: 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Now, hundreds place: numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last one is 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189:10. 201-300:280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. 401-488:480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1 =9. So, yes, that's correct. So, tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 -98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counting because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's. Starting with 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens place: in each hundred block, 10 numbers with 4 in tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449: 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. But wait, does 488 count as having a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 4 in the hundreds, 8 in the tens, and 8 in the units. So, yes, 400-488 inclusive is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct. Now, for the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, that's correct. So, the total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens place in the hundreds: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as pages go up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should double-check that. Let me recount. Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many tens places have 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (because 488 is the last page). So, 10*4 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98? Wait, no, 49 + 49 is 98, but let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total eights are 98. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. So total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting fours, I had 188 fours. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   So, 89 fours.\n\n**Total fours:**\n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total eights:**\n\\[\n49 + 49 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but including 488, that's 49 numbers.

Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480-489 would be 10, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, right? Let me make sure. 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. So, 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Units place has 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the tens place, I thought of 80-89 as 10 numbers, which is correct, and there are four such blocks up to 380-389, then 480-488 as 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens, 49 in units, total 98 eights.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the 4's and 8's again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.

So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 /10 =48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nEights:\n\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10, last is 9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something in the tens place for eights. Let me check again. When counting the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 488 is the last page, so from 8 to 488, how many? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would be 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last number, the 49th occurrence is at 484. So, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), which is 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, making it 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Adding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would have tens digit 8, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488). So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one. Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, total eights are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the eights. In the tens place, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. That's correct.\n\nFor fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for hundreds place, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit place separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a formula. For each digit place, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count is:\n\nhigher = number formed by digits higher than the current digit position\ncurrent = current digit\nlower = number formed by digits lower than the current digit position\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, since the numbers are up to 488, which is less than 500, perhaps it's easier to break it down as I did before.\n\nWait, maybe I can cross-verify. Let me think about the number of 4's in the units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\nIn hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. For the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, yes, that's 9. So, 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, that seems right.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, we have 49 fours in the units place. Then tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred. So, in each hundred, except maybe the last one, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10, which is 40, but wait, 400-488 is part of the fourth hundred, so does 440-449 count? Yes, that's 10 numbers, so 5 sets? Wait, no, 40-49 is first, 140-149 second, 240-249 third, 340-349 fourth, and 440-449 fifth. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Then hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be next, but 488 is the last page. So, how many sets are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n\nThat's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 40 eights.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 occurs only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the hundreds digit 4. So, adding that to the other three sets (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4 sets of 10 is 40, plus 9 makes 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens was 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, we have 49 eights as calculated.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in the tens place, for the hundreds digit 4, it's 9 numbers, so 9 eights, and the other three hundreds contribute 10 each, so 3*10=30, plus 9=39? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me recount.\n\nWait, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred:\n\n- Hundreds digit 0: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- Hundreds digit 1: 180-189 (10)\n- Hundreds digit 2: 280-289 (10)\n- Hundreds digit 3: 380-389 (10)\n- Hundreds digit 4: 480-488 (9)\n\nSo, that's 5 sets, contributing 10,10,10,10,9 eights in the tens place, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place contributes 0, so total eights are 98.\n\nNow, let me go back to the fours. I had 188 fours. So, the difference would be 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. Number of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, so 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in fours. 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, fours have 50 and eights have 49.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 89.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Now, let me check if I did that right. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, the first 8 is at 8 (which is the 1st), then 18 (2nd), ..., 488 (49th). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, let me count how many full sets of 10 there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 40 (from 80-89, 180-189, etc.) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. Yeah, that seems correct. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last partial block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 (from four full blocks) + 9 (partial block) = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets and the partial set. Each full set (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " Maybe I should double-check that. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms, it's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place, each hundred has 10, so 4 sets (since 400-488 is part of the 400s). Wait, no, actually, it's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. And hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The last one is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, each of these blocks except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98.

But actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So that's correct.\n\nFor the 4's in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the 4's in the tens place, I included 440-449, which is within 488, so that's correct. So 5 sets of 10, 50 fours.\n\nAnd units place for 4's was 49.\n\nSo 49 +50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98.\n\nDifference is 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

Tens place: every 100 numbers, 10 times, so 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full sets, but wait, 400-499 would be the fifth set, but since we only go up to 488, it's still 5 sets? Wait, 400-488 is within the hundreds place, so yes, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is more than 100? Wait no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but in terms of tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds blocks are there? 400 is the start of the hundreds place, so from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds blocks: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, that's 5 hundreds blocks, but only the last one (400-488) has 89 numbers. Hmm, but for the tens place, each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so from 1-400, that's 4 times 10, which is 40, but then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So that's 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. That matches my earlier count. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of that. So, each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-400, we have 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 in the last partial set, totaling 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49, tens had 49, so total 98 eights. Let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one. So, 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours and eights to make sure. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Each of these blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place had 49 eights, tens had 49, so total is 98 eights. Hmm, let me check that again. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So yes, 49 in tens place. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 50, which comes from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place for 4's:49. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place for 8's, does 488 count as a units place 8? Yes, because 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is included in the units place count. So, units place has 49 eights, which includes 8,18,...,488.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's, 484 is included in the units place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I counted the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers here, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each set is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). So, 5*10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last set 480-488 has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.

There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). The first four blocks give 40 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) gives 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Each of these sets contributes 10 eights except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place for eights. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers; 180-189:10; 280-289:10; 380-389:10; and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.

Tens place: as I thought earlier, 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.

    "text": " Maybe I should double-check that. Wait, let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in the 484 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence). So, 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. For the tens place, each hundred has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers, so 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, how many numbers in each set? Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights each. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last set. So total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check again. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place. Each hundred block has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Now, 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, as 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check if I made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Wait, but I'm thinking maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems right. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89. Correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place: 49. So, 188 fours. Eights: units place, 49; tens place, 49. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try a different approach to verify. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately using a formula. For a given digit d, the number of times it appears in each position can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Units place:** The number of times d appears is floor(N/10) + (1 if the remainder is >= d else 0), where N is the total number of pages. Wait, but I think that's a bit more complicated. Alternatively, for units place, it's (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0). Wait, but in our case, d is 4 and 8. Let me try this for 4's in units place. N=488. So, 488 //10 =48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit more involved. The number of times d appears in the tens place is:\n\n- For each hundred block, there are 10 occurrences of d in the tens place.\n- The number of complete hundred blocks is N // 100.\n- Then, for the remaining part, if the tens digit is >=d, add 10 if the remaining part is >=10*d+10, else add the remaining part beyond 10*d.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of:\n\nNumber of times d appears in tens place = (N // 100) * 10 + extra, where extra is:\n\nIf the tens digit of N is greater than d, then add 10.\n\nIf the tens digit is equal to d, then add (N % 10 + 1).\n\nIf the tens digit is less than d, add 0.\n\nWait, let me apply this to 4's in the tens place.\n\nN=488.\n\nFirst, N//100=4 (since 4*100=400 <=488).\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the tens digit of N is 8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). Since 8 >4, we add 10. So, total is 40 +10=50. Correct, as we had before.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\nN=488.\n\nN//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nTens digit is 8, which is equal to d=8. So, we add (8 +1)=9. Wait, no, the formula says if the tens digit is equal to d, add (N%10 +1). N%10 is 8, so 8+1=9. So, total is 40 +9=49. Correct, as we had before.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times d appears in hundreds place is:\n\nIf d < current hundreds digit, then (current hundreds digit - d) * 100.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nNumber of hundreds where hundreds digit is 4 is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nNumber of hundreds where hundreds digit is 8 is from 800-899, but since N=488, there are none. So, 0 eights.\n\nSo, that confirms our earlier counts.\n\nThus, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.

So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place. Starting from 8, each 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. To find how many numbers, we can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1, so 49 times.

Let's see how many full sets we have. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets each contribute 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yeah, that's correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the tens place for the 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. And for 4's, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Again, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which might be cut short. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

Wait, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is included). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49.

Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49. Let's confirm. From 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 50. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.

Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where 8 is in the units place. So, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, how many sets? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, so that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for the tens place of 8's, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, so total eights: 98. That seems correct.\n\nFor the fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. So, 188-98=90.

For example, in the units place, 484 is counted once, and in the tens place, 440-449 are counted in both tens and hundreds? No, because in the hundreds place, we're only counting 400-488, which includes 440-449. But each digit position is counted separately, so it's okay to count each occurrence in each position.\n\nWait, but when I count the hundreds place, 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Similarly, the tens place for 4's includes 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. And units place is 49.\n\nSo, I think my count is correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if these are within 488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes, but 480-489 would be next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Wait, 480-489 is the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, how many sets do we have? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488, which is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens was 49, so total eights are 98. Wait, but let me double-check. Units place: from 8,18,...,488. That's (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights was 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, 444 would have been counted in both units and tens and hundreds, but each occurrence is counted separately, so that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears at 8,18,...,488. So that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within range, but 480-489 would include 480-488, which is part of the book. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last set. So total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount the tens place eights. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488-8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, eights: 49+49=98. Fours:188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So units place is 49, tens is 50, hundreds is 89, total 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so let's calculate: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place had 89 fours, but for eights, it's zero. So, total eights are 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights. Let me recount the tens place:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nYes, that's 49. Units place: 49, so total eights: 98.\n\nSo, fours:188, eights:98, difference:90.\n\nWait, but wait a second, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for fours again. 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, the hundreds place is zero because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no 800s.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again for eights. Is 480-488 correct? 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, yes.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted all the units and tens correctly. For units, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times. For tens, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for fours was 89, which is correct, but for eights, it's zero. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place for fours, I had 49, which is correct. For tens, 50, correct. Hundreds, 89, correct. So, 188 fours.\n\nFor eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, so 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I should double-check that. Wait, when I was counting the units place, I thought 484 is the 49th occurrence, but actually, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms can be calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 450-488 would have tens digits 5-8, so that's okay. So, 10 per hundred, 5 hundreds, so 50. Then the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

So that's 10*4 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, the last number is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, is that correct? Let me think: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, for the 400s, it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place in the hundreds would contribute 9 eights instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.

So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. Hmm, but wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit again. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? 484 is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => n = (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So units:49. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10, so 50. So, tens:50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units: from 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th number because 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place for fours, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct? Because 488-400+1=89. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Yes, that seems right. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights there. So, total eights:49. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.

    "text": " Let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is the last set. Each of these sets has 10 numbers, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, let me double-check that. Units place: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49, correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds place is 4 from 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in each hundred block. Let me think again. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Correct. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), which is 9, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, contributing 0.\n- Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
