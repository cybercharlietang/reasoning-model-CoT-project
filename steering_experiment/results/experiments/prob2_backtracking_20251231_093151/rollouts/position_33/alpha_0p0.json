    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8*49=488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one block of 9. So 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that's only up to 488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488.

    "text": " Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 488 is an extra. So, from 8 to 488, the units digit 8 appears 49 times. Wait, let me confirm: starting at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the others up to 380-389 is 10 each, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Wait, no, wait: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right.

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: from 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10. Solving for n: 488 = 8 + 10(n-1) \u2192 480 = 10(n-1) \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is okay, but 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, that's only up to 488. So, let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be another 10, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 more in 480-488. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 5 sets of 10 in the tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That also seems correct. Units place for both digits: 49 each. So, 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again: from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Correct. For eights in the hundreds place, none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 0. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place, I thought 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers. Let me check: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place, 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 exist? The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400, we have four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive).

The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three decades (180-189, etc.) is 10 each, so that's 40, and then 480-488 is 9, so total 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place. When I considered the tens place, I thought of 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me go through the counting again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with fours: units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: in each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Now for eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many numbers? The first is 8, which is the 8th number in the first ten. The last is 488, which is 488th page. To find how many, we can calculate how many numbers are 8 mod 10 up to 488. So, the count is floor((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place: as above, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89:10, each of the next three:10 each, so 40, and 480-488:9. So, total 49. So, eights:49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98.

    "text": " Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. So, how many sets? 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Hmm, let me verify: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the tens place calculation. When I did the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) has 9 eights. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 4,14,...484. How many? The formula is floor((488 -4)/10) +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (40-49 is the first, then 140-149, etc., up to 440-449). 5 blocks *10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...488. How many? (488-8)/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it's 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many full blocks we have. From 1-400, we have 400/100 = 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).

Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (except the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount that. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I feel like that's a lot. Let me check another way. Maybe I missed something in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. Okay, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same range. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first 8 is at 8, and the last one in the units place is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, is that correct? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems right. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me check the tens place for eights again. Wait, in the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. And for fours in the tens place, I had 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, that's (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. Same calculation: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90.

The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean 488 is included? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, starting at 8, each step is +10, so the nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Let's see when 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264 480 \u21d2 n-1 \u2264 48 \u21d2 n \u2264 49.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4*10=40.

So, the number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. To calculate this, we can consider how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, in each set, the units digit cycles from 0-9, so in each set, the 8 appears exactly once. So, 48 sets would give 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488, which is 8 more numbers. In those 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place.

    "text": " Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, I can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 50. But wait, the last set is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that set only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, instead of 10 eights in the tens place for that last set, we have 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I should recount the eights in the tens place. Let's see: Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). In each of these, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? - 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49, which matches what I had before. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers, which is correct. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98 eights. Fours:188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n   - Total = 4*10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 8th occurrence in the 480s. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. Let me confirm: 8*1=8, 8*2=16, but wait, no, it's every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 48 +1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th number ending with 8. Let me think: numbers ending with 8 from 1-488: 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
