Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we'll analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - The number of 4's in the units place is calculated by dividing 488 by 10 and taking the integer part: floor(488 / 10) = 48. However, since 484 is included, we add 1, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - The number of such pages is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Total = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - The number of 8's in the units place is calculated similarly: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Including 488, we get 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total = 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Total = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but earlier when I was counting units and tens for 8's, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. For tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last block. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489: but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours or the eights. Let me recount the fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10, and the last set is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For example, in the hundreds place for eights, since the book goes up to 488, there's no page 800, so no eights in the hundreds place. Correct. So, the difference is 90.

So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts. Let me recount the fours.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in ranges, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. For the tens place of fours, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. Now, for the eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 49 eights in the units, 49 in the tens, total 98. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit again. For fours: units place from 1 to 488. The first 4 in units is 4, and the last is 484. So, how many? Let's see: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. The formula is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place is 49. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89. 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...488. From 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, yes, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (Ones Place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
