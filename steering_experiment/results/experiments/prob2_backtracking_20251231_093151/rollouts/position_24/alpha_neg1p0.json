    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but from 400-488, the numbers are 400-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has 4 as the hundreds digit. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 8 * 61 = 488? Wait, no, 8 * 61 is 488. Wait, no, 8 * 60 = 480, so 488 is 8 * 61 = 488? Wait, 8*60=480, so 480 + 8 = 488. So, 488 is the 61st occurrence of 8 in the units place? Wait, no, because 8 occurs once every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, so yes, we include it. So, floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, we add 1, making it 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number. There are 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many hundreds are there? 400 is the 4th hundred. So, 4 hundreds each contribute 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last hundred is 400-488. Let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, and there are 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last hundred is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers. But the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would be in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, no. The tens digit is the second digit, so in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, right? Wait, no. Wait, 400-409: the hundreds digit is 4, tens digit is 0, units digit varies. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, in the hundreds 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, in the hundreds place, the 4 appears 10 times in the tens digit. But earlier I thought it's 40, but that's considering all hundreds up to 400. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify. The tens digit 4 occurs in every block of 100 numbers, starting from 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and a partial. Each full hundred contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. From 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in the following ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears 50 times. So, earlier I was wrong when I said 40; it's actually 50. So, units digit 4: 49, tens digit 4: 50, hundreds digit 4: 89 (from 400-488). So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, which is correct. Units digit 4: 49, tens digit 4: 50, hundreds digit 4: 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units digit 8 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, how many full hundreds? 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the 4's again. Units digit 4: 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens digit 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, 50 numbers. Correct. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49 +50 +89=188. For 8's: Units digit 8: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens digit 8: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds digit 8: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks within 1-488, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many hundreds do we have? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, because 440-449 is part of the 401-500 range, but since our book ends at 488, does that affect it? Let me think: 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but 400-499 would have 100 numbers, but we're stopping at 488, so does that affect the tens place in 440-449? No, because 440-449 is still within 401-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50. Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 pages, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-488) = 50. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89. So, adding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Now, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make off-by-one errors. For the units place of 4's: from 4, 14, ..., 484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. For the tens place of 4's: in each 100 numbers, 10 times. From 1-400, that's 400/100 = 4, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place, same as 4's: 49. Tens place: 40 from 1-400, and 9 from 480-488, so 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " There are four such blocks before 400: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 440-449. Let me count how many full hundreds are there. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, and 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's included. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 50 (from 400-488) = 90? Wait, no, that can't be right because from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds would be 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So total tens place fours: 40 + 50 = 90. Hmm, but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5\u00d710=50 numbers, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place from 400-488. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 50 = 90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 1-400, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but we're considering up to 488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, but the tens digit being 4 occurs in each hundred block. So, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so actually, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought from 1-400, it's 4 sets, but actually, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But 440-449 is within 400-488, so actually, the total number of tens place fours from 1-488 is 5\u00d710=50. So, I think I overcounted earlier by adding 40 and 50, but actually, it's just 50. Wait, no, because from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place from 1-488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50 fours. So, I think I was correct in the initial count of 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in page numbers from 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four, and then an extra 4 in 484, so 49 fours. That seems correct. Tens place: every 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 sets \u00d710=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50, which was wrong. Wait, no, let me clarify. From 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 50, but now I'm getting confused. Wait, no, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 40 fours. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. So, that's correct. Then, hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's the same as the number of 4's in the units place, except that 488 is included. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 eight, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 +1=49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights, so 4 sets \u00d710=40 eights. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 40 eights, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? There are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is in the units place. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. The total number of 8's in the units place would be the number of times 8 appears from 1 to 488. The formula is similar: (488 // 10) + 1 if the last digit is 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the 488 adds another one. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's four blocks, each contributing 10, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 eights. Therefore, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. But wait, the book goes up to 488, which is beyond 400. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. But wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, and so on up to 440-449. How many such decades are there? From 400 to 449, the tens digit is 4 for each decade. So, 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 decades, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but earlier I thought from 1-400 there are 4 blocks, each giving 10 fours, so 40 fours. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 more sets, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours. So total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) + 50 (from 400-488) = 90? Wait, that can't be right because from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in each hundred, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-449, which is 50 numbers, so 50 fours. So total tens place fours: 40 + 50 = 90. Hmm, but wait, 400-449 is 50 numbers, but 400-488 includes 400-449 and 450-488. Wait, no, 400-449 is 50 numbers, and 450-488 is another 39 numbers, but the tens digit in 450-488 is 5,6,7,8, etc., so it doesn't contribute to the 4's in the tens place. So, from 400-488, only 400-449 have 4's in the tens place, which is 50 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 50 (from 400-449) = 90. Wait, but 400 is included in both counts, so maybe I'm double-counting. Wait, no, because from 1-400, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 340-349. Then from 400-449, it's another 50 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 50 = 90. Okay, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (90) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 90 = 139, plus 89 is 228. Wait, 49 + 90 is 139, plus 89 is 228? Wait, 139 + 89 is 228? Let me check: 139 + 80 is 219, plus 9 is 228. Yes, that's correct. So, total fours: 228. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-400, there are four such hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 228 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 130. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with fours: units place: 49, tens place: 90, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 90 = 139, 139 + 89 = 228. That seems correct. For eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 228 - 98 = 130. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, I had 90 fours, which includes 40 from 1-400 and 50 from 400-449. Wait, but 400-449 is 50 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, so 50 fours. So, 40 + 50 = 90. That seems correct. Units place: 49 fours, correct.

    "text": " There are four such blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Wait, but 400-499 would be the fifth block, but our book only goes up to 488, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 sets of 10 numbers. Wait, no, each hundred block up to 400 would have 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, total tens place fours would be 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: from 1-488, how many hundreds blocks do we have? 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, in each of the first four blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449, which is 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 400-409 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So total tens fours are 40 (from first four blocks) + 50 (from the last partial block) = 90? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 400-488 is only 88 numbers, so the tens digit can't have 50 fours in that range. Wait, let me correct this. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each full hundred, like 1-100, there are 10 fours in the tens place (40-49). So, for 1-400, that's four full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. Wait, but 400-409 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 410-419, etc., each 10 numbers. How many such sets are there? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 5 sets: 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place from 400-488. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So total tens fours would be 40 (from 1-400) + 50 (from 401-488) = 90 fours. But wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 numbers, and the tens digit can't have 50 fours in that range. Wait, let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each of 10 numbers, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, total tens fours are 40 + 50 = 90. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place seems high. Let me check: 400-409: 10 numbers with tens digit 4. 410-419: another 10. 420-429: 10. 430-439: 10. 440-449: 10. That's 50 numbers, but in reality, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50 fours. So, total tens fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 50 (from 401-488) = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (90) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 90 = 139; 139 + 89 = 228. So, total fours: 228. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place (80-89). There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 228 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 130. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 90, hundreds 89. 49 + 90 = 139; 139 + 89 = 228. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 228 - 98 = 130. So, there are 130 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - For each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 occurrences.\n   - In 400-488, 4 appears in the tens place for 5 sets of 10 numbers (400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 (from 1-400) + 5 \u00d7 10 (from 400-488) = 40 + 50 = 90.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 90 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 228.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - For each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 occurrences.\n   - In 401-488, 8 appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n228 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 130.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 130.\n\n\\boxed{130}"

    "text": " There are 5 such blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488. Let me check how many full hundreds there are. From 1-400, there are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 fours. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. So total in the tens place is 40+10=50 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499. But since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 have 8 in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (including both 8 and 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 eights. So total in the tens place is 40+9=49 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct. Let me go through each digit again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And in the tens place for fours, I had 50, which was 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 440-449. That seems right. For eights, units place:49, which is correct because 488 is included. Tens place:49, which is 40 from the first four hundreds and 9 from 480-488. So, yes, 49. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digit positions, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 fours. That's correct. And in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, so 49 fours. So, total fours:89+50+49=188. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's would be 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total is 40 + 10 = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's would be 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many hundreds do we have? 1-100: 10 fours in the tens place. 101-200: another 10. 201-300: another 10. 301-400: another 10. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 within this range, but wait, 401-488 would have 40-49 in the 400s, but 401-488 includes 401-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, but wait, 400 is included in the 400s. Wait, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then from 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488. So, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in two places: 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (another 10 numbers). Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 400s, and 440-449 is another set. So, that's 20 fours in the tens place from 400-488. But wait, the total from 1-400 would be 4 sets of 10, so 40 fours. Then, from 401-488, we have 400-488, which includes 400-409 and 440-449, so that's 20 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so 20. But since 400 is included in 1-400, maybe I'm double-counting. Let me clarify: from 1-400, the tens digit 4 occurs 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers). But wait, 400-409 is within 401-488? No, 400 is the start of the 400s, so 400-409 is part of 401-488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in 400-409 and another 10 times in 440-449. So, that's 20 fours in the tens place from 401-488. But wait, 400 is included in 1-400, so the 40 fours in the tens place from 1-400 include 400-409. So, maybe I should adjust. Let me approach it differently. The total number of page numbers is 488. The number of times the tens digit is 4 is the number of complete hundreds times 10 plus any extra in the incomplete hundred. From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers) and 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 400-409 is part of 401-488? No, 400 is the start of the 400s, so 400-409 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10. So, that's 20 more fours in the tens place. But wait, 400 is included in 1-400, so the 40 fours already include 400-409. So, perhaps I should only add the fours in 440-449, which is 10 more. So, total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, and they are included in 1-400, so the 40 fours include those. Then, in 401-488, the next occurrence of the tens digit 4 is 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Hmm, that seems correct. Let me check: from 1-400, 40 fours in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times this happens. From 1-400, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place from 1-400. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. This totals 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. Each number in this range has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last number is 488, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, in the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count: Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89 (1 block), 180-189 (another), 280-289, and 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 480-488. How many numbers here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 fours. But wait, the last set is 400-499, but our book stops at 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. Wait, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, how many full decades have a tens digit of 4? Let's see: 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. But 480-489 goes up to 489, which is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, the number of full decades where the tens digit is 4 is from 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, which is 8 decades, each contributing 10 fours, so 8*10=80. Then, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, so the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 8 decades, each contributing 10 fours, so 80 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, that's 88 numbers beyond 400, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes up to 8 (for 480-488). So, the number of tens digits being 4 in 400-488 is 10 numbers (400-409), but wait, 400-409 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 410-419 is another 10, and so on up to 470-479, which is 8 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 8*10=80. Wait, no, because 400-409 is the first set, then 410-419, up to 470-479, which is 8 sets (since 400-470 is 70, but I'm counting each 10 as a set). Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times the tens digit is 4 in the entire range up to 488. Let me think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, that's 88 numbers. Wait, but 400 is included in the first 400, so maybe it's better to consider up to 488 as 4 hundreds (1-400) plus 88 more. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409), 10 numbers (410-419), up to 470-479, which is 8 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 8*10=80. Wait, but 400-409 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 410-419 is another 10, up to 470-479, which is 8 sets. So, 8*10=80 fours in the tens place from 400-488. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, the number of tens digits being 4 in 400-488 is 8 sets of 10, which is 80, but 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 another 10, etc., up to 470-479, which is 8 sets, so 80 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 80 (from 400-488). Wait, but that can't be right because 400-488 is part of the 1-488 range. Wait, perhaps I'm double-counting. Let me correct this. The correct way is to consider the entire range 1-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, total tens place fours are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. So, total fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 is the 49th number. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks are fully included and how many are partially included. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 \u2192 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights. Then, from 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers here have 8 in the tens place? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each having 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for fours. Earlier, I thought there were 50 fours in the tens place, but let me recount. The tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 50+89=139, plus 49 is 188. For eights: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, so 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\frac{484}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.\n   - Total ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[ 49 \\text{ (units)} + 50 \\text{ (tens)} + 89 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\frac{488}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last range which is partial.\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 5 ranges.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) (since 480-488 has 9 numbers).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[ 49 \\text{ (units)} + 49 \\text{ (tens)} + 0 \\text{ (hundreds)} = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[ 188 \\text{ (4's)} - 98 \\text{ (8's)} = 90 \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. The number of such numbers is 488 / 10 = 48.8, which we take the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence starting from 8. Let me think: 8 is the 1st, 18 is the 2nd, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights would be 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights, correct. Tens place: 40 from 1-400, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. So total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but in the hundreds place, it's zero, so total is 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the units place of 4's: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 48 full decades, but since 484 is included, it's 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Wait, earlier I thought 4 sets from 1-400, but actually, from 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, 440-449 is another 10, so total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. For eights: units place, 49 eights, correct. Tens place: 40 from 1-400, and 9 from 480-488, total 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):**\n     - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484 inclusive).\n\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):**\n     - The digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100 numbers, each contributing 10 occurrences \u2192 4\u00d710=40.\n     - From 400-488: 440-449 contributes another 10 occurrences.\n     - Total occurrences: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):**\n     - The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488 inclusive).\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit 8 appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100 numbers, each contributing 10 occurrences \u2192 4\u00d710=40.\n     - From 400-488: 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n     - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n     - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " There are four such blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488. Let's see: From 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449: 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So yes, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So: From 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 201-300: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 301-400: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 401-488: 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188: 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188-98=90? Let me check: 188-98: 188-90=98, then -8 more is 90. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the number of 4's or 8's. Let me double-check. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct. And the other blocks each have 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems right. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. That seems correct. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not right. From 1-400, it's 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total is 50. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, but the tens digit being 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the 400-499 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 440-449, etc., but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. So, how many full hundreds are there? From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, how many fours in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. But wait, 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's 10 fours, and 440-449 is another 10, but does 488 include up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10. So, total in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (400-409) plus 10 (440-449) = 60 fours. Wait, but wait, no, because from 1-400, the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (which is part of 401-488), so that's 10, and 440-449, another 10. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 + 10 = 60 fours. Wait, but 400-409 is part of the 401-488 range, so yes, that's 10. Similarly, 440-449 is another 10. So, 60 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (60) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 60 = 109 + 89 = 198 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, that's 49 numbers. So units place is 49. Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 20. So, 40 + 20 = 60. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours: 49 + 60 + 89 = 198. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), because 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So, tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, is that right? Let me think: in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems correct. So, total fours: 198, total eights: 98. The difference is 198 - 98 = 100.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but let me make sure. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then from 401-488, the 440-449 is 10 more. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so we have these sets. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, how many hundreds? 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-400, we have 4 sets of 10 eights in the tens place, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. And units place: 49 eights, same as 4's. So, yes, 49+49=98. And 4's are 188. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see: 1-100: 10 fours in tens place. 101-200: another 10. 201-300: another 10. 301-400: another 10. Now, 401-488: The tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but wait, 401-488: from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 fours. So total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-499. But the book only goes up to 488, so it's 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 +50=99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8, 18, ..., 488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). But in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in tens place, 481 same, up to 488. So, 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (401-488) = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49 +49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the ranges. Let me recheck the fours count: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that hundred, which is another 10 numbers (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 fours? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because from 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is another 10 numbers, so 40+10=50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 occurrences. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40 eights. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is another 10 numbers (480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10). Wait, that's a mistake. Let me correct that. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights would be 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n   - From 400-488: 10 more (440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10, totaling 40.\n   - From 400-488: 9 more (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in 1-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, for each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, the last hundred is 401-500, but our book only goes up to 488, so the 400s go up to 488. So, the 440-449 is within that. So, the tens place has 4 sets of 10, so 40 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, then 89 + 89 = 178. So, there are 178 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488/10 = 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in the range 401-488, does the tens digit ever reach 8? The next set would be 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480,481,...,488). So, that's an additional 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 178 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 80. So, there are 80 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 after 0. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8 because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 contributes 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and 9 from 480-488. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the number of 4's. Units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24,...,484. How many? From 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred has 10 numbers. Up to 488, we have 400-488, which is the fifth hundred. So, 5 sets \u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check if 488 is included correctly. In the units place, 488 has an 8 in units, so that's counted. In the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 such numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " There are four such blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block (401-500) will only go up to 488. So, in the 401-488 range, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many complete blocks do we have? The first block is 1-100: 10 fours. Second block 101-200: 10 fours. Third block 201-300: 10 fours. Fourth block 301-400: 10 fours. Fifth block 401-488: Here, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 401-488 includes 440-449. Yes, because 440 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 fours. So, total 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so it's from 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which might be less. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total 10*4 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks within 1-488.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many blocks do we have? 400 divided by 100 is 4. So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 fours in the tens place. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, no, that's not right. The tens digit is 4 in the 400s as 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, the 400s go up to 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 only when the tens digit is 4, so for each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit could be 4 again in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens digit 4's would be 4*10 + 10 = 50? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. From 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is still within that. So, how many blocks of 100 have the tens digit as 4? Each block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit being 4 occurs when the tens digit is 4, so in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480-489 would be 10, but we stop at 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). Wait, that's 8 full tens blocks and one partial. So, 8*10 + 9=89? That can't be right because from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The number of times the tens digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete hundreds times 10 plus any extra in the partial hundred. From 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10. So total tens digit 4's would be 40 + 10=50. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but in 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's the same as in any hundred: 10 times. Because 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, then in 410-419, the tens digit is 1, not 4. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think: the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, right? Wait no, 400 is 4 0 0, so tens digit is 0. 401 is 4 0 1, tens digit 0. 410 is 4 1 0, tens digit 1. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. The tens digit is 4 when the second digit is 4. So, in 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the next block where the tens digit is 4 would be 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens digit 4's would be 40 + 10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's another 10. So, total tens digit 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms are in this sequence? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers each = 40 occurrences.\n   - From 400-488: 440-449 contributes another 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Number of such numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 numbers each = 40 occurrences.\n   - From 400-488: 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, in each complete block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.

I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count: Each complete block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the difference is number of fours (188) minus number of eights (98) = 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number from 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence.

Each set contributes 10 numbers. So, 1-400: 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights would be 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Okay. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " There are 5 such blocks up to 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 400-488. So, for each complete block (like 1-100, 200-300, 300-400), there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that block, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit being 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, right? Wait, no, that's the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is a set of 10 numbers. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Let me see: 40-49 is in 1-100, then 140-149 in 100-200, 240-249 in 200-300, 340-349 in 300-400, and 440-449 in 400-500. But since our book ends at 488, the last set is 440-449, which is fully included. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets we have. Each set contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So that's another 10. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, let me think again. From 1-400, it's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 401-488, the 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total is 40 + 10 = 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40, plus 440-449 gives 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The difference between terms is 10, so number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens place in 480-488 contributes 9 eights, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just cross-verify. Wait, when I counted the tens place for 8's, I thought that from 1-400, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 40 +9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. For fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{90} more 4's printed than 8's."

Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49.

So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more fours than eights there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but the book ends at 488. So, how many such blocks? Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. This is 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count: Each hundred contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1-100: 40-49 is 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149 is another 10 fours. 201-300: 240-249 is another 10. 301-400: 340-349 is another 10. 401-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488 has the tens digit as 8. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8 in this book. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

In 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409 and 440-449. Wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10 numbers, but 488 is less than 500, so does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 20 numbers (10 from 400-409 and 10 from 440-449). Therefore, the total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 4*10 (from 1-400) plus 20 (from 400-488). Wait, that would be 40 + 20 = 60. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, which is 20 numbers. So, total is 4*10 + 20 = 60. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the tens digit cycles every 100, but in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in two blocks: 400-409 and 440-449. So, that's 10 + 10 = 20 numbers. So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 20 (from 400-488) = 60. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 60 = 109, 109 + 89 = 198. So, total 4's: 198.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, we can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-400, the tens digit is 8 in each block of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 4 blocks give 4*10=40.\n\nNow, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 198 - 98 = 100.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 60\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 60 = 109; 109 + 89 = 198. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 198 - 98 = 100.

But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 1-100: 10 fours (40-49), 101-200: 10 fours (140-149), 201-300: 10 fours (240-249), 301-400: 10 fours (340-349). That's 4 sets, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the next set where tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there from 400-488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers, correct. Tens place: each hundred block has 10, so 4 blocks give 40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? From 1-400, we have 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the next block is 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit.

So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Hmm, wait, let me check again. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149: another 10. 200-299: 240-249: another 10. 300-399: 340-349: another 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10. So that's 10*5=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, but wait, 48*10=480, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: as above, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400: 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place: 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 is part of the 480-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, because from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but each of those contributes one 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49. Hmm, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours. But wait, does the 488 page mean that in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449? So, from 400-449, there are 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4, but actually, 400-499 would have 100 numbers, but we only go up to 488. So, from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? Let's see: 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, only 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. So, total tens place fours would be from 1-399: 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Plus the 10 from 400-488, so total 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought that in each 100 numbers, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times, so from 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449). So total tens place fours are 40+10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but the last partial ten (480-488) includes 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 fours. From 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40+10=50. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 sets, so 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. So total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm not sure if I counted correctly. Let me recount the tens place for fours. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place: from 1-400, 4*10=40. From 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place for both fours and eights is 49 each. So, fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

So, total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, tens digit is 4 in 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, and 340-349, each adding 10. So, up to 400, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours would be 40+10=50.

From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's.

Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in one block of 10 numbers. So, in 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4*10=40 (from 1-400) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is less than 500, we don't go beyond that. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 400-488) equals 50 fours.

The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is >=4. 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1, making it 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Tens place: For each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next hundred would be 400-499, but we only go up to 488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, we add 1. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 40.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 40.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, contributing 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is in the 400-488 range, which is the fourth hundred. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. But wait, the 400-488 range: from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges in total. Wait, but from 1 to 488, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me go through the same process. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included. So, how many numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, we can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which might be less. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets \u00d710 + 1 set \u00d79 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: number of 4's (188) - number of 8's (98) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, occurring 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9. This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
