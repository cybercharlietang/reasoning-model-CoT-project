    "text": " Let's see how many full blocks of 100 there are in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 more fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 times). So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. In the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, hundreds place eights are 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49 (since 484 is the last one, which is 484/10 + 1 = 49)\n- Tens: 50 (40 in full hundreds, 10 in 440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49 (since 488 is included, which is the 49th)\n- Tens: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (480-488) = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see: from 1-99, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Then from 100-199, it's another 10 (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 10 (240-249), 300-399: 10 (340-349), and 400-488: here, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, when I counted the units place, I thought it was 49, but maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that: 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the number of times is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 8 more numbers (481-488) which include 484 as the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: from 40-49, 140-149, etc., as I thought earlier, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place, plus the 488th page, which is 488, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So total tens place eights: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts because 90 seems a bit high. Let me recount the fours and eights again.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49 (from 8,18,...,488)\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct. Similarly, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so that's correct. For eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last range is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place within 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see how many full blocks of 100 there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block (401-488). In each full block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Now, the partial block is 401-488. In the tens place, 40-49 would be 40-49, but in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, the total tens place fours are 40 (from the four full blocks) + 10 (from the partial block) = 50. Hmm, but wait, let me check again. The first four blocks (1-400) would each have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total 40+10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, we can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block of 100 (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 4 full blocks (1-400), so 4\u00d710=40 eights. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place eights: 40 (from full blocks) + 9 (from partial block) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours in the tens place. I had 50 fours in the tens place, but when I added up, it was 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for fours, I had 50 fours. Let me recount that. From 1-400, each 100 has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, for fours, from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nFor eights, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: no eights, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits. Let me see, from 1-9:9 numbers, 1 digit each:9 digits. 10-99:90 numbers, 2 digits each:180 digits. 100-488:389 numbers, 3 digits each:1167 digits. Total digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total digits with fours:188 fours. Each four contributes 1 digit, so 188 digits. Similarly, eights:98 digits.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of terms} = \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred contains 10 such numbers, and there are 4 full hundreds (1-400).

    "text": " Let's see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So yes, that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many complete sets there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let's see how many complete sets of 100 we have. From 1-400, there are four sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, no, that's five sets because 400-449 is another set, but 440-449 is within 400-449. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 5*10=50 fours. Wait, but let me check the last set: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th number. Wait, but 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49th occurrence. Wait, no: 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see: from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in units place? It's floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, so it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, we have 40-49 (no, that's units), wait no, in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each set is 10 numbers. Let's see how many complete sets there are. From 1-400, there are four sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the next set would be 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking the number of 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...488. That's 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, units and tens each have 49, totaling 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo find this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n- **Units place:** '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate that: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is included, so 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units place 8's go up to 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets there are. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each of the first four sets contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For eights, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one set of 9, so 49. So, 49 eights in tens place, 49 in units, total 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me think: from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, from 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 more. 300-399: 340-349, 10 more. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 10 for each hundred block, and there are 4 hundred blocks (1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400). Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is still 10 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. Wait, earlier I thought 4 blocks, but actually, from 1-400, there are 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and then 440-449 is the fifth set. So, yes, 5 sets, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit, which is 4 in all these numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers is that? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 100-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: how many numbers? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 numbers. So, adding up: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's correct. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go back to counting fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which would mean 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10 numbers, and the last set is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - These numbers occur every 10 pages.\n   - The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484.\n   - Number of 4's: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each set of 100 pages contains 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place.\n   - There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - All pages from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - These numbers occur every 10 pages.\n   - The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each set of 100 pages contains 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last set.\n   - The first four sets contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The last set (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many sets of 100 are there? 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's an additional 10 fours. So total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only when the tens place is 4, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 4 sets of 10 (from 1-400) plus 10 from 440-449, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such sets are there up to 488. From 1-400, there are 4 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each set contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. This gives 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no page numbers from 800-899.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's see how many complete hundreds we have. From 1-488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens place in each hundred block. So, for 0-99, 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, 140-149: another 10. In 200-299, 240-249: another 10. In 300-399, 340-349: another 10. In 400-488, 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many hundred blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block is only up to 488, not 499. However, the tens digit 4 in 400-488 only goes up to 449, which is within 488, so we still have a full 10 numbers there. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 fours = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many, we can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. For each hundred block: 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's calculate: 4 blocks (0-399) contribute 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block (400-488) contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recount the fours and eights. **Rechecking Fours:**\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place. From 0-488, there are 5 hundred blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Each except the last contributes 10, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 goes up to 449, which is within 488. So, 10 fours in the tens place for each of the 5 blocks. So, 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Rechecking Eights:**\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488. Correct.\nTotal eights:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see: from 1-488, how many full decades are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, 401-488 includes 400-488. Wait, no, 401-488 is after 400, so the tens digit in 401-488 would be 0 for 401-409, then 1 for 410-419, etc., up to 8 for 480-488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, right? So, that's another 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, total tens place fours would be 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 10 is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place from these. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. When I counted the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. But wait, in the hundreds place, we go up to 488, so in the hundreds place, the hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But when considering the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, adding 10 to the previous 40, making 50. Similarly, for the 8's in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights. So, total 49 in the tens place. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so 400-488 is 89 numbers.

The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480+1=9. So, the first four sets (80-89, etc.) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This occurs every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, ..., 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This occurs every 10 numbers, starting from 8 up to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences except the last one (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see: From 1-99, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that's correct. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Let's do the same approach for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me confirm: from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that's 49? Let me add again: 10 +10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Yes, correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, so total 98. That seems correct because from 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so only units and tens places contribute. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " So, from 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but let's check the last number. 488 is the last page, which is 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. How many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 8 can appear in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

From 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, total tens place fours: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50 fours. Wait, but wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and since 488 is higher, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, so 8+1=9. So, in the tens place, we have 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the fours in the tens place, I had 50 fours. Let me recount that. From 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 4,14,...,484. As I thought earlier, that's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nSo, total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights, units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book ends at 488, so no 800s.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.

From 401-500, it's 440-449, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488? No, 440-449 is within 401-500, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is still within the book. So, that's another 10. So, how many sets is that? From 1-400, we have 4 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each giving 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, we have 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place fours would be 40+10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488 - 8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-100: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 180-189, another 10. From 201-300: 280-289, 10 more. From 301-400: 380-389, 10 more. From 401-500: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, so 49. Wait, no, let me recount. From 1-400, we have 4 sets (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Wait, earlier I thought from 1-400, it's 4 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349), each 10, so 40, and then 440-449 is another 10, making 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 in tens place. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) and 9, total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: None. So, 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Wait, in the tens place for fours, I included 440-449, which is within 401-488, so that's correct. And in the tens place for eights, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. I think my counts are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check how many complete sets we have. Each set of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 1-100, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, 10 eights in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " From 1-488, how many complete decades are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 fours, but since 484 is included, that's 49. So units: 49. Tens place: in each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens: 40+10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89= 188. Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. 8's can be in units, tens, or hundreds place. Let's do the same breakdown. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the book. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, how many more fours than eights? 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's the calculation. But I'm a bit unsure because I might have overcounted somewhere. Let me check again. Units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers ending with 4? The first is 4, last is 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: in each hundred, 10 numbers. 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers. So total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So fours total 188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10. 4 hundreds: 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, 480-488: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Correct. So eights total 98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place.

    "text": " Let me think: from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. From 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10. From 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. From 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 occurrences. Let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check up to 488. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers.

So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, that's 9. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within the book's pages. Let's count each set. From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, etc.) and 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, except the last range (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 300-400, 340-349, another 10. From 400-488, 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count: from 1-100, 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-200, 180-189 is another 10. From 200-300, 280-289 is another 10. From 300-400, 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for fours:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each set has 10 except the last, which has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** None, as 800-899 exceeds 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Then, from 401-488, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's another 10. So total tens place fours are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count: Each full hundred (1-100, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens place is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, since 489 is beyond 488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Then 100-200 includes 140-149, another 10. 200-300 includes 240-249, another 10. 300-400 includes 340-349, another 10. Now, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only have 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but the book only goes up to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check again because I might have overcounted. Wait, when I'm counting the hundreds place, I'm considering all numbers from 400 to 488, which is correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks there are. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Now, does 480-489 count? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. Wait, no, 480-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm seeing 49. Wait, no, because 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each has a 4 in hundreds place. So 89. So total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not right. Because in the first four blocks, each has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50. So units place had 49, tens place has 50. Now, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit place similarly. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 eights in the tens place. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me verify the count of 4's again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, for 8's: Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 40 (from first four blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So total 98 eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - The sequence starts at 4 and ends at 484.  \n   - Number of 4's = (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 100-199, etc.) has 10 such numbers.  \n   - There are four complete hundred blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - In the last block (400-488), 440-449 contributes another 10.  \n   - Total tens place 4's = 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of pages = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - The sequence starts at 8 and ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's = (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each hundred block contributes 10, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - In the last block (400-488), 480-488 contributes 9.  \n   - Total tens place 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see: from 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10 more. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers because 440 to 449 is within 488. So that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, 89 + 89 = 178. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each set has 10 numbers, and there are 4 such sets (since 400-488 is the fourth set), so 4*10=40. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So total fours: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me list them: 8,18,28,...,488. Each step is +10, starting at 8. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 488, so 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), because 489 is beyond 488. So, the first four sets have 10 each, and the last set has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that seems high. Wait, 49 in units, 49 in tens, so 98 eights total. Now, the number of fours is 178, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 178 - 98 = 80. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the fours: Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but actually, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So total fours:49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that's different from before. So, earlier I thought 4 sets in the tens place, but actually, it's 5 sets. Let me clarify: The page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4, but the tens digit can be 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, for the eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total eights:98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, now I'm getting a different answer. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of the tens place for fours. Let me verify again. For the tens place, when the hundreds digit is 4 (i.e., 400-488), the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. So, my initial count was wrong; it's 50, not 40. Therefore, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, eights: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0) = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but earlier I thought 178-98=80, but now it's 188-98=90. Which one is correct? Let me check again. Units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? The last number is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). So, 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (n-1)*10=480, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as the book ends at 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think: from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-200, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8, but 488 is included. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights, except maybe the last one. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98.

    "text": " From 1-488, how many complete decades are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, but 401-488 isn't a complete hundred. So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, from 1-400, that's 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 40-49 would be in 401-488? Wait, no. 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so the tens digit can be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the units digits go up to 8 as well. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that adds another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is in the units place. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each complete hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the fours: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the eights: units place 49, tens place 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait a second, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 401-488 as contributing 10 fours, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's correct. For the eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 480 is included but 489 is beyond 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

From 400-488: 440-449, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, and 449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, total in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, from 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 in total. Hmm, wait, no, from 1-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10, so that's 5 times 10, which is 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, no, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. Starting from 8, each 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, let's count: From 1-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let's see: from 1-488, how many complete groups of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50. So, the tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500), but we only go up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens place 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds x 10 = 40, plus 10 makes 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

From 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. From 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, the tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can have 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 in the units place occurs at 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The first is 8, last is 488. The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

So, the tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8.

So, the tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, we can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That is (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. From 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred. So, 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 pages beyond 400, so the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409 and 440-449. So, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so 20 fours in the tens place from 400-488. Therefore, total fours in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 20 (from 400-488), but wait, that would be double-counting the 400-409 and 440-449. Wait, no, because in the 1-400 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, which is 4 sets of 10, so 40 fours. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, which is 20 fours. So total fours in the tens place would be 40 + 20 = 60. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 fours. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, but 400-409 is part of 401-488, so that's 10 fours, and 440-449 is another 10, so 20 fours. So total tens fours would be 40 + 20 = 60. Hmm, that seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in page numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (60) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 60 = 109, 109 + 89 = 198. So, total fours printed: 198. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480s, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me verify. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred (except maybe the last one) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens eights: 40 + 9 = 49. That matches. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 198 - 98 = 100. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens place: 60, hundreds place: 89. Total: 198. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:100. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for fours again. I had 40 fours in the tens place from 1-400, and then 20 more from 400-488, making 60. Wait, but in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449, which is 20 numbers, so 20 fours. So, 40 + 20 = 60. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 4 sets of 10, so 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Units place for both fours and eights is 49 each, since 488 is included. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours exceeds the number of eights by 100.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) = 40 occurrences.  \n   - From 400-488: 400-409 and 440-449 = 20 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 40 + 20 = 60.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 60 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **198**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40 occurrences.  \n   - From 401-488: 480-488 = 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n198 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **100**.\n\n$\\boxed{100}$"

    "text": " Let me see how many complete blocks of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 times 10 = 40 fours in the tens place from the complete hundreds. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total fours in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, then 401, 402,... up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 488 is the last page. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each complete hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so that's 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights in hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

So, the tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.

Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers.

From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, adding them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.

So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so yes, 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 49 numbers (since 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are.

So, for the tens place, from 400-488, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right because when I added up the fours, I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Units place for 4's: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds: 89. Total 4's: 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188. That's correct. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I feel like I might have overcounted somewhere. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently, counting digit by digit more carefully. Let me try another method to confirm. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count how many times 4 and 8 appear. Starting with 4's: Units place: For each page number, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48 full groups (10 each), giving 48 fours, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) where the units digit is 1-8. So, in the units place, 48 fours, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, plus in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. Wait, that contradicts my earlier count. So, units place for 4's: 48? But earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: The first page with a 4 in the units place is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. How many terms are there? The nth term is 10n - 6 = 484? Wait, no. Alternatively, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, my initial count was correct. So, units place:49 fours. Similarly, for 8's in units place: The first is 8, then 18, 28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 2 = 488? Let's see: 10n - 2 = 488 \u2192 10n = 490 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. That's correct. Now, tens place for 4's: As before, 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-400: 4 blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks (1-399) contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. The last block, 400-488, has 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Now, hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. For 8's in hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights there. Now, adding up: 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188. 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each 100-number block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each 100-number block contributes 10, except the last which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think: from 0-99, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49). Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. From 200-299, 240-249, another 10. From 300-399, 340-349, another 10. From 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 in 400-488. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours than eights, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that looks correct. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 ends with 88, so the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 - 280-289: 10 - 380-389: 10 - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: from 0-99, 80-89 is 10. Then 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me see: from 1-488, how many complete groups of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. In each of these, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100). So that's 4*10 = 40 fours. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 400-409 and 440-449. Wait, no, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, not 4. Wait, no, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, 410-419: tens digit is 1, 420-429: tens digit is 2, 430-439: tens digit is 3, 440-449: tens digit is 4. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, adding that to the previous 40, we get 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, which would be 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, another 10 fours in the tens place (440-449). So total is 50. Hmm, that seems right. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. Wait, but the hundreds digit can only be 4 in 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. Total: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488. So, let's count. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds? 4 hundreds. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, so fours are 188 and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me check the fours again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 0 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then in 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so total 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. Eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then in 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so total 49. Correct. So, eights:49+49=98.
