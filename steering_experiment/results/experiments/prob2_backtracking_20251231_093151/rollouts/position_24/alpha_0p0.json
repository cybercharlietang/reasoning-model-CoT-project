    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, how many blocks is that? From 1-400, there are four blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, we have another 10 fours in 440-449. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait: 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 fours, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only counting the hundreds digit, which is 4 in all these numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. - 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. - 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. - 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. - 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks *10 =40, plus 9 from the last block, total 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (440-449) also contributes 10.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as a units place 8? Yes, because 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: From 1-100: 80-89 (10). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, total tens place eights are 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's.

    "text": " From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, so 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no. Wait, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so that's 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total is 40 +10=50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 +50=99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 -8)/10 +1. Let me compute that: (488-8)=480, 480/10=48, so 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, that's 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

Wait, no, because from 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would give 40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens place 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50. Wait, but actually, from 1-400, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next block is 400-499, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours: 40+10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 49 numbers (since 488 is included). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought from 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40, and then 440-449 adds another 10, making it 50. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40, and then from 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct too. Units place for both fours and eights is 49 each, which makes sense because up to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except maybe the last partial set. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 full decades, so 49 occurrences of both 4 and 8 in the units place. So, that's correct. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, difference is 90.

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-499 would have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is included, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) plus 10 from 401-488, totaling 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but only up to 488, so 9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 440-449 is another 10, so 50 in total. That seems right. For 8's, in the tens place, from 1-400, 4 blocks, each 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89. That's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

From 440-449, there are 10 more, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That would be 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, from 1-400, it's actually 400/100 = 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next set where tens digit is 4 is 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. But wait, does 400-488 include 440-449? Yes, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. From 1-400, 4 sets of 100, each with 10 eights in tens place: 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the next set is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 49 + 49 is 98, correct. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. That seems correct.

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

Let's count how many full blocks there are. Each 100 numbers contribute 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each giving 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total eights from total fours: 188 - 98 = 90.

From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.

Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

From 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. From 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the last set. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10+10+10+9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, for the units place fours, I had 49, which seems correct because from 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers. For tens place fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50, but wait, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours there.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 49 eights, correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9).

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? Well, 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers), 101-200: 140-149 (10), 201-300: 240-249 (10), 301-400: 340-349 (10). Then, from 401-488, we have 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the fifth block. But in the tens place, the 4 can appear in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, how many complete hundreds are there? From 0-400, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens fours: 40 +10=50. That's correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-488 is part of this range. So, how many sets? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 sets. Each of the first four sets (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the tens digit 8, in each hundred block, it's 10 numbers. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10). Then, 400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 10*4=40 plus 9=49. That's correct. So, total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for fours. Let's see: hundreds digit 4 is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct. Units digit 4: from 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Tens digit 4: from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. So, 49+50+89=188.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that adds 10, making it 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position similarly. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, so there are 49 numbers (since 488 is the 49th occurrence). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but I thought each block contributes 10, but in the last block, it's only 9 because we stop at 488. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total eights from the total fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. Tens place for fours: from 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, so 20. 240-249: 30. 340-349:40. 440-449:50. So yes, 50 fours in the tens place. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units: 4,14,...,484: 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 188 fours. For eights: units=49, tens=49. So, 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 blocks (1-400) would be 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the units digit. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just verify the counts again to be sure. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers from 800-899 exist in a 488-page book.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, the tens place contributions are: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, 10. From 301-400: 340-349, 10. From 401-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, no, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds one. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so it's only up to 488. So, let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which gives 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But the book ends at 488, so let's check how many complete blocks there are. Each 100 numbers contribute 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10 = 40 eights. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks (each 100 numbers) contribute 10 each, and then 440-449 is another 10, so 4*10 +10=50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, let's count how many such numbers. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, we can calculate (488 -8)/10 +1. (488-8)=480, 480/10=48, 48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the book. Let's count each block. From 1-400, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights are 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought maybe it's 90, but let me double-check my counts. Let me recheck the fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks in total? Wait, no, from 0-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then from 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 4*10 +10=50. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both fours and eights: 49 each. So, fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10, and from 401-488, another 10.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10, and from 401-488, another 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, that's 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.

So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so yes, that's included. So, 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.

Let me check how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit can be 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for this block. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-400) and then 9 in the last block. So, 4*10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, in each full hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-409: does the tens digit here count as 4? Yes, because 400 is 4 in the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 0. Wait, no, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, so the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, actually, from 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 1-400? No, 440 is 440, which is less than 488, but 440 is within 401-488, right? So, perhaps I should consider up to 488. Let me correct that. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. So, the tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 8 is 8, 18 is 18, ..., 488 is 488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of eights is 98.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from four full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? 400 divided by 100 is 4, so 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last block is 400-499, but our book only goes up to 488, so does that affect the count? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488, but 450-499 would be beyond 488. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 4 blocks each contributing 10 fours, so 40 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 400-499 is the fifth block, but since our book ends at 488, 440-449 is still within 488, but 450-499 would be beyond. So, the tens place 4's are in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. So, I think I was wrong earlier; it's 50, not 40. Let me correct that. So, units place: 49 fours, tens place: 50 fours. Now, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers contributes a 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think: the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book stops at 488, so it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, starting from 4 up to 484. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full cycles, which would give 48 fours, but since 484 is the 49th occurrence, it's 49 fours. That seems correct. Tens place: every 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4*10=40, but wait, 400 is the end, so from 1-400, it's 40 fours in the tens place. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4 again in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. That makes sense. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that's 49+49=98 eights.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for fours. When I counted the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks each have 10 eights, and the last block has 9 eights, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When counting the units place for fours, I went up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. But when counting the units place for eights, I went up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, both units places have 49 counts. That makes sense.\n\nSo, the total fours are 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm overcounting? For example, in the number 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so it's counted once in units, once in tens, and once in hundreds. So, in my count, I correctly counted each occurrence, so that's fine.\n\nSimilarly, in 488, the digit 8 appears twice, so it's counted once in units and once in tens. So, in my count, I correctly counted each occurrence.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8 up to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   \n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, so this contributes 0.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, no, that might be double-counting. Let me think again. From 1-400, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's actually 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So, yes, 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, which is beyond 488, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four, and then 8 more numbers (481-488), where 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So total units fours: 48*1 +1=49. That's correct. Tens place: as above, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 eight, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, how many blocks? From 1-400, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens eights: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Okay, that seems like a lot, but let me check if I made a mistake. Wait, when counting units place, I thought it was 49, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for tens place, each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Then 440-449 is another 10, so 50. And hundreds place is 89. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, we check if 488 mod 10 is 8, which it is. So, the number of 8's in units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 =9 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 -98=90.

That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many hundreds are there? 400 is the 4th hundred. But wait, 400 is the start of the 4th hundred, so from 40-49 is the first block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th number because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, each block except the last one contributes 10 eights. So, 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in each of these, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " From 1-400, there are four such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 400-488, not 400-499. Let me adjust. From 1-399, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-409 as well, but the tens digit is 0 there. So, only 440-449 have tens digit 4. So, that's 10 more, making it 50. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, it is included. So, starting from 8, every 10th number up to 488. So, how many? From 0 to 488, the number of 8's in units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, so yes, it's included. So, floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1, so 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's four blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me double-check. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, tens place contributes 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the counts again. **Counting 4's:**\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block contributes 10, but wait, from 1-400, there are four blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, 440-449 is another 10. So total 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. So total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- Units place:8,18,28,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n- Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each block except the last contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: none, as before. So total 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights in total. So, the difference is indeed 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. Yeah, that makes sense. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10 eights. - 280-289: 10 eights. - 380-389: 10 eights. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, and the numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9 =49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409 and 440-449. Wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's 20. So, total in the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 20 (from 400-488) = 60 fours. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 400-488 includes 400-409 and 440-449, but 400-409 is part of the 400-499 range, which we've already counted in the 400s block. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider each hundred block separately. - 1-99: The tens place is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. - 100-199: Similarly, 140-149, another 10 fours. - 200-299: 240-249, another 10 fours. - 300-399: 340-349, another 10 fours. - 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 and 440-449. Wait, 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's 20 fours. So, adding up: 10 (1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 20 (400-488) = 60 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 60 + 89 = let's see, 49+60=109, 109+89=198. So, 198 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. - 1-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, another 10. - 200-299: 280-289, another 10. - 300-399: 380-389, another 10. - 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 198 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 100. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because 100 seems like a big difference. Let me go through the counts again.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49 (from 4,14,...,484)\n- Tens place: 60 (10 each in 1-99,100-199,200-299,300-399, and 20 in 400-488)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (400-488)\nTotal fours: 49 + 60 + 89 = 198\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49 (from 8,18,...,488)\n- Tens place: 49 (10 each in 1-99,100-199,200-299,300-399, and 9 in 480-488)\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, 198 - 98 = 100. Hmm, so the answer is 100 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the tens place for fours. In the tens place, for 400-488, I considered 400-409 and 440-449, which is 20 numbers. But 400-409 is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is another 10, so that's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 100. So, there are 100 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 10 occurrences each in the first four hundreds and 20 in the last hundred, totaling 60.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 60 + 89 = 198.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 10 each in the first four hundreds and 9 in the last, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 198 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 100.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{100}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. That's 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, that's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me confirm: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours here. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place 8? Let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check again: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 because it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counts. Let me recount the fours: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The last one is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, but since we start at 4, which is the first, so it's 48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the last, so (488-8)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four is 10, and the last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, yes, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes in these problems, especially when the upper limit isn't a multiple of 10, you have to adjust. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. So, yes, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:\n     - Number of occurrences: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is:\n     - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). The count is:\n     - First occurrence: 8\n     - Last occurrence: 488\n     - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers:\n     - Number of occurrences: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book's pages. The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each with 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, that's only 9, not 10, because 489 would be beyond 488. So, the tens place eights are 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if these are within 1-488. 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10 numbers. 280-289: yes, 10 numbers. 380-389: yes, 10 numbers. Now, 480-489 would have 488, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, does that count as a separate block? Let me see: The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488: the tens digit can be 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check again: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 49 is 98, but let me double-check the tens place count. Wait, in the tens place, I had 49 eights, but let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each part again. Counting 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, floor is 48, +1=49. So, 49 units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block of 100 has 10, and there are 5 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, but 440-449 is within that. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th term because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, 4's -8's=188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? Well, from 1-100: 40-49 is one block, 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. From 1-100: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block ending at 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred. Let me check again. From 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, each block contributes 10 except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 1 set \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Therefore, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89 \u2192 49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49 \u2192 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and units places, I might have missed something. Let me verify the tens place for 8's again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and one set of 9 (400-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, the total 4's are indeed 188, and 8's are 98. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, except the last block which contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, let's add up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many full blocks of 100 we have. From 1-400, we have four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.

The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. That's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, adding that, we have 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, adding that, we have 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units (49), tens (49), hundreds (0). 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in fours. When I considered the tens place for fours, I had 4 blocks of 100 (1-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 40+10=50. That seems correct. For eights in tens place, from 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then from 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That seems correct too. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, that's 0. So, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - From 1-400: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " So, from 1-400, how many such blocks are there? 4 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's actually 5 blocks because 400-499 would be the fifth, but our book goes only up to 488, so 440-449 is the last complete block. So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so does 480-489 count? Since 488 is the last page, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. Let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, how many such blocks? 4 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's an additional 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct. For the tens place of 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, you have to consider whether the upper limit is included or not. Let me check the units place for 4's. From 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term can be expressed as 10n - 6. Wait, let me think differently. The first term is 4, which is 4 + 10\u00d70, the second is 14=4+10\u00d71, and so on. The last term is 484=4+10\u00d7(n-1). So, 484=4 +10(n-1). Subtract 4: 480=10(n-1). Divide by 10: 48=n-1. So, n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488=8 +10\u00d7(n-1). So, 488-8=480=10(n-1). So, n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. Correct. For the tens place of 4's: Each block of 100 has 10 fours in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 440-449 is another 10, making it 50. Correct. For the tens place of 8's: From 1-400, 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 more, making it 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers. 8's: none. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of 4's = (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   Each block contributes 10 4's, and there are 5 such blocks.  \n   Number of 4's = 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of 4's = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of 8's = (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.  \n   Number of 8's = 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's = 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block. Each 100 numbers have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so from 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, no, that can't be right because 400-499 would have 10 fours in the tens place, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: (400-449) is 50 fours? Wait, no, let me correct. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's calculate (488 - 4)/10 +1 = (484)/10 +1 = 48.4 +1=49.4, which rounds to 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: For each hundred, 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (0-399) gives 40 fours, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 +50 +89= 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 488. Let's count each block. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive, which is 9 numbers). So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, so 8+1=9. So, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.

So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: - 40-49: 10 numbers. - 140-149: 10 numbers. - 240-249: 10 numbers. - 340-349: 10 numbers. - 440-449: 10 numbers.

Wait, but the book ends at 488, so does 440-449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours.

Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers are there? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49.

So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I thought 440-449 is included, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks each with 10 fours in the tens place, that's 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is 484, so (484-4)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49. Let me check the tens place again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, let me correct that. From 1-400, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total is 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place in 401-488 contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
