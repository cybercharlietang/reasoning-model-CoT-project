    "text": " Wait, but when counting units digits, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(488/10) = 48, and then check if there's a partial group. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, I think that's correct because 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, making it 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. Starting from 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book ends at 488, 449 is less than 488, so yes, all of 440-449 is included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. Let's see, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only interested in how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this range. Let's calculate how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total for the tens place: 4 full ranges of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus the last partial range from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has another block. Wait, but 400-488 only goes up to 488, so the 440-449 block is within that. So, how many blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. Then 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: Well, 480-489 would be another block, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, so in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there? The first three blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. Then, in 400-488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Alternatively, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 4's in units place is 48 full tens (1-480) plus one more in 484. So, 48 +1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the block 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 blocks are fully included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens (1-480), which gives 48 numbers, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 1-488. The blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Each contributes 10 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks, 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 exist? Well, the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. But in the tens place, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit from 480-488 is 8, but only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers). Wait, but when counting the tens place, I think I should consider how many times 8 appears in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each with 10, so 40. Now, in the hundreds place, 400-488: the tens digit here can be 0-8, but 8 is only in 480-488. Wait, but I'm considering the tens place separately. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place in the hundreds? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, in the hundreds, we have 9 more 8's. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49. Wait, but earlier I thought the blocks are 80-89, etc., up to 380-389, which are 4 blocks, each 10. Then, 480-488 is an additional 9. So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. When I considered 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so in the tens place, it's 9 more 8's. So, units:49, tens:40 (from the four blocks) +9=49, hundreds:0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought units was 49, tens was 49, so total 98. Now, let me double-check the units place: from 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1) =488. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, units place has 49 8's. Tens place: in 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484 => (n-1)*10=480 =>n-1=48 =>n=49. So, 49 in units. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. That's correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me confirm: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade (480-489), we have 484 as the 4th number in that decade. So, 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, actually, each full decade (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, the units place goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place as well. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is 10 pages. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 ranges, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place can also have a 4. Pages from 400 to 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade (480-489), we have 488 as the last number, so that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488, the next would be 480-489, but 480-489 is within 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 480-489 is within the 400-488 range, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have an 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with an 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 0 = 99.\n\nWait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-489, but 480-488 is within the book, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, does that mean in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers? Yes, because 480-488 all have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place, not 10. So, I think I made a mistake earlier by counting 10. So, let's correct that. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for that range. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total tens place eights: 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 5 ranges of 10 each, but that's incorrect because the last range only has 9 numbers. So, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place:0. So total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 50, but now I'm getting tens place as 49. So, let me recast this.\n\nLet me recalculate the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** As before, from 8,18,...,488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, the ranges are:\n   - 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights.\n   - 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 eights.\n   - 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 eights.\n   - 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 eights.\n   - 480-488: 9 numbers, 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, all with 8 in the tens place).\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** As before, 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place was 50, but now it's 49 because the last range only has 9 numbers. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this again. Let's take an example. From 1-100, how many 8's are there? Units place: 10 (8,18,...,98). Tens place: 10 (80-89). So total 20. So, in 1-100, 20 eights.\n\nSimilarly, from 101-200, same pattern: units place: 10, tens place:10, total 20.\n\nFrom 201-300: same, 20.\n\nFrom 301-400: same, 20.\n\nFrom 401-488: units place: 8 (408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488). Wait, 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, 408 is 408, which is 408, so that's within 401-488. Wait, but 408 is in 401-488? No, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so 408 is included. So, units place: from 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers (since 408 is the first, then every 10 up to 488). So, 9 eights in the units place.\n\nTens place in 401-488: the only range is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in 401-488: units place:9, tens place:9, total 18.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n1-100:20\n\n101-200:20\n\n201-300:20\n\n301-400:20\n\n401-488:18\n\nTotal 8's:20+20+20+20+18=98.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, total 8's:98.\n\nEarlier, I thought it was 99, but that was a mistake because the last range in the tens place only had 9 numbers, not 10. So, correct total is 98.\n\nNow, for the 4's, I had 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nSo, 188 fours, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I count all the 4's correctly?\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:188.\n\nAnd 8's:98.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. The ranges are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's, the tens place ranges are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in the tens place for 8's.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49, as calculated earlier.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, final answer: 188 fours -98 eights=90 more fours.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 fours. Hmm, I think that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (first 100 pages), 140-149 (next 100), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89 (first 100 pages), 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 488 is less than 489, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, right? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 4 ranges, 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, total eights: 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units: 49, tens: 40, hundreds: 0. Total: 89. 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the counts again. Units place for fours: from 4, 14, ..., 484. How many terms? The last term is 484. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place for fours is 49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, fours total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Eights: units place: 8, 18, ..., 488. Last term is 488. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, 4*10=40. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as 800-899 is beyond 488. So, eights total 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Therefore, there are 99 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 occurrences. There are 4 such ranges, totaling 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = **99**.\n\n$\\boxed{99}$"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll use the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. Let me check each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, maybe another way: for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 480-488. In that set, 484 is the 4 in the units place, which is within this range. So, 48 complete sets plus one more (484), making it 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. Let me confirm: from 1-10: 4 is the 4th number. 11-20: 14. 21-30:24. ... 481-490: 484. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 484 is the last one in the units place. So, how many? Let me think of it as for each ten, there's one 4 in the units. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), there's another 4 at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, that set is only up to 488. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there? From 1-488, there are four complete hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is the fifth set, but only up to 488. So, in each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 40-49: 10 times. Similarly, 140-149: 10 times, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10. 140-149:10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, totaling 50. But wait, the last set, 440-449, is within 400-488, so it's fully included. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, but let's check. The 8's in the units place occur at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? Let's see: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial set (481-488), there's 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's check each: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? In 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 such sets, contributing 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, the last page number ending with 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last page is 488, so 440-449 is okay, but what about 480-489? But since the book ends at 488, the 480-489 range would only go up to 488. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's think. Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) will have a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers in each except the last block, which might be cut off. Wait, in 400-488, the tens place goes from 0 to 8, so 400-409: tens digit 0, 410-419: 1, 420-429: 2, 430-439: 3, 440-449:4, 450-459:5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred block from 0-99 to 300-399 has a full 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and 400-488 also has 10 numbers. So, total 5 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Wait, but let me confirm: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check if I didn't double-count any numbers. Wait, no, because each digit position is considered separately. So, that should be correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which might be cut off. Let's see: From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4x10 +9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for 8's, the tens place: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4x10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place for both digits is 49. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is every 10 numbers, starting at 4 and ending at 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 484 / 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, actually, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 = 4 + 10*(48). So, 484 is the 49th number. So, units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but 480-488 is still within the book. Hmm, so let me clarify. Each time the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is correct, but does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, correct. 140-149: 10, correct. 240-249: 10, correct. 340-349: 10, correct. 440-449: 10, correct. So, 5*10=50. So, tens place: 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, hundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let's add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. Let's see: The last number is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, 488 is included. To find how many numbers, we can do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Each step is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each range:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: How many numbers? 488 - 480 +1=9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, let me add that: 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place: 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, correct. 180-189: 10, correct. 280-289:10, correct. 380-389:10, correct. 480-488: 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9). So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188 fours, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours there.\n\nWait, but for 8's, the hundreds place is 0 because the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 800. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: units place for 4's is 49, which includes 4,14,...,484. Since 484 is within 488, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place, 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so when counting units place for 8's, 488 is included, so yes, 49 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's than '8's printed in the book.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is the fifth block, right? So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each block normally has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-489) is cut off at 488, so it has 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, let me check that again. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page), so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + 1 if the digit is non-zero. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, for each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, totaling 48. But then, in the incomplete set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Okay, so units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many times this happens. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4. From 1-99: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 hundreds, but the last one only goes up to 488, so does 440-449 still fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit in 400-488 can still be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add them: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the incomplete set from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more 8. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189:10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total tens place eights: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the 4's and 8's in the units and tens places. For 4's: Units place:49, Tens place:50, Hundreds place:89. Total:49+50=99+89=188. For 8's: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. I said that from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0-8, so that's 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, which is correct. So, the count for 8's in the tens place is 49. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the digit is present in the units place of the total. Let me think again. For units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 pages, which is floor(488/10) = 48. But since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the units digit cycles 48 full times, each contributing a 4 once. But wait, in each cycle of 10, the units digit is 4 once. So, 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which ends with 8, so the units digit 4 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Wait, but from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see: The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, the units place has 49 fours. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was correct. Let me confirm: For units digit, the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, but since the last group ends at 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Wait, but when I count manually, I get 49. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me list some numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The first is 4, which is the 4th number, and the last is 484, which is the 484th number. How many numbers is that? The difference is 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a 40-49 range. So, for 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, but in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, but 488 is less than 450, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is in the 400s, but 488 is beyond 449, so all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, total tens digit 4's: 5*10=50. Wait, but let me check if the last range is fully included. 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 488 is beyond 449, so yes, all 10 are included. So, tens place: 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That's from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 488th page. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place:49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges are there in 1-488.\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n\nSo, 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Let me see:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, but actually, 480-488 is another range where the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place:49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place:0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 ranges:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four are full 10 numbers, the last is 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But does 488 count as a 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, because 488 is 4 8 8, so the hundreds digit is 4. So, yes, 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since 488 is less than 800, there are none. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, because the first page is 1, so starting from 4, which is page 4. So, 4,14,...,484. Let me calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, plus any extra. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th group, we have 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from all places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and the 49th group has 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights from all places: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 188 - 98 is 90? Wait, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts because that seems a bit high. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for fours. For fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: For the units place, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10.

So, total 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count? Yes, because 440 is within 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 8's. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488. The units digit here is 8, so that's one more 8. So, total 48+1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). But in the tens place, each of these ranges has 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers? 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 4's. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more 4's in the units place.  \n   Total in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 4's.  \n   Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, contributing 48 8's. The last number, 488, adds one more 8 in the units place.  \n   Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, and the range 480-488 contributes 9 8's.  \n   Total in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

From 0-488, the hundreds digits go from 0 to 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49). But wait, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears only up to 449, right? Because 450-488 would have tens digits 5-8, but the hundreds digit is 4. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. How many hundreds are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). So, 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 sets. But in each set, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? In 0-99, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Same for 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets. From 0-488, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, except maybe the last one. Let's check: 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 in the last set. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm: 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as for each ten numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which would be 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within 480-488. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. Let me confirm: pages 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me confirm. From 0-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 numbers. So, the tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. To find how many, we can take the last number, 488, subtract 8, divide by 10, then add 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. That would be numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers).\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 (10).\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 (10).\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 (10).\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the hundreds place for 400-488 only contributes 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 because 800 would be page 800, which is beyond 488. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units and tens again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of 8's is 49, which seems correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 and tens place had 49, so 98 in total. So, 8's:98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 0-484, every 10 numbers. So, 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and 5 such ranges, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place:8,18,...,488. 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I thought maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So, that's correct. Each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When counting the units place for 4's, I went up to 484, which is correct because 488 is the last page, and 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, the last number is 488, which is included, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my final answer is that there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 484 is included, but 485, 486, etc., don't affect the units place count beyond 484. So, maybe it's 49 times. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 full cycles would be up to 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the 481-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 481-488) = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers? Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so from 1-488, the units digit 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. How many times? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 2. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), which gives 48 eights in the units place, and then from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many ranges? From 1-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, that's 4 full ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. That adds up to 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. That adds up to 98. The difference is indeed 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. For 8's, the hundreds digit never appears, so that's correct. Let me check the tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. Correct. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct. Units place for both 4 and 8: 49 each. So, yes, the difference is 188-98=90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range being 480-488 (9 times), totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's minus number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48. But then, in the last partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4. Let me see: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89). So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding another 8 in the units place. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences except the last one, which contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range 480-488 contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. The difference would be 188 -98=90. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's. Maybe I overcounted.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nThe numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So that's correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo 4's total: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see: 488 is the last one. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four ranges each have 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo 8's total: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a number from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((N +1)/10) + (if the last digit is >=d, add 1). Wait, maybe that's more complicated, but let's try.\n\nAlternatively, for units place, the count is (N //10) + (1 if N %10 >=4 else 0) for digit 4. Similarly for 8.\n\nWait, but I think my initial method was correct. So, 4's: 188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way: For each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4: floor(488/10)=48 full decades, each contributing one 4, and since 488%10 >=4 (8 >=4), add 1 more. So 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor 8: floor(488/10)=48, and 488%10 >=8, so add 1. So 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4: floor(488/100)=4 full centuries, each contributing 10 times (40-49, etc.), but wait, actually, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place is calculated as:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N //10) %10\nlower = N %10\n\nIf current > d: count += (higher +1)*10\nIf current ==d: count += (higher)*10 + lower +1\nIf current <d: count += higher*10\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, for the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nEach time the tens digit is 4, which occurs in 40-49, 140-149, etc. So for 488, how many full groups of 100 are there? 4 (since 4*100=400). Each group contributes 10 occurrences. So 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial group (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8 in the tens place:\n\nEach full group of 100 contributes 10 occurrences (80-89, etc.), so 4*10=40. In the last partial group (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So total 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89)=188\n8's: units(49) + tens(49)=98\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, in the 49th cycle, we have 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in this last partial cycle, the units digit 4 appears only once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from 10 cycles) + 1 (from the partial cycle) = 49. Okay, that seems correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so yes, 10 numbers. So, tens place has 50 4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, right? Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book stops at 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify. 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see. The last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 have 8 in the units place? It's similar to the 4's. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the partial cycle, 480-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from full cycles) + 1 (from partial cycle) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, how many 8's? Let's see: 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 from 400-488. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5x10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, so 4x10 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This occurs every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. Each number contributes a 4, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This occurs every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last which has 9, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, let me think again. The numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 equals 48. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, that's an additional 1, making it 49. So, units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 540-549 isn't because 540 is beyond 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours\n- 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours\n- 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours\n- 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours\n- 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours (since 440-449 is within 488)\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add these up: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times 1 = 48. But wait, the 48th group ends at 480, and then 488 is the next one, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down:\n\n- 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights\n- 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights\n- 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights\n- 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights\n- 401-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 eights (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 eights and one block of 9 eights. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me make sure. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 occurrences in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, and then an extra 8 pages. In each group, the 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another occurrence. So, total in units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 blocks, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial group from 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including the partial block 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, let's think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, in the 48th group, which is 480-488, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So, that's the 48th occurrence. Wait, but starting from 1, the first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is the first group (1-10). So, each group of 10 contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups would have 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488, which is the 49th group? No, wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups (1-10, 11-20, ..., 480-489). But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48, because each group of 10 contributes one 4. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of times 8 appears in the units digit. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so does that mean 48 or 49? Let's see: the first 8 is at 8, then 18, ..., 488. So, how many? The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers contribute one 8. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 2, but wait, let's count properly. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, every 10 numbers, there's one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial decade (480-488), there's an 8 at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, from 480 to 488, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488 if we're considering the tens place. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's list them: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place in 400-488? The tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from the last block. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, total eights in tens place: 40 (from the first four blocks) + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 187, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 187. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for fours. Let me recount the units place for fours. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but now it's 49. So, units place for fours is 49, not 48. So, that changes things. So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Now, for eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, so the difference is 90. Wait, so I made a mistake earlier in the units place for fours. Let me confirm. The units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? Let's see: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place for fours is 49, not 48. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the correct difference is 90. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (second block), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 8 = 480, but since we include both endpoints, we add 1: 480 + 1 = 481. But wait, that's not right because we're counting every 10 numbers. Let me think differently. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus an extra 8 in the units place of 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The blocks are 80-89 (1), 180-189 (2), 280-289 (3), 380-389 (4). The next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have to check how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480-489 would be 10. So, for the 480-488 range, how many 8's in the tens place? Each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but wait, let me check again. The blocks are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the number of 4's. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, number of 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as 800-899 exceeds 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many complete sets of 100 we have. From 1 to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers? That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Now, how many complete hundreds do we have? Up to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. But wait, the last hundred is 301-400, and then 401-488. In 401-488, does the tens digit 8 appear? Yes, in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can only be 8 if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None (since the book ends at 488) \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th because it's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yeah, that makes sense. So, units place: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Well, the book goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. So, that's five blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because the book ends at 488, which is after 449. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times the hundreds digit is 4. Each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488)\n\nSo, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 1 block \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: from 80-89, that's 10 eights in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total fours: 188, total eights: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of fours, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Units place: 49 fours. Total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights, units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. So, total eights: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for eights again. The last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, the count is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the number of eights in the units place as floor(488/10) = 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, plus one more for the 488, making it 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last block which might be incomplete. So, from 0-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the last block is 400-488. In the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, total tens eights: 40 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of fours exceeds the number of eights by 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449?

So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the last page, so maybe it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the floor, then adding 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate for each digit place separately. Let me try again. For the units place, the number of 4's is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are, plus any extra. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48*10=480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences.

So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488. But in each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 10 occurrences. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 4th hundred? Wait, no, 400-499 would be the 4th hundred, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 4th hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs from 400-409, 440-449, and 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-409, 440-449, and 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 440-449, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is actually the tens digit 8, not 4. Wait, no, 480-489 would have the tens digit 8, right? So, in the 400-499 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks where the tens digit is 4. So, in each hundred, it's from x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. So, in 1-100, it's 40-49: 10 numbers. In 101-200, it's 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Now, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so yes, 50 occurrences. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 hundreds, but now it's 5 blocks? Wait, no, because from 1-400, there are 4 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similarly, for units digit 8, it appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, 488 is the next number, which is 488, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit 8, it appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each block contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 (from 480-488). So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, but 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to calculate the tens place for 8's: For each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total is 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10, so 4 hundreds give 40, but wait, no, in the 400-499 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 400-499 would be the 5th hundred? Wait, no, 1-100 is the first, 101-200 second, etc., so 400-499 is the 4th hundred. Wait, no, 1-100 is first, 101-200 second, 201-300 third, 301-400 fourth, and 401-500 fifth. So, in the fourth hundred (301-400), the tens digit 4 is in 340-349, which is 10 numbers. In the fifth hundred (401-500), the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. But since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is within range, so that's 10 numbers. So, total in tens place for 4's is 5 blocks: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nAnother way: For each digit place, the count is as follows:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 >= 4 + 10*floor(488/10) => Wait, maybe a formula would help. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit of N is >= d. Wait, no, more accurately, it's floor((N - d)/10) + 1. Wait, maybe I should use a more systematic approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate the number of times 4 appears.\n\nBut I think my initial counts are correct, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. Additionally, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks up to 440-449, giving 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit '4' appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** Similar to '4', '8' appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 occurrences. Total: 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, when counting from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems right. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many ranges? 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but I'm only considering the hundreds digit, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete group, there's one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial group, 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these ranges contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check. The range 480-488 is 9 numbers, so in the tens place, each of those has an 8. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, yes, that seems right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers) + 1 in the partial group (484) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 48 full groups + 1 in the partial group (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers.\n   - The last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times, plus one more for the 484? Wait, no, because 484 is within 488, so 484 is included. So, 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490) but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, from 1-480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this range, adding one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and possibly 480-489 if we had that many pages. Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set in the tens place would be 480-488. Let's see: Each time the tens digit is 4, it's a block of 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, but only the tens digit is 8, so 4 in the tens place doesn't appear here. Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, not 4. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 4's. Tens place: 50 4's. Hundreds place: 89 4's. Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's included. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place. Wait, no: from 1-488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last number is 488, which it is. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40, plus the last block 480-488 contributing 9 numbers. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems right. For 8's in the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. Wait, that's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Units place for 4's: 49. Tens:50. Hundreds:89. Total 188. Units for 8's:49. Tens:49. Hundreds:0. Total 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is page 484, which is within 488, so yes, it's included. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many full ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, the tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me count: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check each range. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3, or 4. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me verify the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Yes, because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. For the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, so 50. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full groups, but 484 is the 49th. So, 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place, 8,18,...,488: 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges gives 10, and the last gives 9, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last page is 488. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is before 488. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the 8's in the units place go up to 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 180-189 (10)\n- 200-299: 280-289 (10)\n- 300-399: 380-389 (10)\n- 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- 0-99: 10\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, that's 49. But wait, let me double-check. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let me recount. From 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50. From 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50.

Correct.\n\n- Tens place:49. As above, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place:0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Alternatively, maybe I should calculate it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (4,14,24,...,84,94). So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, total units place 4's would be 40 + 9 = 49. Okay, so units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds:89. Total 188. Now, let me check the 8's. I'll do the same approach: count the number of 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but the last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? Let me think: for each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Each hundred contributes 10 units place 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, how many units place 8's? 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So total units place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just cross-verify the counts again to make sure I didn't overcount or undercount. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 \u00d7 10 = 480, but since each decade has one 4 in the units place, it's 48 occurrences.  \n   - In the remaining 88 pages (481-488), 484 is the only additional 4 in the units place.  \n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - There are 48 full decades contributing 48 occurrences, plus 488 adds one more.  \n   - Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Each full range (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 occurrences, and 480-488 contributes 9.  \n   - Total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).  \n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, no, because page numbers start at 1, so the first 4 is at 4, which is the 4th page. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let's see: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 40-49, that's 1. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, for the tens place, we have 4 full ranges of 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range of 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. I think I did everything correctly. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each full range contributes 10 numbers, with the last range contributing 9. Total: 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? The book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, we have 4 blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, the first block is 0-99, but in the context of page numbers, it's 1-99. But for counting digits, we can consider it as 0-99, 100-199, etc., and adjust if necessary. So, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but similar to the 4's, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488) So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0-4. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers start with 8).\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so does 0 count? No, because the first page is 1, so the first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is the first occurrence. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, total cycles = 488 // 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial cycle, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's one more 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Okay, so units place: 49 fours.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, and then 480-488. But in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since the book has 488 pages, 440-449 is okay because 449 < 488. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nTotal number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.

    "text": " Wait, but the first page is 1, so does page 4 count as the first? Yes, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but each cycle has one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included, but the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is within 488. So, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and since 488 is the last page, 449 is within the book. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9 =40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90.

So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 (1), 140-149 (2), 240-249 (3), 340-349 (4), 440-449 (5). So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 ranges are within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, that's 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49 times. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488. 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. 480-489 would be next, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the book. Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 is a range where the tens digit is 8. But since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) have 10 numbers each, contributing 10 eights in the tens place each. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, when does the hundreds digit equal 8? Well, 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.

    "text": " Wait, no, wait. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the 480-489 range, 484 is included, so that's the 48th group, which would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which still includes 484. So, maybe it's 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated by considering the higher digits and the lower digits. Let me try using a formula. For the units place: The number of 4's is equal to the number of complete tens. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, in the units place, each 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, 48 times. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, how many ranges is that? From 0-99: 1 range, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-449, which is another range, and 450-488 doesn't have a tens digit of 4. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total ranges: 5 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, so that's another 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, meaning 48 eights. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers. Because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299:280-289, 10. From 300-399:380-389,10. From 400-488:480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each, and 1 range with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48? Wait, earlier I thought 488/10=48.8, so 48 times. But when I listed 4,14,...,484, that's 49 numbers. Hmm, which is correct? Let me see: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the floor of 488/10) +1 if the remainder is >=4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since the remainder is 8, which is greater than 4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48 +1 = 49. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's also 49. So, correcting that:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: Let's recalculate. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut off. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many such ranges? From 0-99:1, 100-199:1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1 (since 440-449 is within 400-488). So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, tens place:50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 48+50+89=187, but now it's 49+50+89=188. So, I think I made a mistake in the units place earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place: Let's see, 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 ranges. The first four have 10 numbers each, the last one has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187-98=89, but now it's 188-98=90. Hmm, which is correct? Let me check again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? Let's see, the first is 4, the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49.\n\nTens place: Each range of 100 has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. From 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 ranges. The first four have 10 numbers each, the last one has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers or miss any ranges.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[ 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 numbers each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[ 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\]\n\n**Difference:**\n\\[ 188 - 98 = 90 \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "is_correct": true,
    "num_tokens": 3588,
    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " Wait, that might be incorrect. Let me think again. If I consider numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra numbers. In each complete decade, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? 484 is within this range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, counting the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges:\n   - 40-49: 10 numbers\n   - 140-149: 10 numbers\n   - 240-249: 10 numbers\n   - 340-349: 10 numbers\n   - 440-449: 10 numbers\n   But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, we're only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4. So, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 numbers. But wait, we're counting how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the incomplete decade (481-488), 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9. So, how many blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 +49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4's and 8's: 49 each. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (including 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each block (80-89, 180-189, etc.), except the last block which has 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
