    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only interested in the hundreds digit, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and one block of 9 (from 400-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199:180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, step 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers. How many blocks? From 0-99:40-49 (10). 100-199:140-149 (10). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488:440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. How many numbers? 488-400 +1=89. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but let's check the last one: 488 is included, so 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 0 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, it's included. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full steps, plus the last one. So, 48 +1=49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 0 to 484, stepping by 10).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 0 to 488, stepping by 10).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- **Difference:** 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. How many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). Wait, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds places with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights: 98. Now, fours were 188. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of these, the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, so 40+10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-499, but since the book ends at 488, it's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So yes, 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4*10=40 + 9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights in total. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the number of 4's. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total 49+50+89=188 fours. That seems correct. Now, for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, I think I missed the 480-489 block earlier. Wait, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188 fours - 98 eights=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. But wait, I'm getting 90, but I think the correct answer might be different. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the number of 8's in the tens place. Let me list them: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place:49. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in different places, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach. For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Units place: For 4, every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full tens, plus if the last number is >=4, which it is (488), so 48+1=49 fours. Similarly for 8: 488//10=48 full tens, and last number is 488, which ends with 8, so 48+1=49 eights. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Tens place: For 4, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. How many hundreds? 488//100=4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 401-488. In each full hundred, 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. For 8, tens digit: each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 4 full hundreds:4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Hundreds place: For 4, numbers from 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For 8, hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 eights. So, total fours:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188. Total eights:49(units)+49(tens)+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 5 blocks contributing 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks and a partial block (480-488), totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49, that's one block. Then each hundred has another block. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, the last block is 440-449. Since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place: 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 is one block, 180-189 another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. But wait, does 380-389 fit within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 eights. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours to find how many more fours there are: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99.

    "text": " Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The formula for counting how many times a digit appears in a specific place is: For units place, it's floor(n/10) + 1 if the digit is in the units place. But actually, for numbers from 1 to n, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor(n/10) + (1 if d <= n%10 else 0). Hmm, maybe I should use a more systematic approach. Let's consider each position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For each complete set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 fours. Now, after 480, the next set is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, we check from 481 to 488. In this range, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are up to 488.\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Similar to 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 eights in the units place from the complete blocks.\n\nNow, check the last partial block: 481-488. The units digits here go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights in the tens place because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many eights in the tens place?\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nTotal tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last block contributes 9 eights, so total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place:\n\n- The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. When counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's correct, so 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but when I added units and tens, I got 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, let me compare that to the fours, which were 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because that seems like a big difference. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the fours or the eights.\n\nLet me recount the fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights: 98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for counting digits. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a method where we consider each digit position separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if 4 <= 488 mod 10, which is 8, so 4 <= 8, so add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus if 8 <= 8, which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4, which represents the number of complete hundreds. Then, the remainder is 88. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred block where the tens digit is 4. So, how many times does the tens digit equal 4 in 1-488?\n\nThe hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, for hundreds 0-4 (i.e., 0-400), that's 5 hundreds. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: floor(488 / 100) = 4. So, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. For each hundred, the tens digit is 8 exactly 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50, but wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred (400-488) only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 hundreds * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier count of 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place: floor(488 / 1000) = 0, but since 488 is less than 1000, we look at the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: since 488 < 800, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake, but now it seems consistent. Let me try another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: as before, 49.\n- Tens place: 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89.\nTotal: 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n- Tens place: 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, I can do 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The sequence is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 480-489 would be in the 400s, but our book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is part of this. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the tens place in the hundreds digit 4 contributes only 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: from 0-399, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributing 10 per range. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributing 10 per range. From 0-399, there are 4 ranges, and from 400-488, there are 9 numbers (480-488). Total tens place 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, but since we're only going up to 488, 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8, but for 4 in the tens place, it's up to 449. Let's count how many sets of ten have 4 in the tens place. Each set contributes 10 numbers. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these sets contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is a partial block. So, for the tens place: - 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. - 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. - 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. - 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. - 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that count? Yes, because 488 is page 488, so 8 in the units place is present. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. - 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place here. So total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more fours than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct. For eights, in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98 eights. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From page 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct. So, the total fours are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.

Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449, because 450-459 would still be within 488, but 460-469, etc., up to 488. Wait, no, 440-449 is the last full set before 488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. The first set is 40-49: that's 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 488 include any more fours in the tens place beyond 449? Let me check: 450-459: tens digit is 5, so no. 460-469: tens digit 6, no. 470-479: tens digit 7, no. 480-488: tens digit 8, no. So, the last full set is 440-449, so 5 sets, 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Let's count how many full sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers. The first set is 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets are full, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Therefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? The first block is 1-100, then 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500. But our book ends at 488, so the last block is 401-488. Let's calculate how many full hundreds we have: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. That's four full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. How many numbers are here? 488-400=88, so 88 numbers. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, the tens place contributes 40 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks? 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. The last block is 401-488. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens place contributes 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89 is within 488, so that's one. 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 are also within 488. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, does 480-488 count as a range where the tens digit is 8? Yes, because the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check that. 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (3rd digit from the right):** 4 appears from 400 to 488. This range includes 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) with 10 each, and 480-488 contributing 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, which is also 10 numbers. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, how many total? 1 (for 40-49) + 1 (140-149) + 1 (240-249) + 1 (340-349) + 1 (440-449) = 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only when the page number is between 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But wait, 8 occurs in 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? The first is 8 (which is 0*10 + 8), then 18 (1*10 +8), up to 488 (48*10 +8). So, that's 49 numbers, right? Because 0 to 48 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488), not 10. So, let me count each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only when the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But let's check: from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many blocks there are. The first block is 80-89, which is within 1-99. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers (480-488). Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: (4 blocks * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but wait, the page numbers go up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488. Therefore, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10).

So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's.

Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block. Let's check: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are there from 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks and 9 times in the last block.

So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10 numbers). 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers). 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). 401-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place fours: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). Wait, so the last block has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, let's calculate: 4 blocks of 10 (400 numbers) and then 9 in the last partial block. So, total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are up to 488. - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers. Now, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but for the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but when considering the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens place counts are: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 is another (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 is another (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the range. Since the book has 488 pages, 480-488 is included. So, how many blocks? From 1-99: 80-89 is one block (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 is another block, but it's only 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: Does 480-489 fall within 400-488? 480-489 is within 400-488 only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, it's 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 0-399, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. So, 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, we have 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers).

So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through each digit position as well: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each range. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place has 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges with 10 each (4*10=40) plus 9, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's count these: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, 449 is within the range, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers add one more. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: since 488 is the end, this set has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, for the tens place, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book only goes up to 488, 449 is within the range, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find the count, I can divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but I think I need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count how many ranges there are. 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 eights, and the last contributes 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, which would have 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers). So that's 4 blocks with 10 eights each, and one block with 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct. For the tens place of 4's, we had 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, 188-98=90.

How many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks with 10 and 1 block with 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So units place is 49 fours, correct. Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Now, 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 380-389. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but 488 is the last page. So 480-488: 9 numbers. So, does 480-488 count as a partial block? Yes. So, in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so each of these 9 numbers contributes an 8 in the tens place. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that seems conflicting with my initial thought. Let me clarify: Each full block of 100 has one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So up to 488, how many such blocks? 400-488 is the last set. So, in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 eights each, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. That makes sense. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 eights. Wait, that's 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, but wait, earlier I thought 440-449 is the fifth block, but in 488, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So 49+50+89=188 fours. For the 8's: Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. Wait, earlier I thought 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the first four are full blocks of 10, and the last is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 4's. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks *10=50 fours. Correct. And the hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book has 488 pages, 480-488 is part of the book, but 489 is beyond. So, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 488, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place as part of numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is beyond 488? No, 440-449 is up to 449, which is less than 488. So, let's see: Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 5 sets are within the range. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. Now, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as part of numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's break it down: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are four blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the fifth block. So, each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me calculate: From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. 401-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so does the last block go up to 488? Yes, but since 440-449 is within 401-488, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many fours are there? Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. 201-300: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. 301-400: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. 401-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, in 401-488, the tens place 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (401-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 fours, except the last one, which is 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so it's a full 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges \u00d710 =50 fours. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, the last page is 488, so the last occurrence is 488. To count how many, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4\u00d710=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place (480-488). So, does that add another 9? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the hundreds place 4, but the tens place 8 would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, I think I missed that. So, the tens place 8's are in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. The first four are full 10 numbers, and the last one is 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49. Let me check again. From 0-99: 80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from page 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. When counting fours in the tens place, I considered 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours. That seems correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, with the last one having 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both fours and eights: 49 each, which makes sense because from 1 to 488, each digit from 0-9 appears roughly the same number of times in the units place, except maybe the last digit. But since 488 ends with 8, the units digit 8 appears one more time than 4, but wait, in our count, both units digits had 49. Wait, let me check units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, with common difference 10, up to 484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 =484. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484 =>10(n-1)=480 =>n-1=48 =>n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488 => (n-1)*10=480 =>n-1=48 =>n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. So that's correct. Tens place for fours: 50, as above. Tens place for eights:49. So, total fours=188, eights=98. Difference=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total blocks are 5, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many numbers there are, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's actually 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). - 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). - 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 489 is beyond 488). So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So, total eights in the tens place are 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many such sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers. The first set is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets in total, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 sets * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me do the same approach for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many sets? The first three sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) are complete, each with 10 numbers. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. But wait, the last set would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total eights in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that seems off. Let me think again. Each complete set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-489 would be 5 sets. But since 480-489 is only up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 4 complete sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 eights, and one incomplete set (480-488) with 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

That's 5 sets, but the last set (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, for the first four sets, each contributes 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 1-488, we have four blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But the 400-488 block is only partial. So, for the tens place: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488. So, let's see: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), and so on. The last block before 488 would be 440-449. How many blocks are there? From 40-49 up to 440-449, that's 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 blocks give 50 fours. Wait, but 488 is beyond 449, so does that affect the count? No, because the tens digit is 4 only up to 449. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499. But since the book ends at 488, it's 400-488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last). So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. That's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's a total of 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, but since 488 is included, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? But since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's an additional 9 eights. So, total in tens place is 40 (from the four full ranges) + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, each 10, so 40, but now I'm adding 9 more from 480-488. So, total is 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers, so from 1-100, 10-19 have 4 in the tens place, but wait, actually, in the tens place, it's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and then the next would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488. So, in the tens place, the 4's occur in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So that's 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block with 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9 =49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98 eights. Wait, that seems correct. So, total fours:188, total eights:98.

Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. From 0-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, in the hundreds place, we have 4 ranges with 10 numbers each, and one range with 9 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me verify the fours again: units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For the eights: units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me check again. The tens place eights: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and one with 9. 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and since 440-449 is within 400-488, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This results in 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - This results in 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Yes, because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. So, that's 4 blocks. Each block has 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0, total 89. Difference: 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
