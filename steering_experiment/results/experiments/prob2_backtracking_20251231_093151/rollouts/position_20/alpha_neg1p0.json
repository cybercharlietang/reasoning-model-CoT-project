How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488. So, how many ranges do we have? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all five ranges are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, starting from 8, the first number is 8, then 18, ..., 488. So, how many numbers? From 0 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >= 8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So, floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1, so 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in the 40-49 range, every number has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count these blocks: - 40-49: 10 fours - 140-149: 10 fours - 240-249: 10 fours - 340-349: 10 fours - 440-449: 10 fours Now, since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, every 10 numbers adds one more 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks: - 80-89: 10 eights - 180-189: 10 eights - 280-289: 10 eights - 380-389: 10 eights - 480-488: how many? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-499, there are 50-60, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range would be 440-449, because 450-488 would not include another 4 in the tens place. So, let's see: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 49 numbers if we take the integer part. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the first range is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Wait, 480-489 would be the next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49? Let me add again: 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. Yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let me count how many such groups there are. The first group is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many groups is that? Let's see: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the tens place 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 groups, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so that's okay. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be next, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many such groups are there? Let's see: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the tens place 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four groups are complete (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. The last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds place never has an 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, let me check again. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, did I make any mistakes here? Let me go through each step again. For the fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 groups, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 49+50+89=188. For the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 4 full groups (each 10) and one partial group (9 numbers). So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in groups like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in groups like 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n   - There are 4 full groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial group (480-488 with 9 numbers).\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking at the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449: 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89. So, 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences. Wait, 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of the range. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 eights in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 eights (480-488 inclusive). So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 fours). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 fours). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 fours). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 fours). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 fours). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But let's check: starting at 8, the last occurrence is 488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers (since 488 is 488 = 8 + 10*(48), so 49 numbers). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 eights). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights). From 400-488: 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens place is 8 only for 480-489, but since we go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier, for the hundreds place, we had 400-488, but for the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many ranges have 10 eights? From 0-399, we have four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights. So, that's 4*10=40 eights. Then, in 400-488, the tens place is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through the counts again. For fours: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For eights: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total eights: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me check the tens place again. For eights in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens:49, total 98. Fours: 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 50 + Hundreds: 89 = 188 fours.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights.\n   - In the range 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n- Units: 49 + Tens: 49 = 98 eights.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's (188) - Number of 8's (98) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Since the book goes up to 488, the highest set where the tens digit is 4 is 440-449. So, that's 440-449, which is another 10. So, how many sets? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units place. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me count how many sets. 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's see how many such blocks there are. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. But wait, 0 in the hundreds place would mean it's a two-digit number, so 40-49 is the first block. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 count? The book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So yes, that's valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 numbers. Let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 8,18,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3. So, 80-89 (hundreds digit 0), 180-189 (hundreds digit 1), 280-289 (hundreds digit 2), 380-389 (hundreds digit 3). That's 4 blocks, each with 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. However, when considering the tens place, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, I think I missed that. Let me correct that. The tens place 8 can also appear in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total eights in the tens place are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40. So, I need to adjust. So, the correct count is 49 eights in the tens place. Let me verify: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place had 49, so total eights would be 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. But let me double-check the tens place because I might have made a mistake. When counting the tens place, the 8's appear in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) has 9 eights because 488 is the last page. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the fours or eights. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each of these blocks has 10 fours in the tens place. Now, let's see how many complete blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours. Now, I should check if the last block (440-449) is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, it's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units? It's every 10 numbers, so floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 has a 48 in the units, 488/10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 48*10=480, so from 4 to 484, that's 49 numbers (since 484 is the 49th). So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: As above, 5 blocks of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8. So, the count is floor(488/10) = 48.8, so 48 full decades, but wait, 48*10=480, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. For the tens place, the blocks are: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), with the last block being 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488/10=48.8, so the last 8 in units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 would be another block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-488 part is included. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, so I missed that. So, the tens place in the 400s: 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 4 blocks *10 + 9=49 eights. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, in the tens place, we have: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, total 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many full blocks there are: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the first four blocks each have 10 eights, and the last block has 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 +9 =40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place that have an 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 +0=98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours -98 eights =90.

How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 fours). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 fours). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 (10 fours). 300-399: 340-349 (10 fours). 400-488: 440-449 (10 fours). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours. So, each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-400, but since we go up to 488, it's still 5 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 fours = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine.

How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which would give 48 eights, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 eights). 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights). 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights). 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights). 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens place 8 occurs only 9 times, not 10. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 eights, but the last block only has 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49? Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. From 0-399, each hundred has a full block of 10 eights in the tens place. So, 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). That's 4\u00d710=40. Now, 400-488: The tens place 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But the last block is only up to 488, so the tens place in 400-488 would go up to 480-488, which still has 10 fours in the tens place (480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, the tens place for 4's occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.

Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's check: 488 is the 49th term because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488 => 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (80-89, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 blocks. The first four blocks have 10 eights each in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. The last block is 480-488, which has 9 eights in the tens place (480-488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710 =40, plus 9 from the last block, totaling 49 eights. Wait, but let me double-check: 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Now, let's see how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, which has 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 fours. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10 fours. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10 fours. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 fours. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but I should check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total of 188 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, we have 49 numbers where 8 appears in the units place. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. From 1-99: 80-89, which is one block, 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10 eights. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so that's 9 eights in the tens place, not 10. So, let me adjust. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 1-399) and one partial block from 400-488. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total of 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Number of 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Number of 8's: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 (for 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the hundreds place contain 8.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set, giving 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. So, units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers.  \n   - From 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 + 1}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each range contributes 10 fours.  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers.  \n   - From 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 + 1}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - The last range (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each have 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include page 488? Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, those are valid. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. To find the count, subtract 400 from 488 and add 1: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, that's 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 1 block of 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Each of these blocks has 10 fours in the tens place. Now, let's see how many complete blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488 pages? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Let's see how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, does 488 count as an additional occurrence? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. How many numbers is that? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let me calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to check if 480-488 is included. So, the blocks are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so only 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges in total. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 fours each = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Yes, that's 49 numbers because 488 is included. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10 eights. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many eights are there here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens place in 400-488 contributes 9 eights. Adding up: 4 ranges with 10 eights each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) gives 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's check each range: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). - 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). - 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part gives 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, only 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 gives 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four ranges each have 10, and the last has 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but I should check if 440-449 is fully within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times this happens. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 after 8. So, from 8 to 488 in steps of 10, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place.

Now, from 400-488, the next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, we have 9. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges with 10 each (4\u00d710=40) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds place eights. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98.

Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. The last block would be 440-449. How many blocks are there? Let's see: from 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), 440-449 (5th). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488. So, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (1st), 180-189 (2nd), 280-289 (3rd), 380-389 (4th). Wait, but does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49 + 40 = 89. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that's correct.

Let me see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is in the first hundred. Then 140-149 in the second hundred, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, there are 5 hundreds. But in each hundred, the 40-49 block contributes 10 fours. So, 5 hundreds would give 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but the last hundred is 400-488. Does that include 440-449? Yes, so 440-449 is the 400-488 hundred's 40-49 block.

Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48.8, so 48 full tens, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence.

From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189 is another. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: 480-488. That's 5 blocks. But wait, the last block is only up to 488, so does that affect the count? In 480-488, how many eights in the tens place? The numbers are 480, 481, ..., 488. The tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, that's only 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place. The last block, 480-488, has 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. That would be the number of 4's minus the number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n2. **Tens Place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units Place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n2. **Tens Place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This is 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds Place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The book goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449. That's 5 ranges in total (40-49 is the first, then each hundred has another). Each contributes 10 fours, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 count as a full range? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89 (first range), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8. So, that's another range, right? Wait, 480-489 would be the fifth range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place for 8 in 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 eights, and then 480-488, which is 9 eights (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights. Wait, but I'm not sure if 480-488 is considered a separate range or part of the hundreds place. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens place has 4 full ranges (each 10) and 1 partial range with 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for eights, I considered 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710=40, +9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. And units place for fours: 4,14,...,484, which is 49 numbers. And hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so total 98. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens place 4 occurs in the following ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 fours, so 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book only has 488 pages, 449 is within the range. So, yes, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have a 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, let me add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 has 9 eights, not 10. So, I need to adjust that. So, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So total eights in tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 ranges, but now it's 5 ranges, with the last one being partial. So, units place had 49, tens place now is 49 as well. Wait, no, let me recount. 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can have an 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place, making the tens place total 49. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me go through the units place again for fours: from 4, 14, ..., 484. How many? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (484)/10 = 48.4, floor is 48, +1 = 49. Correct. For tens place: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. Wait, earlier I thought 440-449 is within 488, which it is. So, 50 fours in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct. Now for eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but I thought earlier that in the tens place for eights, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 include numbers beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 would be part of this set. So, let's count the sets. Each set has 10 numbers. The first set is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-489. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, for the tens place, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights in the tens place. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 fours, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades. But 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. How many terms? Let's see, the sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term can be represented as 8 + (n-1)*10. We want the nth term \u2264 488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Subtract 8: (n-1)*10 \u2264 480. Divide by 10: n-1 \u2264 48. So, n \u2264 49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges. 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 eights (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Let me think: 480 has 8 in tens place, 481 has 8, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers. So, for the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 to 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range ending at 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many complete hundreds we have. From 1-488, we have four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but it's not complete. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred block, the tens place is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-400, there are four complete hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40 fours. Now, from 400-488, the tens place is 4 for 40-49, but in the 400-488 range, the tens place starts at 0 (400) and goes up. Wait, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens place being 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that adds 10 more fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Yes, because 488 is the 49th occurrence (8, 18, ..., 488). So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each complete hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-400, there are four complete hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, from 401-488, the tens place is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that's 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights, we subtract: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 440-449, because 450-488 doesn't include another 4 in the tens place. Let me count these blocks. Each block has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 fours. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, the 49th occurrence is at 484, so units place has 49 fours. Tens place: as above, 5 blocks each with 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is 480-488. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so only 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) \u2192 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488 \u2192 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me just make sure I didn't double-count or miss any. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (since 484 is the 49th number in this sequence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 eights.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 eights**.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 1-100, where 40-49 have 10 fours. Then 101-200, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 201-300: 240-249: 10. 301-400: 340-349: 10. Now, 401-488: 440-449: 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds place starts at 100. So, from 400-488, it's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, in the units place, I thought 484 is the last one, which is 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49. Tens place: Each hundred block has 10, and there are 5 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500). But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which has only 9. Let's see how many blocks: 1-100: 80-89: 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289: 10. 301-400: 380-389: 10. 401-488: 480-488: 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks with 10 eights each, and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits with 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought units and tens each have 49, so 49+49=98. But let me check the tens place again. For the tens place, in each hundred block, 80-89, etc., except the last block which is only up to 488, so 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4 blocks with 10, and 1 block with 9, totaling 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 more fours than eights seems high. Let me go through each digit place again for both fours and eights to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many? The last number is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 / 10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. There are 5 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500), but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 401-488, which still includes 440-449, so that's 5 blocks with 10 each. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 eights, and the last block has 9 eights (480-488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: No eights because the book ends at 488, so no page numbers in 800s. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

Let's count how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book only goes up to 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place, but only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, let me clarify: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 eights (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and an additional 9 eights from 480-488. So, that's 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. 180-189: 10 eights. 280-289: 10 eights. 380-389: 10 eights. 480-488: 9 eights. So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, ..., 400-488). So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, tens place has 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place has 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges \u00d710 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49. Wait, but let me count again: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. How many terms? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check each range: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, for the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488.  \n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last range is limited to 480-488.  \n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No 8's since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each hundred block except the last one, there's a full block of 10 fours. That's 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40 fours. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens place is 4 for 400-409, but wait, no, 400-409 is actually 400-409, but 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range. Wait, actually, the tens place is 4 in 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, that's another 10 fours. So total tens place fours are 4*10 + 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's another 10. So total tens place fours are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8, 18, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 eights), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10). So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights. Now, in the 400-488 range, does the tens place have any 8's? Let's see: 480-489 would be the next, but our book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is part of this. The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place eights are 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, let's see how many such ranges there are up to 488. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: 10 numbers. From 240-249: 10 numbers. From 340-349: 10 numbers. From 440-449: 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition again: 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, starting from 8, each step is +10. The count would be (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count them: From 80-89: 10 numbers. From 180-189: 10 numbers. From 280-289: 10 numbers. From 380-389: 10 numbers. From 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights from each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me make sure. Wait, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, fours: units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, units:49 fours. Tens place: 40-49:10,140-149:10,240-249:10,340-349:10,440-449:10. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. How many? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, difference is 188-98=90.

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. If I divide 488 by 10, that's 48.8, which would suggest 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as one of the units place 8's? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 would be part of this range. But 480-489 is a full range of 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the 489th page doesn't exist. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is present for 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, 480-488 gives 9 eights, not 10. So, the ranges are: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But the hundreds digit in page numbers from 1-488 can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.  \n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.  \n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 101-200: 140-149 (10). From 201-300: 240-249 (10). From 301-400: 340-349 (10). From 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Wait, no. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, the number of fours in the hundreds place is 89. But wait, let me confirm: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours printed: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one which has 9. So, how many blocks? From 1-100: 80-89 (10). From 101-200: 180-189 (10). From 201-300: 280-289 (10). From 301-400: 380-389 (10). From 401-488: 480-488 (9). So, total eights in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, we have 5 blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But the tens place 4 occurs in the 40-49 range in each block. So, in each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there's one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block has 10 eights in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 0-99: 80-89 (10 eights). 100-199: 180-189 (10 eights). 200-299: 280-289 (10 eights). 300-399: 380-389 (10 eights). 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed.

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the digit 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total of 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total of 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit in 400-488 can also have 4 in the tens place, which is 440-449.

So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, tens place contributes 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of fours is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 is the 49th number because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit. The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the block 480-488 contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of eights is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo find this, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, resulting in 89 occurrences.\n   \n   Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). This results in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 occurrences). This results in 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8, so no occurrences.\n\n   Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"
