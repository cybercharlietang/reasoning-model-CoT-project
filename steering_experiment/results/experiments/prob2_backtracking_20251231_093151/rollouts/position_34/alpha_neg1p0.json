    "text": " Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. Let me calculate how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8, 18, ..., 488. So, 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. So, each set of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me double-check: units 49, tens 49, so total 98. That seems correct. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188. That seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences (since 8 is the first and 488 is the last in the units place). So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is the last set. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three sets (180-189, etc.) is 10, and the last set 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98, correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just cross-verify the counts again to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. Difference is 90.

Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.

So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, 98 eights in total.

So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488.

For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the units place for fours. Let me check again. Units place for fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484. 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, yes, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488. So, 8 + (n-1)*10=488. 10(n-1)=480, so n=49. So, that's correct. Now, tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Tens place for eights: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Hundreds place for eights: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. Therefore, 188-98=90.

So, 10*4=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.

So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, each of the first four sets has 10, and the last set has 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. I thought that from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so in the tens place, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 480-488: 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the hundreds place, from 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nWait, but when I was counting fours in the tens place, I included 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 numbers, making 50 in the tens place.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, wait, when I did the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me verify that again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers: 14,24,...,484. To find how many, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: as above, 50. Hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many? Let's calculate: The first is 8, then every 10 numbers up to 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Wait, 488 ends with 8, so that's the last one. How many such numbers? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Each step is 10, starting at 8. The number of terms can be calculated by ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, the book goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be the next set, but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since 489 isn't in the book, we only go up to 488. So, how many numbers in 480-488 where the tens digit is 8? Let's see: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of these sets has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 because 489 is beyond 488. So, the number of eights in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. That's 4*10 + 9 = 49.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.

Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 380-389 is within 488. Yes, 389 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. Total 89. 188 - 89 = 99. Hmm, that's correct. But wait, did I make a mistake in counting the tens place for fours? Let me check again. For tens place fours: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. Let's see: 484 is the last one. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place is 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th occurrence, so 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, so 4*10=40. So, 49+40=89 eights. So, 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 99. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any numbers. For example, in the units place, the first 4 is at 4, and the last is at 484. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? It's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, etc., up to 440-449:10. So, 5 sets, 50 fours. And hundreds place: 400-488:89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389: 4 sets, 40 eights. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+40=89 eights. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Hmm, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there are 10 fours in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each of the first four hundreds has 10 fours in the units place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the units digit cycles from 0-8, so the fours in the units place are 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, total units fours: 40 + 9 = 49. That matches my earlier count. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last one is 488, which is the units digit. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers up to 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10: 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these sets contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9 eights (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights:0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make an off-by-one error or miscount.\n\nFor the fours:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor the eights:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

So starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

So, how many such numbers are there? Let me see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. To find how many terms, I can calculate (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set before that has 10 numbers, but the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). Let me count how many sets: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes in the counting. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

Let me count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (except the last one) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

    "text": " Let me recount each position. Units: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 6? Wait, no. Wait, 4 is the first term, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 fours. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds? From 0 to 400, that's 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, but the tens digit 4 is only in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but only up to 488. So, how many full tens blocks are there with tens digit 4? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but also in 400-409, the tens digit is 0, so that's not 4. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, 450-459, etc., but actually, no, the tens digit is 4 only when the second digit is 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, in each hundred, it's 10 numbers. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 fours in the tens place. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total fours: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. The last one is 488. So, how many? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, it's the second digit. So, for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's count how many full hundreds have this. From 0-99:80-89:10 numbers. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89 eights.**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 89 eights = **99 more fours than eights.**\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{99}."

    "text": " Let me recount. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So that's correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 +50 +89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last number with 8 in the units place before 488 is 488 itself. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480-489 would be 10, but the book only goes up to 488. So, let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449):**\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488):**\n   - Blocks contribute 10 each for the first four, and 9 for the last.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Yep, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? Let's see: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would also be included, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let me check each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 eights. So total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, no, let me recount. Wait, 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10*4 +9 = 49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place, plus 49 in the units place, total 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? If I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but similar to before, 8 occurs 49 times because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 eights. Wait, but 480-488 is also in the book, so does that add any eights in the tens place? Yes, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but when counting the tens place, each of these numbers has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 more eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Wait, no, because 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488/10) = 48, but wait, 488 is included, so maybe it's 49? Let me think: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences:  \n     \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\)\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.  \n     \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\)\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Hmm, wait, in the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 pages. So, the number of times is the floor of (488 / 10) which is 48, plus 1 if the last number is 484, which is exactly 484, so that's 49 times. Okay, that's correct. Now, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see, 488 is included. So, how many times? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, units place for 8's is 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the tens place for 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract 98 from 188: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place? 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 9. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9, total 49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, up to 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct. And hundreds place for 4's is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the number of 8's. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488, which includes 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's check: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting at 8, each step is +10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 380-389, because 480-489 would include 488, but 489 is beyond 488. So, how many sets? Each set is 10 numbers, so 4 sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, and so on. So yes, 4 sets, 10 each, so 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, hundreds place has 0 eights. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. 188-89=99. Yes, that seems correct.

Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Let me count how many sets there are. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98 eights.

    "text": " Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. To find the count, I can do (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the hundreds place, so from 0-488, there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each, and in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for numbers 400-409, 410-419,...,480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100. So in 400-499, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each time, but since we only go up to 488, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many full tens are there? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and then 480-488 (9 numbers). Wait, but that seems off because each hundred block (like 400-499) would have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place for each ten's group. But since we're stopping at 488, the last group is incomplete. Let me correct this. For the tens digit, in the hundreds place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299:240-249 (10). 300-399:340-349 (10). 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let me see: how many full tens are there? Each ten's group (like 40-49) is 10 numbers. So from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and then 480-488 (9). Wait, that's 8 full tens and one partial. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (80 numbers) and 9 remaining. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 8 full tens (80 numbers) plus the last 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, which is 8 sets of 10, so 80 numbers, and then 480-488 doesn't have the tens digit 4, because 480-488 has tens digit 8. Wait, no, 480-488 has tens digit 8, so the tens digit 4 in 400-488 only occurs up to 470-479. So, that's 8 sets of 10, so 80 numbers. Therefore, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs 8 times, each time 10 numbers, so 80 numbers. Therefore, total tens digit 4's: 4 sets of 10 in the first four hundreds (0-399) and 8 sets of 10 in 400-488, but wait, no, 400-488 is part of the hundreds digit, but for the tens digit, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, which is 8 sets of 10, so 80 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 sets (from 0-399) of 10 each, which is 40, plus 8 sets in 400-488 of 10 each, which is 80, so total 40 + 80 = 120? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 50. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. The tens digit 4 occurs in every block of 100 numbers, 10 times. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.). So, 4 complete hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Let's see: 401-488 includes 400-488, but 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479. Each of these is 10 numbers, but 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range. So, how many full tens are there? From 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), ..., up to 470-479 (10). That's 8 sets of 10, so 80 numbers. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 80 times. Therefore, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 80 = 120. But earlier, I thought it was 50. I must have made a mistake earlier. Wait, but when I initially thought about it, I considered 5 sets of 10, which would be 50. But now, this approach gives 120. That can't be right because the total number of tens digits in 488 numbers can't be that high. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the hundreds and tens places. Let me clarify: The tens digit 4 occurs in every block of 100 numbers, 10 times. So, from 1-100: 10 times (40-49). 101-200: 10 times (140-149). 201-300: 10 times (240-249). 301-400: 10 times (340-349). 401-488: Now, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), ..., up to 470-479 (10). That's 8 sets of 10, as 400-479 is 80 numbers, so 8 sets. So, 8 * 10 = 80. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 * 10 (from 1-400) + 8 * 10 (from 401-488) = 40 + 80 = 120. Wait, but that seems too high because in 488 numbers, the tens digit can only be 4 in 48 times, perhaps? Wait, no, because each hundred has 10 occurrences, so 4 hundreds would have 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 8 more, totaling 48. Wait, but 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-400) plus 88 more (401-488). So, in each full hundred, 10 tens digit 4's. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, how many tens digit 4's? Let's see: 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), ..., 470-479 (10). That's 8 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 80 numbers. So, 80 occurrences. Therefore, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 80 = 120. But that seems high because in 488 numbers, the tens digit can only be 4 a certain number of times. Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let me think differently. For each digit position, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula. For the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated as follows: Let me recall the formula. For the tens digit, the count is calculated as:\n\ncount = higher * 10 + min(max(0, (n - lower * 10 + 1)), 10)\n\nWhere:\n- higher is the number formed by the digits above the tens place.\n- lower is the number formed by the digits below the tens place.\n- current digit is the tens digit.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use a different approach. Let me consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nEach digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the tens place, except possibly the last partial group. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 100 are there? 4 full groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each full group contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each group). So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are from 401-488, which is 88 numbers. In these, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear in 401-488? Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449 and 450-459? Wait, no, that's the hundreds place. Wait, no, in the tens place, it's when the tens digit is 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in:\n\n- 440-449: but wait, 440-449 is part of the hundreds digit 4, but the tens digit is 4. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences.\n\nAdditionally, in 401-488, does the tens digit 4 occur anywhere else? Let's see: 401-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419: tens digit is 1. 420-429: tens digit is 2. 430-439: tens digit is 3. 440-449: tens digit is 4. 450-459: tens digit is 5. 460-469: tens digit is 6. 470-479: tens digit is 7. 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nTherefore, total tens digit 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nAh, okay, so earlier I overcounted by thinking that in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 8 times, but actually, it's only once in 401-488, which is 440-449.\n\nSo, the correct count for tens digit 4's is 50.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll consider units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's count how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? Let's do (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289:10.\n- 380-389:10.\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49+49=98.\n\nNumber of 4's:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first is 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of this. Let's count how many sets. Each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40 eights. But wait, 480-488 is another set, but it's only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers). So, in the tens place, the 8's occur in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total is 10*4 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, that's only 98? Let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total 98. Hmm, but wait, when I counted the tens place, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

Each block of 100 (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me check the tens place for eights again. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, yes, 98 eights in total. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 numbers. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? But the book ends at 488, so 480-488. So, let's see: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes I might have missed something. Let me recount the fours: Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So, 49 +50 +89 =188. Eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Hmm, wait, when I was counting the units place, I thought it was 49, but let me check again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the floor of 488 divided by 10, which is 48, but since 488 is the last number, and 488 ends with an 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 fours in the units place. Then, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but also in 40-49, 140-149, etc. Wait, but earlier I thought there are 5 sets, but let me check how many hundreds are there. From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in each hundred block once, except maybe the last one. So, 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Then, the hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers. So, let's count each hundred block: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block (400-488), which only has 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, plus89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, 488-400+1=89. So that's correct. For the tens place, fours: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place: 49 fours. So, 188 total fours. Eights: units=49, tens=49, so 98. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, except the last range (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
