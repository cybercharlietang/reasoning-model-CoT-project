    "text": " Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yep, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. Wait, but let me confirm: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets (from 0-499, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 440-449). So 5 x 10 = 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block is 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check that. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 40 +9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me make sure. Units place: 8,18,...,488. As calculated, 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets is 10, and the last is 9, so 4x10 +9=49. So, total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, for eights, the hundreds place is 0, so that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the tens and units places, it's easy to miscount. Let me verify the units place for fours again. Units place fours: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 89. So, 188 fours. Eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488 is 89 numbers, that's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488 being 9 numbers, so 49 total in tens place. Units place was 49 for both, which makes sense because both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. 8's:49 +49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Wait, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. But in each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. But in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, but the hundreds digit is 4. Wait, no, in the tens place, the 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but up to 488. Wait, no, in the tens place, within 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, 5 sets of 10, so 50.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9 eights because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, let me think: from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8.

Tens place: Each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for eights: Units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block contributes 10, except 480-488 which contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let me count how many full sets there are. Each hundred has a set of 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each block has 10 numbers, except the last one which has 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count them: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because units and tens each have 49, so 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Wait, but let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so yes, 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours. I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. Correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 occurrences each. So, yes, 49 units for 4, 49 units for 8. Tens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8. Hundreds place:89 for 4, 0 for 8. So, 4's total:49+50+89=188. 8's total:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit being 8. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488.

But actually, in the tens place, the digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

I'll go through each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let's count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that's 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. For eights, in the tens place, I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the units place for fours. Let me recount that. Units place for fours: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place, correct. Similarly, for eights in the units place, 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place, correct. So, the calculation seems accurate.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49 is 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including 488, that's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. So, from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), right? So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.

Let me count each set: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Wait, in the hundreds place for fours, I counted from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems right. For the tens place in eights, I had 5 sets but the last one only had 9 numbers, so 49 total. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last one if it's cut short.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think of it as starting at 4, which is 4 + 10*(k-1) where k is the term number. So, the last term is 484. Let me solve for k: 4 + 10*(k-1) =484 \u2192 10*(k-1)=480 \u2192 k-1=48 \u2192 k=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50 fours. From 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449.

Let's see: The first 8 is at 8, then every 10 numbers after that. The last one is 488, which is 488 = 8 + 10*(n-1). Let's solve for n: 488 = 8 + 10n -10 \u2192 488 = 10n -2 \u2192 10n = 490 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, each of the next three blocks is 10, and the last block is 9. So 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block ending at 488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). 5 sets, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is 488. So, using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that set is incomplete. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is included). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check if 480-488 is 9 numbers. 480 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 -480 +1=9. Correct. So, 40+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., which is 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488. So, how many? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I feel like that might not be right. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place of fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, which is 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484: 49 numbers. So, 188 fours. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's actually 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. There are four full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets \u00d710=40. Then, the last partial set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total is 40 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit position again for both 4's and 8's to ensure accuracy. For fours: units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets up to 440-449, which is within 488. So, 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 isn't included. So, 49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.

    "text": " Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10, and there are 5 hundreds (0-499, so 0-4 in hundreds place, but actually 1-4 in the hundreds place). Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 regardless of the hundreds digit. So, from 0-99, 10-19, etc., up to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So total fours: 49 +50 +89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, right? 488 -480 +1=9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for that last block. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counting. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let's see: 488 is the 49th number because 488 = 8 + 10*(48-1) = 8 + 470 = 478, but wait, 488 is 8 + 10*48 = 488. So, actually, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let's count each block. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the fours and eights. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Let me list a few: 8,18,28,...,488. That's correct, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book goes up to 488, the next set would be 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8 in the tens place. Let me count how many sets there are. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, the tens place 8's are 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, no, because each hundred block up to 400 would have 10 each, and then in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 8,18,...,488. Let me count: from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th group includes 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, and the last set 480-488 contributes 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? It's similar to the 4's case. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but including 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is 8 in the units place, so yes, that's 49 eights. So, units place:49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last one). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is included, which is within 488, so 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, yes, 188 fours. For eights, units place:49, tens place:49. So, 98 eights. Therefore, 188-98=90.

The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me see: 488 is the 49th number because (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49.

    "text": " Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, wait. 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just quickly check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yep, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the units digit in 8,18,...,488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total: 98. Difference: 188-98=90. Hmm, seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. I said 440-449 is 10 fours, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So that's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, I had 480-488 being 9 numbers, which is correct.

Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, so let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because it starts from 8. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 =40 and 9, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 49. Correct. Units place for both fours and eights: 49 each.

From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but including both 8 and 488, that's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each of these sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digits can be 0,1,2,3,4.

Let me count: 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers.

So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of 4's: 49 (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   - Number of 4's: 50 (5 sets of 10 numbers each).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in numbers from 400-488.  \n   - Number of 4's: 89 (from 400 to 488, inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of 8's: 49 (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 49 (4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9 numbers).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Calculating the difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
