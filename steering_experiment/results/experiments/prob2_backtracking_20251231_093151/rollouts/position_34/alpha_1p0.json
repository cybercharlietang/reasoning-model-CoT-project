    "text": " When counting units place, I thought 484 is the 49th occurrence, so 49 fours in units. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. Now, moving on to the number of 8's. Let me do the same approach: count 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last occurrence is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last block is 380-389. So, how many blocks? Each block is 10 numbers. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-489 isn't fully included because the book ends at 488. So, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 would be 9 numbers (480-488), but since we're only counting the tens digit, each of those has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier I thought the blocks are 80-89, etc., each giving 10 eights. So, up to 380-389, that's 4 blocks, each giving 10 eights, so 40. Then, the next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's an additional 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's different from my initial thought. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify: For tens place, each block of 100 numbers has one block where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, up to 380-389, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but earlier I thought the tens place had 40, but now I'm getting 49. Let me make sure. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 480-488, which is 9 more, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of fours was 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place, 49; tens place, 50; hundreds place, 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. For eights: units place, 49; tens place, 49. So, 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the tens place for fours. Let me check again. Tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each giving 10 fours, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. Units place for fours: from 4, 14, ..., 484. How many? Let's see, 484 is 484, so (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. For eights: units place, same as fours, 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10*4 + 9 = 49. Correct. So, 49 + 49 = 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When I count the units place for fours, I included 484, which is correct. For eights, the units place goes up to 488, which is included, so that's correct as well. For the tens place, in the case of eights, 480-488 is correct because 488 is the last page, so that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 49 in units and 49 in tens for eights, totaling 98. So, the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Additionally, in the range 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds:89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 380-389 is within that, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these sets contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9 eights. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, so 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no, because 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, and 380-389 is another 10, making 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 more, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. When counting the units place, I thought from 4 to 484, which is every 10 numbers. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then the 484 adds one more, making it 49. So, that seems correct. Now, for the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks, so 5*10=50. That seems right. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers are there? The last one is 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds one more. So, 48+1=49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many sets: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct. But let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but when I counted the fours in the units place, I went up to 484, which is 484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for 8's, the last number is 488, which is included, so 49 eights. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98 eights.\n\nFor fours, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach to make sure. Maybe using a formula or another counting method.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, we can calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nFor units place:\n\nFor any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(n/10)\n\nIf the last group has d in the units place, add 1.\n\nSimilarly for tens place: number of complete groups of 100: floor(n/100)\n\nIn each group, the digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nIf the last partial group has numbers where the tens digit is d, add the count.\n\nFor hundreds place: similar approach.\n\nLet me apply this to both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, counting the number of 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nn=488\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48\n\nCheck if the last group (481-488) has a 4 in the units place: 484 is within 480-488, so yes. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4\n\nEach group contributes 10 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.)\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, check the last partial group (400-488). The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, add 10.\n\nTotal tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: floor(488/1000)=0\n\nBut since we're dealing with hundreds place, we look at how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place. That's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nn=488\n\nComplete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48\n\nCheck if the last group (481-488) has an 8 in the units place: 488 is present, so add 1.\n\nTotal units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nComplete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4\n\nEach group contributes 10 8's in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.)\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, check the last partial group (400-488). The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488 inclusive: 488 -480 +1=9 numbers.\n\nSo, add 9.\n\nTotal tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, no numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. So, units place: the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. Yes, that's correct. So units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. So, how many full sets do we have? From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. That seems correct. But wait, let me double-check the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours in the tens place for the 400s. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49+50+89=188.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that would be 49 numbers, but wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Let me count how many sets of 10 there are. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, but wait a minute: in the tens place, when I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, right? But 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for the other sets. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many numbers? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89 fours. 49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, and the last is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets of 10 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences (since the book ends at 488).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. For units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers, so total number is floor(488/10) + 1 if the last number is 484, which is 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing a 4 in the units place, and then 484 is the 49th. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: as above, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so how many such numbers are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. Because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, totaling 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units place: 49 eights, correct. Tens place: 49 eights, correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me cross-verify this because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me recount the units place for fours: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for fours: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place for fours: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So total fours:49+50+89=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488: same as fours, 49 numbers. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So total eights:49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. But let me check another way. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: For any digit d (0-9), the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the last digit is >=d else 0). Wait, no, more accurately, it's floor((n + 1)/10) if d !=0, but perhaps it's better to think as (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0) when d !=0. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as for each position, the count is determined by higher digits. Let me try to formalize this. For units digit, the number of times 4 appears is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488//10=48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488//10=48, remainder 8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49. Similarly for 8: 488//10=48, remainder 8, which is >=8, so 48+1=49. So, that's correct. For tens digit: The number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated by looking at the hundreds digit. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times per hundred. The number of hundreds is 4 (since 488 is in the 400s). Wait, no, wait. Let me think differently. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each: 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. So, correct. For hundreds digit: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. 8 appears in 800-899, but since our book ends at 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, but let me make sure about the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, which is 49. So, that's correct. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that right? Let me count again. Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which only has 9 because 489 is beyond 488. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, but earlier I thought 188 -98=90. Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. That seems correct.

I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is the 49th occurrence.

So total in tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these, but how many numbers? 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so total eights are 98, and total fours are 188. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nBut wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check again.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for fours. I said from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10. So, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor eights, in the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: both fours and eights have 49 each, so that's consistent.\n\nWait, but wait, when counting units place for fours, does 484 count as the 49th? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The step is 10 each time, starting at 4. So, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. Let's set that equal to 484: 4 + (n-1)*10 =484 \u2192 (n-1)*10=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So yes, 49 terms. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. Let's check if 488 is included. 488 is 8 more than 480, so yes, it's the 49th term. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Eights: no hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for fours? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Let me calculate 488 - 400 +1 =89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for eights, the hundreds place is 0, as the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each (4 \u00d7 10 = 40), and the last block contributes 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting. Because when I count the units place, I included numbers like 44, which has two fours. Similarly, 444 would have three fours, but in this case, up to 488, the highest is 444, right? So, maybe I should consider overlapping counts. Hmm, perhaps my initial approach is correct because each digit position is considered separately. So, for each position, I count how many times 4 appears, regardless of other digits. So, 44 would be counted once in the units and once in the tens, so that's correct. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full steps, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 + 10*(48) = 8 + 480 = 488. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, only has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount. For the fours: units place: from 4, 14, ..., 484. Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so that's 49 numbers (including both 4 and 484). Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. For the eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 - 8 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place in fours, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? Yes, because 440,441,...,449 is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number because 484 = 4 + 10*(48). So, 48 intervals of 10, plus the first number, makes 49. So, that's correct. So, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately, and for each position, calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then sum them up. Let me try that for confirmation. For units place: For each page number, the units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. But wait, in each group of 10, the units digit goes from 0-9, so each digit 0-9 appears once. So, in 48 complete groups, each digit appears 48 times. But then, we have 8 remaining numbers (since 48*10=480, so 481-488). In these remaining 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8. So, in the units place, we have 48 fours and 48 eights, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units fours: 48, units eights: 48 +1=49. That matches what I had before. Similarly, for tens place: Each group of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, etc.) and 10 where it's 8 (80-89, etc.). So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit cycles again. In 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, in 401-488, tens fours:10, tens eights:9. So, total tens fours:40+10=50, tens eights:40+9=49. That matches what I had before. Now, hundreds place: For hundreds digit, in 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution. In 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no. 200-299: 2, no. 300-399:3, no. 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 numbers. So, hundreds fours:89, hundreds eights:0. So, total fours: units(48)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=187. Wait, wait, earlier I had 188. Hmm, discrepancy here. Wait, in the units place, I had 48 fours from the complete groups and 0 from the remaining 8 numbers (since the remaining units digits were 1-8, so no 4). So, units fours:48. Tens fours:50. Hundreds fours:89. So, total fours:48+50+89=187. Wait, but earlier I had 188. So, where did I go wrong? Let me check again. In the first approach, I considered units place as 49 fours, but in this approach, it's 48. Which is correct? Let me recount. The total number of page numbers is 488. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4. So, units fours:48. But earlier, I thought it was 49. So, that's a mistake. So, correct units fours:48. Similarly, units eights:48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights, plus in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (at 488), so units eights:49. So, in the first approach, I had units fours as 49, which is incorrect. It should be 48. So, correcting that, total fours would be units(48)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=187. Similarly, eights would be units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, but now I'm confused because in the initial approach, I had 188 fours, but this approach gives 187. Which is correct? Let me think carefully. Let's list out the units fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. But according to the other approach, it's 48 fours. So, which is correct? Wait, perhaps the error is in the second approach. Because when I did the complete groups, I considered 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so no 4. So, total units fours:48. But according to the arithmetic sequence, it's 49. So, which is correct? Let's see: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20,...,481-490). But wait, 48*10=480, so 481-490 would be the 49th decade, but our book ends at 488, so only 481-488 are present. So, in the 49th decade, only 8 numbers are present, from 481-488. So, in the units place, how many 4's are there? Only one: at 484. So, in the 49th decade, there's one 4 in the units place. So, total units fours:48 (from the first 48 decades) +1=49. So, that's correct. So, in the second approach, I made a mistake by not considering that the 49th decade starts at 481 and ends at 490, but we only go up to 488, so we have one 4 in the units place in that partial decade. Therefore, units fours:49. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights: units(49) + tens(49)=98. So, difference:188-98=90. So, the correct answer is 90 more fours than eights. I think my initial approach was correct, and the second approach had a miscalculation because I didn't account for the partial decade correctly. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of such occurrences: 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4 \u2192 49 occurrences (including both 4 and 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of such occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of such occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 49 occurrences (including both 8 and 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. When counting units place, I thought it was 49, but maybe it's 48? Because from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, yes, 49. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, does that add an extra 4? Let me see: 4,14,...,484, which is 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10, so n-1 = (484-4)/10 = 480/10=48, so n=49. So yes, 49 fours in units place. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, last is 488.

From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights. So total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in hundreds place. Now, adding up eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counting again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't overcount in the hundreds place for fours. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. That seems right. And in the tens place for fours, it's 50, which is 10 per hundred block times 5 blocks (40-49,140-149, etc.), but wait, 440-449 is the fifth block, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50. Units place 49, so total 188. For eights, units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks give 40, and 480-488 gives 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many, I can calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So yes, 49 fours in the units place. Tens place: Each hundred block contributes 10 fours in the tens place, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but in the 400-488 block, the tens digit can be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d710 =50 fours in the tens place. Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last occurrence is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many full sets of 10 are there? From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 +9=40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake. Let me recount the units place for eights: from 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct. So total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. So 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights.

    "text": " When I was counting the units place, I thought it was 49 fours, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, the number of fours in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra if the last partial decade includes a 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. But wait, the last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, actually, the number of fours in the units place is 48, not 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier by including 484 as the 49th, but actually, 484 is within the 48th decade (480-489), but since the book ends at 488, the 484 is included. Wait, no, 480-489 is the 48th decade, but the book only goes up to 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the 48th decade, the units digit 4 occurs once at 484. So, actually, the number of fours in the units place is 48 (from 4,14,...,474) plus 1 more at 484, making it 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. So, maybe it's 49 fours in the units place. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think differently. The number of fours in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the ones place from 1 to 488. So, for each ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total fours in units place: 48. Similarly, for the tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. Wait, no, 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers (400-409), but 400-409 is part of the 400-488 range. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 fours. Wait, but 400-409 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, units place: 48 fours, tens place: 50 fours, hundreds place: 89 fours (from 400-488). So total fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, earlier I thought 188, but now I'm getting 187. Let me check again. Units place: 48 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total fours: 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n- 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total eights: 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187 fours and 98 eights, so difference is 89. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted the fours in the hundreds place, I said from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place fours: 48, because from 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place, and there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, and the last partial decade (481-488) doesn't include a 4 in the units place. So, 48 fours in units place.\n\nTens place fours: 50, as each hundred contributes 10, and in 400-488, another 10 in 400-409, making it 50.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 fours.\n\nEights: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187 fours and 98 eights, so the difference is 89. That seems correct.\n\nBut let me check again for units place fours. From 1-488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? They are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place fours: 49. Wait, earlier I thought 48, but now I'm getting 49. Which is correct?\n\nWait, 484 is included in the book, so the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place fours: 49. So, earlier I was wrong when I thought it was 48; it's actually 49.\n\nSo, let's correct that. Units place fours: 49. Tens place fours: 50. Hundreds place fours: 89. Total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, so I was wrong earlier when I thought it was 187. It's actually 188 fours.\n\nSimilarly, eights: units place 49, tens place 49, total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90 as the difference. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, units place fours: 49.\n\nTens place fours: 50.\n\nHundreds place fours: 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought units place fours were 48; actually, they're 49, so total fours are 188.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place fours. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, which is 10 numbers (400-409). So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place fours: 49, as calculated.\n\nHundreds place fours: 89 (400-488).\n\nSo, total fours: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and in the 400-488 range, another 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each hundred contributes 10, and in 480-488, there are 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8 since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. So, units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours, but wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 48th set plus one more? Wait, no, because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,...,484. Let me count how many: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. So, units place is 49 fours. Tens place: as above, 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but the 8's will appear every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last number, so does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me see: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I count correctly? Let me verify again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Number of blocks:  \n     From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n     - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so:  \n       \\[\n       5 \\times 10 = 50\n       \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Number of blocks:  \n     From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n     - The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers.  \n     - Total occurrences:  \n       \\[\n       4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n       \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated as floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the last term is less than or equal to 488. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(48.8) is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. Now, for the tens place, I have 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. That's correct because 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours in the tens place. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Then, the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488 with step 10. The count would be floor(488 / 10) + 1. 488 / 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 eights.\n- 280-289: 10 eights.\n- 380-389: 10 eights.\n- 480-488: Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 eights each, so 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total is 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights, tens place: 49 eights, so total 98 eights. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 49 eights in the tens place. So total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of those numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For fours, in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the case of the tens place for eights, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSo, fours: 188, eights:98, difference:90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any cases. For example, in the units place, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, it does, so that's included in the 49 eights. Similarly, 484 has a 4 in the units place, which is included in the 49 fours.\n\nWait, but let me recount the fours in the units place. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. How many numbers is that? The first number is 4, the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the eights in the units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for fours: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place for eights: 80-89, 180-189, etc., each 10 numbers, except the last set which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets \u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for eights: none, since 800 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any chance I double-counted or missed a case? For example, in the hundreds place for fours, 400-488 includes numbers like 404, 414, etc., which have both 4 in hundreds and another 4 elsewhere. But I'm only counting the hundreds place here, so each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, regardless of other digits. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 includes numbers like 484, which has an 8 in the tens place and a 4 in the units place, but I'm only counting the 8 in the tens place, so that's fine.\n\nI think I've covered all cases. So, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many that is.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, how many full sets of 10 do we have? Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So yes, 89. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I count the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 4 full sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 and 9, total 49. So, units place:49, tens place:49, so 98 eights. Fours were 188, so 188-98=90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: when counting the units place for 4's, I considered up to 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for 8's, up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for both is 49. Then, for tens place, 4's had 50 (from 40-49,140-149,...440-449) and 8's had 49 (from 80-89,180-189,...480-488). Hundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. So, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 has a units digit of 8, the last 4 is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, but 488 is included, so 49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 10 per 100. From 0-488, that's 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399) and then 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10. So, 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) and one partial hundred contributing 10, so total 5*10=50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: each hundred block has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 0-99:80-89, 100-199:180-189, 200-299:280-289, 300-399:380-389, and 400-488:480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's: since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers.

So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489. But the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1=9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Hmm, so 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, fours are 188, eights are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for eights. Let me recount that. For eights in the tens place, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That's correct. So, eights in the tens place are 49. Similarly, units place: 49. So, total eights are 98. Fours are 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. So, units place: numbers ending with 4 from 1 to 488. The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The nth term is 10n - 6 = 484. So, 10n = 490, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That's correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1 to 488, how many hundreds? 400-488 is the last hundred. So, 400-488 is the 4th hundred? Wait, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500. But our book ends at 488, so the last hundred is 401-488. So, how many hundreds have a tens place 4? 40-49 is in 1-100, then 140-149 in 101-200, 240-249 in 201-300, 340-349 in 301-400, and 440-449 in 401-488. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. That's correct. Hundreds place: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These occur in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many sets? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, units place: 49, tens place:49, total 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place there. So, in total, for the tens place, it's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9, which is 49. So, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the count for units place of 8's. The last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's included. So, starting from 8, every 10th number up to 488. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place: 4,14,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 484-4=480, so 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\left(\\frac{484 - 4}{10}\\right) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n   So, there are 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n   So, there are 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of terms} = \\left(\\frac{488 - 8}{10}\\right) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks each contribute 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n   So, there are 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers from 800-899, so there are 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**\n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 4,14,...,484. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we include both 4 and 484, that's 49 numbers. So 49 fours in units. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many sets there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. From 80-89: 10 eights in tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers (480 is the first, 488 is the ninth because 488 - 480 = 8, so 9 numbers). So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I thought about the tens place, I got 49, and units also 49, so total 98. But let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 49 numbers, correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 188, and eights at 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the fours. Units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nEights: Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place, 440-449 is counted correctly? Yes, because 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. And 480-488 is correctly counted as 9 numbers for the tens place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included in the hundreds place. Yes, 488 is 4 in the hundreds place, so that's included in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, another way to think about the hundreds place: 400-499 would have 100 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the total number of digits. Let me see: 1-9: 9 pages, 10-99: 90 pages, 100-488: 389 pages. So, total pages: 9+90+389=488, correct.\n\nNow, for the units place: in each set of 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8. So, in 488 pages, how many sets of 10 are there? 48 full sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48*1=48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which is a 4, and 488 is an 8. So, in the last partial set, we have one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units fours: 48+1=49, units eights:48+1=49. That matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: in each set of 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8. So, for the first 400 pages (1-400), how many sets of 100 are there? 4 sets: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each set has 10 fours in tens place and 10 eights in tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Now, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 again. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there? For tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in 401-488, we have 10 fours and 9 eights in the tens place. So, total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50, eights:40 +9=49. Wait, that's different from my earlier count. Earlier I had 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but in the initial count, I had 5 sets of 10 fours in the tens place, which would be 50, but according to this breakdown, it's 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 10 in 440-449, making 50. Similarly, for eights, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 in 480-488, making 49. So, total fours in tens place:50, eights:49. So, that's consistent with my earlier count.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, eights were 49, which matches this breakdown. So, total eights in tens place:49, fours:50.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) =98, fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=188.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the hundreds place for eights. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, eights in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe 90 was high, but after checking, it seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as counting the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally except possibly the last partial set.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10:48 (since 48*10=480). Each set has one 4 and one 8. So, 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nThen, the last 8 numbers:481-488. Units digits:1-8. So, 4 is present once (484), and 8 is present once (488). So, total units fours:48+1=49, units eights:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-400). Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So, in the tens place:\n\n- Tens digit 4: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 8: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nTotal tens fours:40+10=50, tens eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 100-488: hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4.\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)=188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 8 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, the last 8 in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from the last set, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488: that's 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 eights, and tens place 49, so total 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with inclusive counts.\n\nFor units place fours: from 4,14,24,...,484. Let's see, 484 is the 49th because 484 = 4 + 10*(n-1). So, 484 = 4 + 10n -10 => 484 = 10n -6 => 10n = 490 => n=49. So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nTens place fours: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in tens place.\n\nHundreds place fours: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th, so 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Because 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in eights, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set.\n\nSo, total eights: 49.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any chance I double-counted or missed a digit? For example, in numbers like 448, does the 4 in the hundreds place and the 4 in the tens place both count? Yes, because each digit is counted separately. So, 448 has two 4's, both are counted in their respective places.\n\nSimilarly, 488 has an 8 in the tens and units place, so both are counted.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours printed is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. Let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 49, which seems correct.\n\nAnd for 4's, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct.\n\nWait, but when I count units place for 4's, I thought 484 is the last one, which is 484, so that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 49 numbers. Similarly for 8's, 488 is the last one, so 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. For units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which is 48 fours, and then the 49th is at 484. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0-8 in the tens place (since 488 is the last). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, which gives 48 eights, and then the 49th would be at 488. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count how many sets. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there's one set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and then 9 in 400-488, so 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights: 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the units and tens for fours and eights. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.

There are 49 such occurrences (from 4 to 484).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit '4' appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).

There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit '8' appears in blocks of 10 numbers within each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 occurrences, and an additional 9 occurrences in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's than '8's in the page numbers. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. That's correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. That's 484 /10 = 48.4, but since we include 484, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 fours in units. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So, 50 fours in tens. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers, right? Because 8,18,...,488. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 is the 9th in that set). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 eights in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in hundreds place. Now, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. When I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. That seems correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. Units place for 4's: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems right.

Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last page, so it ends with 88, so 488 is included. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. So, each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98 eights. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. As 488 is included, that's 49 eights. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4*10 +9=49. So total eights: 49+49=98. So, the number of fours is 188 and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Wait, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that block. So, 4 full blocks (each contributing 10) and one partial block contributing 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place, plus 49 in units place, total 98 eights. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. For fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). 49+50=99, plus 89=188. For eights: units (49), tens (49). 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Number of 4's:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188 fours**.\n\n2. **Counting the Number of 8's:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98 eights**.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = **90 more fours**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 is correct. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Okay, now let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so that's 4 full blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Wait, when counting the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. But wait, in the tens place, each set of 100 has 10 fours, so 100 numbers: 10 fours in tens place. So, 400-499 would have 10 fours in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, does that affect the count? Wait, no, because 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets of 10, 50 fours in tens place. Okay, that's correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full sets (each contributing 10 eights) and one partial set from 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems correct. So, total eights are 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. Another way to approach this is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For both 4 and 8, it's every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? Let's calculate it as floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is the last number, 488/10=48.8, so 49 times. Similarly for 8, same calculation: 49 times. So, units place: 49 each. For tens place: For each digit, it's 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 4 in tens place, how many times? From 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each 100 numbers contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, total number of hundreds is 4 (since 400-488 is the fourth hundred). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds go up to 400-499, but the book stops at 488. So, the number of complete hundreds where the tens digit is 4 is 5: 40-49 (first hundred), 140-149 (second hundred), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Similarly, for 8 in tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9 eights (since 488 is the last page). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, that's correct. For hundreds place: For 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. For 8, there's no hundreds digit in any page number since the book ends at 488, so 0. So, adding up: fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct. So, yeah, I think the answer is 90. But just to be thorough, maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense. Alternatively, maybe I can write a small table to count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nWait, another way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4: The number of times 4 appears in units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the remainder is >=4. Since 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n- For 8: Similarly, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod10=8, which is exactly 8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: The number of times 4 appears in tens place is calculated by considering each hundred. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many hundreds are there? From 0-488, there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). In each of the first four hundreds, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. In the fifth hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total for 4 in tens place: 5*10=50.\n- For 8: Similarly, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. However, in the fifth hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, total for 8 in tens place: 4*10 (from first four hundreds) +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- For 8: The hundreds digit is 8 would be from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n- Difference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident now that the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal '4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n1. **Units place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488, contributing 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit from 400-488 can still be 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me count each block:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place was 49, so total 98. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and eights are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for eights. Let me recount:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights in the tens place\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nAnd for fours, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there.\n\nWait, but when I added up fours, I had units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Let me check units place for fours: 4,14,24,...,484. How many is that? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and there are 5 blocks (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188 fours.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for fours, do I include 400-488? Because 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, yes, 50 fours in tens place.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for eights, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for eights again. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The last number is 488, which is included. So, 488 is 48*10 +8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The number of fours is 188, eights is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using digit positions more formally. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor a 3-digit number, the hundreds digit can be 1-4 (since 488 is the max), tens and units can be 0-9.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- For each digit from 0-9, in each block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once. So, for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each block, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 blocks contribute 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: fours=48+1=49, eights=48+1=49.\n\nThat's consistent with earlier.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly 10 where it's 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nIn 488 pages, how many complete hundreds blocks are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), and then 88 pages in the 400-488 range.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (400-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nSimilarly, 80-89 in the tens place would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 eights.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, fours in tens place:10, eights:9.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\nFours:40 (from first four hundreds) +10 (from 400-488) =50.\n\nEights:40 +9=49.\n\nThat's consistent with earlier counts.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nOnly numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nEights in hundreds place: since the book ends at 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) =188.\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked each part, so I'm confident the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. For the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488) where 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. That seems correct. For the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers.

For the hundreds place, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. So, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then the last partial ten is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 + 1 = 9)\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that adds up to 49 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, earlier I thought the units place had 49 eights and the tens place 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the units place in fours: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which is 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then the 49th 4 is at 484, which is within the last partial ten (481-488). So, 49 fours in units place.\n\nFor the tens place in fours: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: 8, 18, ..., 488. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n\nBut wait, let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nAnother way to count the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10) + 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, for units digit, it's the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers have one 4 in units place, so 488 // 10 = 48, and if the last number is >=4, we add 1. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so units digit fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, tens place: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, how many hundreds are there? 4 (0-399), and then 400-488. So, from 0-399, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits place: same logic, 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8 >=8, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-399, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " When counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, from 0-99, the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. And 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems right. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of terms can be calculated as floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 4)/10 = 484/10 = 48.4, floor is 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 fours in units place. That adds up to 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in units place is 488. How many such numbers? Let's see: the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (480)/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see: 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399: 380-389:10. 400-488: 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, for 400-488, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems. Let me recount the number of 8's, especially in the tens place. For the tens place, each hundred block (except the last one) contributes 10 eights. So, 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98 eights. For fours: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify. Another way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place: floor(N/10) + (1 if the last digit is >= d else 0), but if d=0, it's a bit different. But in this case, d=4 and 8, so we can use this formula.\n\nWait, actually, more accurately, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10) if d \u2260 0. Wait, let me think. For example, from 1 to N, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is floor(N/10), plus 1 if the remainder (N mod 10) is >=4. Wait, no, actually, it's floor((N + (10 - d))/10). Hmm, maybe I should look for a standard formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with my initial counting method, which gave me 49 fours in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds, totaling 188 fours, and 49 eights in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98 eights. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nWait, but when I was counting the units place for 4's, I thought the last number was 484, which is 4 in the units place. But 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is correct, so that's 49 fours in units.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, the last number is 488, so that's included, so 49 eights in units.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial count, I had 49 eights in units and 49 in tens, totaling 98. So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of it another way. Let's consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488 mod 10 >=4 else 0). 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488 mod 10 >=8 else 0). 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. How many complete hundred blocks are there? 488 is in the 400-499 block, but we only go up to 488. So, the number of complete hundred blocks is 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 0-99: 80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nFor 8's: There are no page numbers from 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \u230a488/10\u230b + 1 (since 488 mod 10 \u2265 4) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - However, in the 400-488 block, 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \u230a488/10\u230b + 1 (since 488 mod 10 = 8) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 4 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n   - In the 400-488 block, 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. For units place, the number of fours from 1 to 488: every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would give 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 8 more in the next partial ten (481-488). So, 48*1 + 8 = 56 fours in the units place? Hmm, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, the number of times the digit 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1)/10). Wait, but maybe I should think differently. Let me list them: 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94,104,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, n-1 = (484 - 4)/10 = 480/10 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. That's correct. So, units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,38,48,58,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The last one is 488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488 with step 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me recount the tens place for fours. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets. So, 5*10=50. That's correct. For eights in the tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me think again: in the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the hundreds place, none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, yes, 90 seems correct. I think I did it right.

And units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so 48 +1=49. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. So, 8's can appear in units, tens, or hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does that mean the units digit 8 appears 49 times? Let me check: starting at 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8 in the units place. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The number of terms is given by ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many sets? 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Wait, but wait, 80-89: yes, that's 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. So, 4 sets, so 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89 eights. Wait, but wait, let me check the tens place again. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, so 40. So, total eights: 49 +40=89. So, number of fours is 188, number of eights is 89. Now, the problem asks how many more fours than eights. So, 188 -89=99. So, there are 99 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer is 99 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, giving 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the units place. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is >=4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 4 in the 49th position (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct. Similarly, in the tens place, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8, so the 4 in the tens place occurs only once in each hundred except the last one. Wait no, actually, each hundred block has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. So that's correct. And the hundreds place is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which ends with 8. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th is 488. So, 48 +1=49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, number of eights is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me recount the number of 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many terms are there? If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, let's count. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in the tens or units place. For fours: units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The last number is 484. The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. Each set is 10 numbers. How many sets? From 40-49 is 10, then each hundred block adds another 10. So, 400-488: wait, no, the tens place 4's are in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's five sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Because when considering the tens place, from 40-49, that's 10 fours, and then each subsequent hundred block (140-149, etc.) adds another 10. So, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That seems right. And the hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place: 49 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. To find the count, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, how many sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights in the tens place from that set. So total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. Similarly, for fours in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10, so 5*10=50. And hundreds place for fours: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for fours: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, yes, 49 fours in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. Total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.

From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, each of these has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 eights in the tens place for the 480-488 range.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The hundreds place is 4 for 480-488, so the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place for that last block.\n\nSo, total eights in tens place: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place, I considered 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units were 49 and tens were 49, so total eights are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours are 188, total eights are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for fours. Let me recount the tens place for fours.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nThat's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, for fours, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nUnits place for fours: 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Correct.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units:8,18,...,488:49\n- Tens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488:10+10+10+10+9=49\n- Hundreds: none.\n\nSo, 98 eights.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I counted correctly for the units place of fours. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there?\n\nThe formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1.\n\nSo, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: same calculation. Last term is 488, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nOkay, I think I'm confident now. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place up to 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. For the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's indeed 89 numbers. For the tens place, each hundred block has 10, and there are 4 full hundreds before 400, but wait, no. Actually, from 1-400, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in each hundred block: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 340-349. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That seems right. Units place: 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers, so 49 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which would be 48 eights, but does 488 count as the 49th? Yes, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9. Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, let me confirm that. 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. For the tens place of 4's, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. That seems correct. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89, total 188. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " Another way: for the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For the tens place, in each hundred block, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, but 400-409 would have 4 in the tens place as well. Wait, no, 400-409: the tens digit is 0, so that's not 4. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct this. In the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.

Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence (since 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers).

Let's count how many sets there are. Each 100 numbers has one set of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, that's 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens eights:40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights.

    "text": " Another way to think about it: for each digit position, count how many times 4 appears. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 fours, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488/10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups of 10, and then an extra 8 pages. So, the units place would have 48 fours from the full groups, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit is 4 at 484. So, total units fours: 48 +1=49. That matches my earlier count. Tens place: same logic. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 400-488. So, how many times does the tens digit cycle through 0-9? From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles once more, so another 10 fours in 440-449, but wait, 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So total tens fours: 4*10 +10=50. That matches. Hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So total fours: 49+50+89=188. Okay, that seems correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 8 in the units place. So, starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8 in the units place, and then the last partial group (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, total units 8's: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within the book. So, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, contributing 10 numbers. From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 tens 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens 8's: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 numbers.

So, 4*10=40 eights in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49+40=89.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 4 sets, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 488 < 800. So total eights are 49+40=89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be 0, so total eights are 89. Now, the fours were 188, and eights are 89.

So, 49 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50 fours in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. As before, 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each set has 10 numbers, so 4 sets, 4*10=40 eights.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, so 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+40=89.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -89=99.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 -400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights, the tens place: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-489 would be next, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Wait a minute, did I miss that? Because in my earlier count, I considered up to 380-389, but actually, 480-488 is another set where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 more eights in the tens place. So, that changes the count.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Plus the units place, which is 49. So, total eights would be 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. So, I think I initially missed that 480-488 is another set where the tens digit is 8, but since the book ends at 488, that set only has 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 eights.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, total fours:188, total eights:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for eights was 40, but now it's 49 because I included the 480-488 set. So, that changes the total.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n\n- 180-189:10.\n\n- 280-289:10.\n\n- 380-389:10.\n\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) =98.\n\nSo, the number of fours is 188, eights is 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 99, but now it's 90. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made another mistake. Let me check the units place for eights. The units digit is 8 in numbers like 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting at 8, each step of 10. The last number is 488. So, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first)/step)+1. So, ((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as above, 49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights:98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 99. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count of eights. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe I overcounted the tens place for eights.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers:480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for that set.\n\nSo, total tens place eights:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total eights:98.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me check the fours again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99+89=188. Correct.\n\nEights: units:49, tens:49. 49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets contribute 10 eights each, and the last set (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
