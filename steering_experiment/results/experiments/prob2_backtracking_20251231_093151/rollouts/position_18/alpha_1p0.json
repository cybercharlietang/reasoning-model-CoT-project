    "text": " Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 480-488, which includes 484 but not 490, which is beyond. So, the units digit 4 occurs 48 times? Or is it 49 times? Wait, let me think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (pages 40-49), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so 50 times. But wait, let me check: from 0 to 488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? Each hundred has a 40-49 range, so for each hundred, that's 10 numbers. There are 4 hundreds in 488 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be pages 400-488. Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th number because (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, units place 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 (pages 80-89), 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 380-389 is within 488, but 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is the last page. So, 4 ranges, 40 numbers. So, tens place 8's:40. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's:0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:49 +40 +0=89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:188 -89=99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. Total=89. Difference=188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here as pages go up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is the last digit. So, every 10 numbers, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So that's 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 count? 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers instead of 10. Therefore, the tens place 8's are 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 numbers in 480-488. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens: 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:** \n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1? No, that might not be right. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48. But wait, the last set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. In that last partial set, 484 is included, so that's an extra 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) from 100-199: 140-149 (10) from 200-299: 240-249 (10) from 300-399: 340-349 (10) from 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? From 1 to 488, the last number with 8 in units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes only 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10) 100-199: 180-189 (10) 200-299: 280-289 (10) 300-399: 380-389 (10) 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the tens place for 8's again. The blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So yes, 49 in tens place. Units place: 49, as calculated. So total 8's:98. 4's:188. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me think: the first 4 is at 4, which is the 4th number, and then every 10 numbers after that. So, starting from 4, adding 10 each time: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term can be given by 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100, that's 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, 140-149: another 10. In 201-300, 240-249: 10. In 301-400, 340-349: 10. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449: 10 numbers. So, how many blocks is that? From 1-400, there are four blocks (each 100 numbers), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but from 401-488, is 440-449 entirely within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers are there? The first occurrence is at 8, the last at 488. Let me use the same method as before. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, there are 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are and the partial one. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, from 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289: 10. 301-400: 380-389: 10. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit of N is >= the digit we're counting. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, the last block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4,14,...,484 is 48 numbers. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to floor(N/10) + (1 if N%10 >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly N/10 times, but since N might not be a multiple of 10, we have to adjust. For example, if N is 488, then the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, because every 10 numbers contribute one 4. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place in this last block. So, total 4's in units place: 48 times. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48, and since the last block ends at 8, 8 does appear once more, so 48 +1=49 times. Wait, no, let me clarify. For units digit 8: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? They are 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and then in the last block, 488 is included, which is another 8. So total 49 times. So, 4's in units place: 48, 8's in units place:49. So, 4's are less than 8's in units place by 1. But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me structure this properly. I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8, then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once: 4,14,24,...,484.\n   - The last such number is 484, which is 48th occurrence because 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => n=49? Wait, no, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Wait, no, the count is from 4 to 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think differently. The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The sequence is 4 + 10k where k=0 to m. So, 4 +10m =484 => 10m=480 => m=48. So, there are 49 terms (k=0 to 48). So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n   - This is when the tens digit is 4, so numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Let's see how many such blocks there are.\n   - From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges:\n     - 40-49: 10 numbers\n     - 140-149: 10 numbers\n     - 240-249:10\n     - 340-349:10\n     - 440-449:10\n   - Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5*10=50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n   - This is when the hundreds digit is 4, so numbers from 400-488.\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n   - But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only in 400-499, but our book ends at 488, so from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 exactly 89 times.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488.\n   - How many terms? Let's see: 8 +10k <=488.\n   - 488-8=480, so k=0 to 48, which is 49 terms. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n   - Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it.\n   - Let's count:\n     - 80-89: 10 numbers\n     - 180-189:10\n     - 280-289:10\n     - 380-389:10\n     - 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n   - So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. So, 89.\n\nFor the 4's in the tens place, from 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50 times.\n\nUnits place:49 times.\n\nTotal 4's:89+50+49=188.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. When I count from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's 49 times.\n\nBut in the tens place, 4's have 50, and 8's have 49.\n\nIn hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units place (ones place):**\n     - Numbers ending with 4: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n     - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - Numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n     - Each range contributes 10 numbers, except 440-449, which is fully within 488.\n     - Total: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - Numbers where the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488.\n     - Total: 89 occurrences (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units place (ones place):**\n     - Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n     - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - Numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n     - Each range contributes 10 numbers, except 480-488, which contributes 9.\n     - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - No numbers in 1-488 have 8 as the hundreds digit.\n     - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as for every 10 pages, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but each contributes one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit cycles 48 times, each contributing a 4 once. So, 48 times. Wait, but when I count from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times, each contributing a 4 once, so that's 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Well, from 0-99, 40-49 is one range, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 ranges * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 ranges, 10 numbers each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. Pages from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. So, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. That's 49 numbers because starting from 8 (which is the first occurrence) up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488.\n   - Number of pages: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Ranges contributing 10 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 ranges).\n   - Range 480-488 contributes 9 8's.\n   - Total 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place up to page N is given by floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, it's floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. Hmm, but when I think about 488, the last units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The first block is 40-49 (pages 40-49), the second is 140-149, third is 240-249, fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does the last block go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 blocks are fully included. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers? Using the same formula: floor((488 + 1)/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 48 times. Alternatively, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different. Wait, when N=488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor((488 + 1)/10) = 48.9, which is 48. But actually, 488 is included, so let's check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me confirm: For units digit, the count is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for N=488, it's floor(489/10)=48. But when N is exactly a multiple of 10, like 480, then floor(481/10)=48, but 480 would be the 48th occurrence. But 488 is not a multiple of 10, so the last 8 in units place is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, perhaps the correct count is 49. Wait, I'm confused. Let me think: The number of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus 1 if the units digit of N is >=8. So, for N=488, the units digit is 8, which is >=8, so we add 1. The number of complete decades is floor(488/10)=48. So, total is 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there up to 488? The first block is 80-89 (pages 80-89), second is 180-189, third is 280-289, fourth is 380-389, and the fifth would be 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 still has 8 in the tens place, right? So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but we're counting the number of times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there? Up to 488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But 480-489 is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is still 8 for all of them. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the fifth block contributes 9 occurrences. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the fifth block, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place: 4 blocks *10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. But wait, when I counted the tens place, I thought it was 49, but let me make sure. So, for tens place, each block of 100 has 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9 because the book ends at 488. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40, and the fifth block is 480-488, which contributes 9. So, 40+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the number of 4's. Units place: from 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? As I thought earlier, it's floor((488+1)/10)=48.9, so 48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49 because 488 is included. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me clarify: The formula is floor((N + 1)/10) for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place. So, for N=488, it's floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so maybe it's 49? Let me list some numbers: 4,14,...,484, which is 484. Then the next would be 494, but 494 is less than 488? No, 494 is greater than 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place for 4 is 48. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. So, total 48+50+89=187. That seems correct. Now, for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4*10=40. The fifth block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences. So, total tens place:40+9=49. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 100 (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 100 (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). There are 4 full blocks contributing 40 occurrences, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many numbers? Similar to the 4's, it's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, starting from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would have 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, the blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

    "text": " Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor division gives 48, but since 484 is within 488, the count is 48 + 1 = 49? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: For units place, the number of 4's is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last page is beyond the last 4 in the units place. Since 488 is less than 490, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, 40-49 is one block, 140-149 is another, up to 440-449. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449. 449 is less than 488, so it's fully included. So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, which is the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, up to 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. So, how many blocks? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, etc.), each contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's five blocks. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, yes, 98 8's. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula is floor(488/10) = 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more if the last partial decade includes a 4. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, the units digit goes up to 8, which doesn't include a 4 in the units place beyond 480. So, it's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is within 480-489, so 484 is included. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yes, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, contributing 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So, how many blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units digit. So, how many terms? Starting at 8, each step +10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only up to 488. So, each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (1st block), 180-189 (2nd), 280-289 (3rd), 380-389 (4th), and 480-488 (partial block). The first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90.

So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and a partial block from 481 to 488. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? In each block of 10, it's once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and the partial block (481-488) has 8 in 488. So, 48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: Does 480-489 fall within 400-488? 480-488 is part of it, but 489 is beyond 488, so only 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9. So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think again. For numbers 1-488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 4 in the units place of 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is in 0-99, 140-149 in 100-199, 240-249 in 200-299, 340-349 in 300-399, and 440-449 in 400-488. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last range, 440-449, go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each with 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, 480-489 is part of the 400-488 range, but 489 is beyond 488, so the range would be 480-488. So, does that affect the count? Wait, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, but if the book only goes up to 488, then in the hundreds place, the 400-488 range includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488) because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, the 8 can appear in 480-488, but that's only 9 numbers, not 10. So, does that mean that in the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 ranges, each with 10, but the last one only has 9? Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is the hundreds place, but for the tens place, the 8 can only be in the tens digit, which is the second digit. So, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 ranges, but actually, it's 5 ranges, with the last one being only 9. So, total 49 in the tens place. Wait, but let me check again. From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that the tens place for 8's was 40, but now I'm getting 49. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the tens place. Let me approach it differently. For the tens place, how many times does 8 appear?\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nFrom 0-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So that's 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought of the hundreds place, I thought 8's don't appear there, which is correct. So, 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, let's compare:\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\n\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. That's 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4, and then 484 is the 49th. So, 49.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. 488 is included, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, plus 488, which is the 49th. So, 49.\n\nTens place: as above, 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would contribute, but it doesn't because the book only goes up to 488. So, 800-899 would have 8's in the hundreds place, but that's beyond 488. So, yes, 0.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, plus an extra 4 in 484. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 4's. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, plus an extra 8 in 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 10 each, plus 9 in 480-488. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within range. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Hmm, maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yeah, that makes sense. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Wait, no, that's the total numbers from 400 to 488. But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block normally has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers; 180-189: 10; 280-289: 10; 380-389:10; 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 +9 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, same for 280-289 and 380-389. Then 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. That would be 48. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? Let's see. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. Continuing this way, the next would be 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The last number is 488, which is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's count the ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and the last range 480-488 contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

From 201 to 300: Another 10 times (204,214,...,294). From 301 to 400: Another 10 times (304,314,...,394). From 401 to 488: Now, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?

For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set would be 440-449, and then 450-488. So let's calculate:\n\n- From 1-100: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n- From 101-200: 140-149: another 10 times.\n- From 201-300: 240-249: another 10 times.\n- From 301-400: 340-349: another 10 times.\n- From 401-488: 440-449: another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, 10 times. So total 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many there are.\n\nFrom 1-100: 8,18,28,...,98: 10 times.\nFrom 101-200: 108,118,...,198: 10 times.\nFrom 201-300: 208,218,...,298: 10 times.\nFrom 301-400: 308,318,...,398: 10 times.\nFrom 401-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included.\n\nSo total units place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488.\n\nSo:\n\n- From 1-100: 80-89: 10 times.\n- From 101-200: 180-189: 10 times.\n- From 201-300: 280-289: 10 times.\n- From 301-400: 380-389: 10 times.\n- From 401-488: 480-488: 9 times (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit is never 8. So 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, so number of 4's is 188 and number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds place doesn't appear at all, so 0. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I counted 49 times, but let me confirm:\n\nFrom 1-100:80-89:10\n101-200:180-189:10\n201-300:280-289:10\n301-400:380-389:10\n401-488:480-488:9\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 50 times, which is:\n\n1-100:40-49:10\n101-200:140-149:10\n201-300:240-249:10\n301-400:340-349:10\n401-488:440-449:10\nTotal:10+10+10+10+10=50\n\nYes, correct.\n\nWait, but in the 400-488 range, 440-449 is within that, so yes, 10 numbers.\n\nSo, yes, 50 times in the tens place for 4's.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). This occurs 50 times in total.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From page 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is '4', which happens 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred, except in the last range where it appears 9 times (480-488). This totals 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as for each hundred, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each hundred has 10 numbers ending with 4, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So total units place 4's would be 40 + 9 = 49. Hmm, but wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so the last number ending with 4 in this range is 484, which is the 9th occurrence. So total units place 4's are 4*10 + 9 = 49. Okay, that seems right.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks would give 5*10=50 numbers. But wait, does the 440-449 block go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This is for numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many? Let's divide 488 by 10: 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but we need to check if 488 is included. Since 488 is the last page, it's included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 numbers where the units digit is 8. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the full blocks first. From 1-488, the full blocks are 80-89 (1st), 180-189 (2nd), 280-289 (3rd), 380-389 (4th). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in this block, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, does the last partial set (481-488) include another 4 in the units place? Yes, 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 481-488, so yes, that's correct. So units place: 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188 fours in total. Wait, let me check that again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8 in 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place: 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many blocks? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40 eights. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but 480-488 is within the book, so that's another block. So actually, 5 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each block except the last one has 10 numbers, but the last one has 9. So, how many eights in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89: 10 eights, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, it's 5 blocks because 480-488 is another block. So, 4 blocks before that with 10 each, and the last one with 9, totaling 4*10 +9=49. So tens place: 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, but let me double-check. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me verify the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems right.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the 48th group, which is 480-489, but our book stops at 488, so does that affect the count? Yes, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the units digit 4 would be at 484, which is within 480-488. So, that's still one occurrence in the 48th group. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, totaling 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (including 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 such ranges, but the last range (480-488) contributes only 9 occurrences. Total tens place 8's = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no 8's in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by dividing N by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this group, so that's one more 4. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, but when I count from 1 to 488, the first 4 is at 4, which is in the first group, and the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is in the 49th group (since 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 minus 6, but maybe I'm complicating it). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, we check each number: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, but 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last group, 481-488, 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count the ranges: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers, since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 eights in the tens place: 4 ranges * 10 = 40. The last range contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total 8's printed: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. Wait, but when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. So that's correct. Similarly, for the 4's, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights, so 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 numbers) contributing 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 eights, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each (40), and the last range contributes 9 eights, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 can be calculated by considering how many complete groups of 10 there are and then adding any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in the incomplete group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is within this range. So, that's one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the incomplete group, 488 is included, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, does 480-489 fall within 488? 488 is within 480-489, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since 488 is the last page, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The ranges where tens digit is 8 are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range with 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49 times. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 9 numbers here. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4*10 +9=49 times. But wait, earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49? That can't be right because 480-488 is only part of the 480-489 range. Let me clarify. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total is 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digit 8 would only be in 4 ranges, but now it's 5 ranges, with the last one being partial. So, the total is 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check the units place. Units place for 8: from 8,18,...,488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the last group, 488 is included, which adds one more. So, 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, as above, it's 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nIn the units place: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, as 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49, as above.\n\nTens place:80-89(10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 4 full ranges and one partial. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, no 8's in hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 40-49, that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149, etc. Up to 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nAnd hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 49th set. So, the 48th set ends at 480, and 481-488 is the 49th set. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once in each set, so 48 times up to 480, and then in 481-488, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating earlier. Alternatively, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. That can be calculated as floor(488/10) + 1 if the units digit is 4 in the last partial set. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, and 48*10 + 4 = 484, which is less than 488, so yes, 484 is included. So, units place 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 occurrences. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89. Now, the tens place: Each time the tens digit is 4, which occurs in 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. So, how many such ranges? From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. For each hundreds digit, the tens digit can be 4, leading to 10 numbers each. So, for hundreds digits 0,1,2,3,4: that's 5 possibilities, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is in the units digit, which is floor(488/10) + (1 if the units digit of 488 is >=4). Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so floor(488/10)=48. Since the remainder is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1 more. So, 48 +1=49. That's correct. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) + (1 if the units digit of 488 is >=8). 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48. Since the units digit is 8, which is >=8, we add 1. So, 48+1=49. So, units place 8's:49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many such ranges? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last page). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 8's, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49. Alternatively, another way to calculate is for each hundreds group, how many times 8 appears in the tens place. From 0-488, the hundreds digits are 0,1,2,3,4. For each hundreds digit, the tens digit can be 8, contributing 10 numbers each. So, for hundreds digits 0,1,2,3: each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 contributes from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. Number of 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Number of 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the tens place, up to 488, we have 49 occurrences. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and we include 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 8 pages into the next ten. So, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's 48 times because 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me see: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's 49 numbers because starting from 4, each step of 10 adds one. So 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, maybe it's 49 times in the units place. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. For the units place, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. Each full ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. But then, in the 489th number, which is beyond our range, so maybe it's just 48 times. Wait, but 484 is within the range, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe the correct way is to calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, which would give 48.9, so 48 times. But 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me list the numbers where 4 appears in the units place: 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Okay, so units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is within the range, but 540-549 would be beyond. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, so 10 times.\n- 140-149: another 10 times.\n- 240-249: another 10 times.\n- 340-349: another 10 times.\n- 440-449: another 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 times. So 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, up to 440-449, which is the fifth set. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's add them up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many times that is.\n\nThe first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488.\n\nLet's count each set:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- 180-189: another 10 times.\n- 280-289: another 10 times.\n- 380-389: another 10 times.\n- 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 times, so 50. But wait, let's confirm:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\nYes, that's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the 488th page is the last page. So, in the units place, the 48th block ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In the 481-488 range, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, up to 488, so the last block is 400-488. So, how many complete hundreds are there? Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 times.\n- 100-199: 140-149 is another block, 10 times.\n- 200-299: 240-249, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n- 400-488: 440-449 is a block, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond that, so that's fine. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 0-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers. 100-199, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, which includes 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so 440-449 is within that. So yes, 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. So, the last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th number. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 times.\n- 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10.\n- 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each block contributes 10 except the last one, which contributes 9. So, 4 blocks with 10 each, and one block with 9.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89: 10\n- 100-199: 180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Because from 80-89, 180-189, etc., each gives 10, and the last block gives 9 because 488 is the last page.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, total 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered that in each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.), the 8's in the tens place occur in a block of 10, except the last one. So, in 0-99:80-89:10 numbers.\n\nIn 100-199:180-189:10.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299:280-289:10.\n\n300-399:380-389:10.\n\n400-488:480-488:9 numbers, since 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: from 8,18,...,488: how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th decade has 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 in units place.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately, but maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, the hundreds place for 4's is from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: from 1-99, how many 4's? Let's see, units place:9 (4,14,...,84), but wait, up to 99, so 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. Wait, that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in units place up to 99. Similarly, tens place:40-49:10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place up to 99. So, total 20 4's up to 99.\n\nSimilarly, from 100-399: each hundred block contributes 20 4's (units and tens). There are 3 such blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 3*20=60 4's.\n\nThen, from 400-488: hundreds place contributes 89 4's, and in the tens and units places, how many?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens place: 40-49 in each hundred, but since we're only going up to 488, let's see:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0, so no 4's in tens place.\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, no.\n- 420-429: tens digit 2, no.\n- 430-439: tens digit 3, no.\n- 440-449: tens digit 4, so 10 numbers, 10 4's.\n- 450-459: tens digit 5, no.\n- 460-469: tens digit 6, no.\n- 470-479: tens digit7, no.\n- 480-488: tens digit8, so 9 numbers, but 8's in tens place, which we've already counted.\n\nSo, in 400-488, the tens place contributes only 10 4's (from 440-449).\n\nSimilarly, units place in 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nSo, in 400-488, units place:9, tens place:10, hundreds place:89.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488:9+10+89=108.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 49+50+89=188. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try adding up.\n\nWait, perhaps my initial approach was correct, but let me see:\n\nWait, from 1-99: 20 4's (10 in units, 10 in tens).\n\nFrom 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 20 4's, so 60.\n\nFrom 400-488: 89 in hundreds, plus 10 in tens (440-449), plus 9 in units (404,414,...484). So, 89+10+9=108.\n\nSo total 4's:20+60+108=188. That matches my initial count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nFrom 1-99: units place:10 (8,18,...,98), tens place:10 (80-89). So, 20 8's.\n\nFrom 100-399: each hundred contributes 20 8's (10 in units, 10 in tens). So, 3 hundreds, 60.\n\nFrom 400-488: units place:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88, which is 10 numbers up to 488. Wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 10th occurrence. Wait, no: 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, units place in 400-488: 8,18,...,488. How many? From 400-488, the units digits cycle 0-9 every 10 pages. So, how many times does 8 appear in units place? Let's see: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 408 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 9 times in units place.\n\nIn the tens place: 480-488: the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in tens place.\n\nSo, from 400-488: units place 9, tens place 9, hundreds place 0. So, 18 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's:20 (from 1-99) +60 (from 100-399) +18 (from 400-488)=98.\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nSo, number of 4's:188, number of 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 90 seemed high, but after checking, it seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think: For each digit position, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think of it as how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades. In each decade, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, does the 48th decade end at 480, so 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the 48th decade, 484 is the 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. But 488's units digit is 8, not 4, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: The first range is 40-49, which is the first set. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would be up to 449, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (1 range). From 100-199: 140-149 (1 range). From 200-299: 240-249 (1 range). From 300-399: 340-349 (1 range). From 400-488: 440-449 (1 range). So that's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, in the 400-488 range, does 440-449 exist? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 (1 range), 180-189 (1), 280-289 (1), 380-389 (1), and 480-488 (1). Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so in this case, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, but the range is only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how does that affect the count? Let me check: For 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total ranges: 5, but the last one has 9 instead of 10. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is equal to how many complete hundreds there are, each contributing a 10-number range, plus any partial range. So, from 1-488, how many times does the tens digit cycle through 0-9? It's 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears once per ten numbers, so 10 times per hundred. So, 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 4 full ranges (40 each) and a partial range (9), totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The formula is (last occurrence - first occurrence)/interval + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Let's see how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets? From 40-49: 1 set. Then each hundred has another set: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets in total. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 count as a full set? Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within the range, so yes, it's a full set. So, 5 sets * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. Let's count how many sets: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many full sets? 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40 8's in the tens place. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 4 full sets and 9 additional, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the 49th group, which is 481-490, but the book only goes up to 488. So in the 481-488 range, the units digit 4 appears at 484. So that's one more 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Maybe I should approach it differently. For the units digit, the number of 4's from 1 to N can be calculated by floor division. So, for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nNow, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears at 488. So that's one more. So total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. But the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So each of these ranges contributes 10 fours except the last one, which contributes 9. Let me check:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers (tens digit 8)\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 hundreds place 8's.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, +89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 +49 =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place 8's.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\nTotal:5*10=50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488:89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: from 4,14,...,484:49 numbers.\n\n8's: from 8,18,...,488:49 numbers.\n\nSo yes, the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90. So 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   - There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours.  \n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 adds 1 more.  \n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, except 440-449, which is fully within 488.  \n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   - 48 full groups contribute 48 eights.  \n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 adds 1 more.  \n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 eights each, and 480-488 contributes 9.  \n   - Total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, how many 4's in the units place? Let's think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so after 480, we have 481-488. In this last partial group, 484 is included, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's. Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 exist? 480-489 would be another block, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of this block. How many 8's in the tens place here? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481, 482,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, the block 480-488 contributes 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 + 9=49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is the fifth block if we count from 80-89 as the first. Wait, let me think again. The blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 5 blocks, with the last one contributing 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - From 1 to 480: 48 occurrences.  \n   - From 481 to 488: 1 occurrence (484).  \n   - **Total units place 4's:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   - There are 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).  \n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - From 1 to 488: 49 occurrences.  \n   - **Total units place 8's:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Full blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 (4 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences).  \n   - Partial block: 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences (480-488).  \n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within that range. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think again. The numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. To find the count, I can take (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, all numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 x 10 = 40 times. But wait, 480-489 is another range where the tens digit is 8, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's an extra 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399: 380-389:10. Then, 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So total tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times.

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division would give 48, but since 484 is within the range, it's actually 49 times. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. But each group contributes one 4 in the units place. However, in the last partial group (480-488), there's a 4 in 484. So, that's one more 4. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488, which includes 484. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But in the last group, 480-488, there's 488, which is an 8 in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? 480-489 is beyond 488, so the last range is 380-389. So, how many ranges? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +40 +0=89. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 -89=99. Wait, that's a lot. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check the counts again. For 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. Total 89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. For 8's: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Hundreds place: none. So total 89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389 \u2192 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48 full groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), so 48 times, but then we have an extra 4 in 484. So that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are within 1-488.\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, yes. So total 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Because when counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. Then, the tens place: each hundred has a 40-49, so 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. Then, units place: every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 times. So, 89+50+49=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488.\n\nHow many terms? Let's see: The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four ranges have 10 each, and the last one has 9. So total in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, yes. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 4's. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. How many terms? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,28,...,488. As calculated, 49 numbers.\n\nTens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. First four sets have 10 each, last set has 9, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, 8's total 98.\n\nThus, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 480 is the first, 488 is the last, so 488-480+1=9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nI think that's accurate. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are, plus any extra. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (484) = 49. Hmm, I think that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens place is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 10 numbers are included.

Hmm, that seems correct. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: yes, 180-189: yes, 280-289: yes, 380-389: yes. So, 4 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 40 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 89. So, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:40, hundreds:0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Yes, that seems correct. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 4's.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 8's.\n   - The last partial group includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 such blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - Each block contributes 10 8's.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **89**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = **99**.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{99}."

    "text": " Wait, actually, page 1 is page 1, so starting from 4, every 10 pages. So from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each set. - 40-49: that's 10 numbers. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 times in the hundreds place. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many sets:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). \n\nSo total in tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, so 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. So 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. I said from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none, so 0. So 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Let me think again. For each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48. But wait, in the last partial set from 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. Alternatively, the formula for the number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit of N is >= the digit. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit cycles through 0-9. Each cycle of 10 numbers contributes one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. Since 4 is within that range (484), we have one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers, specifically in the 40-49 range, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks exist up to 488.\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so all these blocks are present. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's go through it again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, numbers 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for all these, so how many 8's in the tens place here? Each number from 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place, so 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but earlier blocks have 10 each, and this one has 9. So total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. Specifically, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 occurrences. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I got 188. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50)\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 4 blocks of 10, and one block of 9, so 4*10 +9=49)\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, hundreds place is 0, correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's using a formula or another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit position separately, but I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but let me consider that in the tens place for 4's, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the units place for 4's, I included 484, which is correct. But for 8's, I included 488, which is correct as well.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula where for each digit position, the count is determined by higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut I think my initial method is correct, so I'll stick with the difference being 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by considering each hundred. For example, in 1-100, 4 appears 10 times in the units place (4,14,24,...,94). Similarly, in 101-200, another 10 times, and so on. Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the units place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, how many 4's in the units place? The numbers would be 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 more. So total 4's in units place: 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5*10=50. But wait, in the 440-449 block, the tens digit is 4, but the units digit can be from 0-9, so that's correct. So 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? This happens from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many. From 1-488, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, each of these numbers has 8 in the tens digit, so that's 9 more. So total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently.

That gives 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last complete set is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48. Wait, but when n=488, the units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,...,484, which is 484 being the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so 48+1=49. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me list some numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.

Okay, so units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers where the tens digit is 4. These are from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total blocks: 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. These occur in blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each block except the last contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, total: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 at maximum. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the highest page is 488. Occurrences: 0.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, for each group of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 4, 14, ..., 484 is 49 numbers. So, maybe it's 49. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as follows: For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 10 - d) / 10). But maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, since 488 is the upper limit, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of complete cycles is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But then, in the incomplete cycle (the last 8 numbers: 481-488), we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, etc. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149, third is 240-249, fourth is 340-349, and the fifth would be 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. So, total 4's in the hundreds place is 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count how many full blocks and the partial block. The first block is 80-89: 10 numbers. The second is 180-189: 10. Third is 280-289: 10. Fourth is 380-389: 10. Fifth is 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total blocks: 5, but the last one has 9 instead of 10. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is (4 blocks x 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let me test this. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is given by floor((N + 1)/10). So, for 488, it would be floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place for 4's. Wait, but when I list them, 4,14,...,484, that's 484 - 4 divided by 10 plus 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Hmm, so maybe I was right the first time. Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's consider each page number from 1 to 488. For the units digit, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, so 480 / 10 = 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So total 48 times in the units place. Okay, so 48 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. That would be numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? Let's see, from 1 to 488, the last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, using the same method as before, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48. But wait, let's check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so is it 49 times? But earlier for 4's, I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me confirm. For 4's in the units place, up to 488, the last 4 in units is 484, which is the 48th occurrence because (484 -4)/10 +1 = 48. So, 48 times. For 8's, the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th term because (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, first four blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the tens place, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 except the last which contributes 9. So 4*10 +9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nLet me recount the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: from 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the initial calculation for 4's, I thought units place was 48 because 488 is the last page, but 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 48th 4 in the units place because 4,14,24,...,484 is 48 terms. Wait, but 484 is the 48th term because 4 is the first, then every 10 pages. So, 4 +10*(n-1)=484, so n-1=(484-4)/10=48, so n=49. Wait, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think that the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor((N +1)/10). So, for 4's in units place up to 488, it's floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48. So, 48 times. But when I list them, 4,14,24,...,484, that's 484/10=48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is the 48th term because starting at 4, each step is +10. So, 4 is the first, 14 the second, up to 484 being the 48th. So, 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, up to 488, the last is 488, which is the 49th term because 8,18,...,488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=49.\n\nSo, 4's in units:48, 8's in units:49.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 48 4's in units, but 49 8's in units. So, that's a difference of 1. But in the tens place, 4's had 50, 8's had 49. In hundreds place, 4's had 89, 8's had 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the tens place for 4's. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place, it's 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, first four blocks are 10 each, last block is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about units place for 4's, I thought it was 48, but when I listed them, it seemed like 49. Let me confirm with an example. Let's take a smaller number, say up to 50.\n\nIf I have page numbers up to 50, how many 4's in units place? 4,14,24,34,44. That's 5 numbers, which is floor((50 +1)/10)=5. So, 5 times. So, if N=50, units digit 4 appears 5 times.\n\nSimilarly, for N=488, units digit 4 appears floor((488 +1)/10)=48 times. So, 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place up to 488, floor((488 +1)/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times because 488 is the 49th occurrence.\n\nWait, no, floor((488 +1)/10)=48.9, which floors to 48. But 488 is the 49th 8 in units place because 8,18,...,488 is 49 terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is floor((N)/10) if we're not including N+1. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus 1 if the units digit of N is >= d.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it as (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nWait, actually, for the units digit, the number of times d appears is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is N // 10, plus 1 if the units digit of N is >= d.\n\nWait, for example, N=488, d=4.\n\nN//10=48.8, but in integer division, it's 48. Then, since 488%10=8 >=4, so total is 48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, but when I list them, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. Wait, 484 is 484, which is 484//10=48.4, so 48 times. But 488 is the last page, so 488//10=48, and since 8 >=4, we add 1, making it 49. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have an 8 in the units place, which is after 484. So, 488 would be the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place, but 4's in units place would stop at 484, which is 48 times.\n\nWait, so for 4's in units place up to 488, it's 48 times because 484 is the last 4 in units place, and 488 doesn't have a 4 in units place. So, the formula would be floor((N - d)/10) +1 if the units digit of N is >= d. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me use the formula correctly. The number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to:\n\nnumber = N // 10\n\nif N % 10 >= d, then number +=1\n\nBut only if d !=0.\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488.\n\nnumber = 488 //10 =48\n\nsince 488%10=8 >=4, number +=1 \u2192 49.\n\nWait, but that would suggest 49 times, but when I list them, it's 4,14,...,484, which is 48 numbers because 484 is 48th term. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is not correct when d=0. Let me check another example.\n\nIf N=50, d=4.\n\nnumber =50//10=5\n\n50%10=0 <4, so no addition.\n\nSo, 5 times, which is correct: 4,14,24,34,44.\n\nSimilarly, for N=484, d=4.\n\nnumber=484//10=48\n\n484%10=4 >=4, so number +=1 \u219249.\n\nBut 484 is the 48th term because starting at 4, each +10, so 4,14,...,484 is 48 terms.\n\nWait, so perhaps the formula is giving 49, but actual count is 48. So, maybe the formula is incorrect when d=4 and N=484.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct when N is such that the units digit is >=d, but in reality, when N is exactly a multiple of 10 plus d, then it's included.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, 484//10=48.4, which is 48 in integer division.\n\n484%10=4, which is equal to d=4, so add 1, total 49.\n\nBut when I list them, 4,14,...,484, that's 48 terms because 4 +10*(n-1)=484 \u2192 n-1=(484-4)/10=48 \u2192n=49. So, 49 terms. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. So, my initial thought was wrong.\n\nSo, in the case of 4's in units place up to 488, the count is 49, not 48.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, but 484 is the last 4 in units place.\n\nWait, so up to 484, it's 49 times, and from 485 to 488, there are no more 4's in units place.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's in units place is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place up to 488, it's 49 times because 488 is included.\n\nWait, so that changes things. So, I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 4's in units place were 48. It's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, let's recalculate the total number of 4's.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 187. So, that's a difference of 1.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting counts now. Let me make sure.\n\nWait, let's take a smaller example to test the formula.\n\nSuppose N=50.\n\nHow many 4's in units place? 4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 times.\n\nUsing the formula:50//10=5, 50%10=0<4, so total=5. Correct.\n\nAnother example: N=48.\n\n48//10=4, 48%10=8>=4, so total=4+1=5.\n\nBut 4,14,24,34,44 \u21925 numbers, correct.\n\nAnother example: N=44.\n\n44//10=4, 44%10=4>=4, so total=4+1=5.\n\nWhich is correct:4,14,24,34,44.\n\nSimilarly, N=45.\n\n45//10=4, 45%10=5>=4, so total=4+1=5.\n\nWhich is correct:4,14,24,34,44.\n\nNow, N=484.\n\n484//10=48, 484%10=4>=4, so total=48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times, which would be 4,14,...,484.\n\nSo, 49 terms.\n\nSimilarly, N=488.\n\n488//10=48, 488%10=8>=4, so total=48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSo, in the case of 4's in units place up to 488, it's 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place up to 488, it's 49 times.\n\nSo, earlier, I thought 4's in units place were 48, but actually, it's 49.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the total number of 4's.\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place:50 times.\n\nUnits place:49 times.\n\nTotal:188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, for 8's in the tens place, the blocks are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40.\n\nThe last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, total in tens place for 8's is 40+9=49.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98.\n\nSimilarly, 4's:\n\n49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: total 188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89. So, I must have miscalculated somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the 4's in the tens place again.\n\nTens digit is 4: numbers from 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449.\n\nEach block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times.\n\nSo, 50 is correct.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:98.\n\nSo, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me confirm.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers:4,14,24,...,484,494? Wait, no, 494 is beyond 488. So, the last 4 in units place is 484.\n\nSo, how many terms?\n\nStarting at 4, each +10:4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe nth term is 4 +10*(n-1)=484.\n\nSo, 10*(n-1)=480 \u2192n-1=48 \u2192n=49.\n\nSo, 49 terms.\n\nSo, units place:49.\n\nSo, total 4's:188.\n\n8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but I'm now confident that the answer is 90. But earlier I thought it was 89. I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, inclusive.\n\n488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer was 89 earlier, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d and number N, the count of d in the units place is:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max( (N % 100) - (d * 10) + 1, 0 ), 10)\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\ncount_hundreds = (N // 1000) * 100 + min(max( (N % 1000) - (d * 100) + 1, 0 ), 100)\n\nBut maybe that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for each digit position.\n\nFor units place:\n\ncount_units = (N + 10 - d) // 10\n\nBut only if d !=0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds):\n\n    higher = N // (position * 10)\n    current = (N // position) % 10\n    lower = N % position\n\n    if current > d:\n        count += (higher + 1) * position\n    elif current == d:\n        count += higher * position + lower + 1\n    else:\n        count += higher * position\n\nBut this is more accurate.\n\nLet me apply this for d=4 and N=488.\n\nFirst, for units place (position=1):\n\nhigher = 488 // (1*10)=48\ncurrent = (488 //1) %10=8\nlower=488%1=0\n\nSince current=8>4, count += (48+1)*1=49*1=49.\n\nTens place (position=10):\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8>4, count += (4+1)*10=5*10=50. So, total so far 49+50=99.\n\nHundreds place (position=100):\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\nSince current=4==4, count += higher*100 + lower +1=0*100 +88 +1=89. So, total count=99+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=0\n\nSince current=8==8, count += (48)*1 +0 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=8\nlower=8\n\nSince current=8==8, count +=4*10 +8 +1=40+8+1=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=4\nlower=88\n\nSince current=4<8, count +=0*100=0.\n\nTotal count=49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference=188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem statement, the book has 488 pages, so page numbers from 1 to 488. So, the correct count is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 numbers. Total is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think again. If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last page, the last units place with a 4 is 484, which is the 48th ten plus the 4 in 484. So maybe it's 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the units place 4's go up to 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So that's 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more in 484, making it 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last digit is 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division gives 48, and since 488's units digit is 8, not 4, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 48*10 + 4 is 484, which is the 48th occurrence, because 4 is the first, then 14 is the second, up to 484 being the 48th. Wait, no, actually, 4 is the first, 14 the second, ..., 484 is the (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49th. So yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such decades are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 488. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188. So total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488).\n\nSo that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So total 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place can only be 8 if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last being 480-488 (9 times) \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the digit is less than the units digit of N, but if it's equal, then it's (N // 10) + 1. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. For the units place, every 10 numbers have exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place would be at 484. So, from 1 to 484, that's 484 numbers. 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 can appear in the tens digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, we also have the 400-488 range. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in each hundred. But since 488 is less than 500, the tens digit from 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s. So, that's another 10 numbers: 400-409. Wait, but 488 is beyond 409, so actually, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the 400s, which is 10 numbers (400-409). So, total tens place fours: 4*10 (from 0-399) plus 10 (from 400-488) = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400s, which is the 5th hundred. So, in 0-399, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 400-409. So, total tens place fours: 40 +10=50. Wait, but 488 is beyond 409, so the tens digit beyond 409 would be 1, 2, ..., 8, but the tens digit is 4 only up to 409. So, yes, 10 numbers. So, total tens place fours: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total fours: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights in the units place. But wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 488//10=48, but since 488 is included, we have 48+1=49 eights in the units place. Wait, let me check: numbers ending with 8 up to 488 are 8,18,28,...,488. The number of such numbers is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens digit being 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block of 100 contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Therefore, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49=98. But let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. Hundreds place: 0. So, total eights: 98. Now, the number of fours is 187, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. So, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that the digit 4 appears 187 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives the difference.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the 48th set would end at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. In 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 count as another 8? Yes, because 488 is included. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but only for 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many 8's in the tens place? 4 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 more 8's in the tens place (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
