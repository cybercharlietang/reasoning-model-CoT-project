    "text": " So, that's 48 intervals of 10, but including both ends, so 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let's compute that: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 1 block, 100-199: 1, 200-299: 1, 300-399: 1, 400-488: 1. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. Using the formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks exist within 488. From 1-99: 80-89 is 1 block. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. So, that's 4 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Wait, but let me check if 380-389 is within 488. Yes, 389 is less than 488, so that's valid. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49 + 40 = 89. 188 - 89 = 99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. There are 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. There are 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since page numbers don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 40 = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but wait: 488 is the last page. So, from 0 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so that's 4 ranges. So, 4*10=40 times. But wait, does 480-489 also count? Wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but only 9 numbers, not 10. So, how does that affect the count? Wait, earlier I thought of 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which are 4 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 40. But then 480-488 adds 9 more numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. But wait, when counting the tens place, I included 480-488, which adds 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. So, 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488, which is the 8th digit in the units place of 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 0-488 includes 49 sets of 10. Wait, no, because 488 is the last number, so from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let me think: The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are up to 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place (480,481,...,488). So, I think I made a mistake earlier. I should check if the hundreds digit is 4, so 480-488 is within the 400-488 range. So, in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, the first four ranges are complete (each 10 numbers), and the last one is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 8's in the tens place. I thought that in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 8's. 4's: 188. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me check the 4's again. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 =484. So, (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place:49. Tens place:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Hundreds place:400-488. How many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. That seems correct. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and hundreds places, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me try another approach to verify. Alternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit for each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- 4's: every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full decades, each contributing 1 four, and then in the last partial decade, 488%10=8, so from 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, which includes a 4 (484). So, 48*1 +1=49.\n\n- 8's: similarly, every 10 numbers, 488//10=48 full decades, each contributing 1 eight, and the last partial decade includes 8 (488), so 48*1 +1=49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- 4's: every 100 numbers, there are 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 488//100=4 full centuries, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4*10 +10=50.\n\n- 8's: every 100 numbers, 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\n- 8's: no numbers, as 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units place 4's go up to 484, which is 48 times? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is floor(488/10) = 48 times. But wait, 488 is 488, so 488 is the 48th decade? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full decades, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no. Let me list some: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10. From 200-299: 240-249: 10. From 300-399: 340-349: 10. From 400-488: 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, total ranges: 5, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 *10 =50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 -400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Numbers ending with 8 from 1 to 488. These are 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Numbers where the tens digit is 8. These are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total:10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 -98=90.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I was wrong before. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place would be 49. Let me verify: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the 49th ten, which is 480-488, the 484 is included. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing an 8 in the units place, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: Does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is within 480-489. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has another 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 100-199: 140-149 is 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's 10 numbers. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're counting whole numbers, we take 48 full decades. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 8 in the units place. From 0-480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8. Then, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, no, 488 is within the 480-489 range, which is the 49th set. So, actually, it's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is the same as the number of times 4 does, right? Because it's every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th decade starts at 480, but only goes up to 488, which includes 488. So, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, but when I did the 4's, I had 49 in the units place. So, maybe it's 49 for 8's as well. Let me verify: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8 (1st), the last is 488 (49th). So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count these. From 80-89: 10 numbers. From 180-189: another 10. From 280-289: another 10. From 380-389: another 10. From 480-488: that's 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n  \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, contributing 10. Similarly, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many ranges? 0-99: 1 range, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. Wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total ranges: 5. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 400-488, but we're only considering 440-449, which is within that. So, yes, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488: would there be a 480-489? But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of this. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of these. So, how does this affect the count? Let me think. Normally, each range like 80-89 has 10 numbers, but in the 400s, 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? From 0-399: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 more. So, total in tens place: 40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, in the units place, there are 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, in the range 40-49, every number has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many numbers there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. Taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Let's count how many full blocks there are: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. Total 188. For the 8's: units: 49, tens: 49. Total 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. That's correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks with 10 and 1 with 9: 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: Units place (49) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, how many numbers? Let's see: The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The sequence starts at 8 (which is 8 + 0*10) and ends at 488 (8 + 48*10). So, the number of terms is 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488) because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, right? Because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10th number. So, the last one would be 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, starting from 0 (if we include 0, which isn't a page number), but since we start at 1, the first occurrence is at 4, which is the 1st, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on up to 484, which is the 49th. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each hundred have a 4 in the tens place. For each hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, the 4 in the tens place occurs 10 times (e.g., 40-49). How many complete hundreds are there? Up to 400-488. So, from 0-99: 10 numbers (40-49). From 100-199: 10 numbers (140-149). From 200-299: 10 numbers (240-249). From 300-399: 10 numbers (340-349). From 400-488: Now, the tens digit is 4, so the numbers are 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. However, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 449 is included, and 450 onwards up to 488 doesn't affect the tens place for 4. So, that's 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 (for 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times. Wait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit can be 4, but the units digit can go up to 88. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each: - 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 is 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 is 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 is 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10 (0-99) +10 (100-199)+10 (200-299)+10 (300-399)+9 (400-488) = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488.\n   - This results in 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This results in 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 starting from page 400 to 499, but since our book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Let's see: from 400 to 488, inclusive. The number of pages here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. But wait, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so that's included. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each have 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers.

So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " So, units place gives us 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each range. Each range has 10 numbers, but wait, the last range is 440-449, but our book goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. To find how many, I can do 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, 488 is included, so let's see: from 0 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th occurrence (8, 18, ..., 488). So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each range before that (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. So, let's count how many ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last one, 480-488, has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48 full decades, which gives 48 times, but since 484 is included, that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete sets of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the 48th set ends at 480, and then from 481 to 488, there's another 4 at 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which contributes 9 8's (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 8's, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 8's. So, total in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, totaling 50 times. However, I should check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me think again. When I'm counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. But when I'm counting the tens and units places, I have to make sure I'm not double-counting numbers where 4 appears in multiple places. Wait, no, because in the units and tens counts, I'm only counting the specific digit place, so a number like 444 would have been counted once in units, once in tens, and once in hundreds, which is correct because it has three 4's. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus the 8 in 488. Wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 0-488, the units 8's are at 8, 18, ..., 488. So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, that's 4 full decades (each contributing 10) and one partial decade with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8 in each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me recount the 4's: units place: from 4,14,...,484. So, 484 is the 49th number because 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th occurrence. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm overcounting somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none, so that's correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th. Correct. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is the 49th. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 49. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, that's 49 times in the units place. Wait, but since the book starts at page 1, page 0 doesn't exist, so maybe it's 48 times? Hmm, let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1-10: 4 is once. 11-20: 14 is once. Similarly, each 10-number block contributes one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of units place 4's is the number of complete 10s in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, that would be 48 times in the units place. Wait, but when I count from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is indeed 48. Because 488 / 10 = 48.8, but we only count up to 488, so 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many full ranges there are. The last range is 440-449, which is entirely within 488. So, that's 5 ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449. Since 449 is less than 488, it's fully included. So, yes, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but I'm only supposed to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me add that again: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similarly, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is 49, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. From 1-10: 8 is once. 11-20: 18 is once. ... 481-490: 488 is once. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one more in the 488th page. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears 49 times. Wait, let me count: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yes, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many full ranges are there? The first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) are complete, each contributing 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Wait, so 49 in units, 49 in tens, so 98 total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 -98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, +89=187. Yes. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. But let me just make sure I didn't overcount or undercount in any digit place. For 4's in the units place: from 4,14,...,484. That's 484=4+10*(n-1), so n=(484-4)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now this formula suggests 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48 because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles. But using the formula, it's 49. Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me clarify. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit is 4 from 1 to 488. So, starting at 4, every 10 numbers. So, the first occurrence is at 4, then 14, 24,..., up to 484. So, how many terms are there? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 +10(n-1)=484. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but using the formula, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. That changes things. So, I need to correct that. So, let's redo the count for 4's. Units place: 49. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Wait, 49+50=99, +89=188. Now, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, total 8's=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. Wait, so now I get 90. But earlier I thought it was 89, but that was because I had 4's as 187. So, I must have made a mistake in the units place count for 4's. Let me double-check. So, units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48 as I initially thought. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. 8's: 49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 89 because I had 187-98=89, but that was due to an error in counting the units place for 4's. So, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just make sure about the tens place for 4's. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. That seems correct. And hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, yes, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which when floored gives 48, but since 484 is within the range, it's actually 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. From 1 to 488, how many full decades are there? 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would be in 400-488, right? So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, the tens place contributes 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place. Then, 488 itself is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The last block is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last one is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but 488 is included. So, from 0-488, how many numbers? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 appears in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is included. So, how many ranges? 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each, and one range with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. 8 is not in the hundreds place because 800 would be beyond 488. So, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only considering up to 484 in the units place, it's 48 full decades (0-10, 10-20, ..., 480-490) but since 490 is beyond 488, we have 48 times. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + 1 if the digit is in the units place of N. But N is 488. So, for the digit 4 in units place, how many times does it occur? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 440-449, which is less than 488, so that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have a 4 in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place, starting at 8. So, 488//10=48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many ranges there are. From 1-488, the ranges where the tens digit is 8 are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -98=89. Wait, that's 89 more 4's than 8's. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units:48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total:187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's printed is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, we have 4 full ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) and a partial range starting at 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 full ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, divide 488 by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page, so that's the 49th occurrence because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers.

How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). 4*10=40. Now, does 480-489 fall within 488? Yes, up to 488. So, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, that's an additional 9. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.

From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges with 10 numbers each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range with 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the units and tens places for 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is 49 occurrences (from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - This is 89 occurrences (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is 49 occurrences (from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = **49** occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full decades, but each decade has one 4 in the units place. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take the floor, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 in 488. So, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The first is 4 (4), then 14 (14), 24 (24), ..., 484. So, how many terms are there? The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds and 88. So, there are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But wait, the first hundred (0-99) includes 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. However, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges are there up to 488. Each hundred has one such range. So, 0-99:80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488: does 480-489 fall within 400-488? 480-489 is from 480 to 489, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, total 10+10+10+10+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. For the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, total 8's:98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 terms, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range includes 89 terms.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This contributes 49 terms.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, let me confirm: starting at 8, which is the first, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count the ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place of 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges? 0-99:1, 100-199:1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, and 400-488: part of it. So, that's 4 full ranges (each contributing 10) and 1 partial range contributing 9. So, total tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484 for the units place, it's 48 times, but actually, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, it's 0-9, 10-19, etc., so 484 is the 48th set plus the 4th number in the next set. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is given by (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are. From 1 to 488, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups). In each group, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the last group, which is 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included. So actually, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, meaning that in the last group, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, in the 400-488 range, does 440-449 fully fit? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187 times. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 0-9, 10-19,...,480-489. So, up to 488, it's 48 full groups (each contributing one 8) plus the 8 in 488, which is the 49th. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears once in each group. Let's calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10 = 489 // 10 = 48.9, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe a better way: the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. The formula is floor((488 + 1) / 10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I'm confused. Let me think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete decades are there? 48 complete decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490). Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the last decade is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in each decade, the units digit 8 appears once. So, 48 decades would give 48 times. But wait, the first decade is 1-10, which includes 8 as the 8th number. So, yes, 48 times. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these ranges. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count the ranges: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total numbers where 8 is in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49 times. But let me double-check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So yes, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, tens place:49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place:0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97 times. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the tens place was 49, but let me check again. Wait, in the tens place, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 times. So total 8's:48+49=97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place:48, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place:48, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so that's 49 times. But earlier, I thought it was 48. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake there. Let me recalculate the units place for 8's. The formula is: number of times = floor((N + 1) / 10) if the last digit is >=8. Wait, N=488. So, (488 +1)/10=489/10=48.9, so floor is 48. But wait, when N=488, the units digit is 8, so it should be counted as well. So, perhaps the correct formula is floor((N)/10) +1 if the units digit >= the target digit. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as the number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, then every 10 numbers. So, the sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). The last term is 488, so 8 +10(n-1)=488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. So, earlier, I thought it was 48, but it's actually 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Therefore, the units place for 8's is 49, not 48. So, correcting that, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but earlier, I thought the tens place was 49. Let me confirm. For the tens place, as before, we have 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49. Units place:49. So total 8's:49+49=98. Now, number of 4's:187, number of 8's:98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, so earlier I thought 8's were 97, but now it's 98. Let me check again. If units place for 8's is 49, and tens place is 49, then total 8's=98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. But let me make sure about the units place for 8's. Let me list some numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So yes, 49 times. Therefore, the correct count for 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 4's=187, 8's=98, difference=187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90. Let me check the 4's again. Units place:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That's correct. So, 187-98=89. So, the correct answer should be 89. But wait, I'm getting confused because earlier I thought units place for 8's was 48, but it's actually 49. So, the correct total for 8's is 98, making the difference 89. So, I think the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, each contributing one 4 in the units place.\n   - Total: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - There are 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive).\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187 times**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - There are 49 such numbers (including 488).\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = **49 times**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (that's 10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, which is 50 numbers. However, I need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 sets are valid. Therefore, there are 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let's see: starting from 0, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, from 0 to 488, that's 489 numbers (since 488 + 1 = 489), but we're only considering up to 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, which gives 48 occurrences, and then the 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. That's 4 sets of 10, so 40 numbers. But wait, does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, no 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. Wait, that seems too high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:40. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 99 seems like a big difference. Let me check again. Units place for 4: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The formula is (last - first)/step +1. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 sets, 40 numbers. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Therefore, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which suggests 48 full decades, but since 484 is within the range, it's 49 times. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1)/10). So, for 488, floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. Hmm, but when I count from 4 to 484, that's 48 intervals of 10, but the first one starts at 4, so maybe it's 48 times. Wait, let me list some numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. I think my initial calculation was wrong because floor((488 + 1)/10) gives 48, but actually, it's 49. So, units place for 4: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. The last block ends at 449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, tens place for 4: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place for 4: 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's go through each place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me calculate how many times. Using the same method as before, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Alternatively, floor((488 + 1)/10) = 48.8, which is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, units place for 8: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens digit in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 4*10=40 times. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 times. So, total tens place for 8: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place for 8: 0 times. Adding up all occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, starting from 8, each 10 numbers. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, how many? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, contributing 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For the 8's: Units:49, Tens:49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct. Units place: same as 4's, 49. So, 98 total. So, the difference is 90. But wait, I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again. From page 400 to 488, inclusive, how many pages? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98.

So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from 4,14,...,484). Wait, but 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, I'm confused. Let me think differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. The pattern repeats every 10 numbers: 0-9, 10-19, ..., 480-489. Each group of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. So, 48 4's in the units place. But wait, the last group is 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so the 480-488 range includes 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So, that's the 49th occurrence. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Hmm, I think I need to verify this. Let me list some: 4,14,24,...,484. The first is 4, and the last is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, yes, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 1 to 488. The ranges are: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Now, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many ranges are there? Let's count: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d710 numbers each =50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5\u00d710=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 =89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let's add them up: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Now, let me check if I did that correctly. Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each complete range (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, how many complete ranges? 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). Each contributes 10 8's: 4\u00d710=40. Plus the last range, 480-488, which has 9 8's. So, total 40+9=49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. This would be in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, resulting in 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, in the units place, there are 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, the last block is 440-449, but since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is still within the range. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (2nd block), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. That's 5 * 10 = 50 4's. But wait, does 440-449 actually have 10 numbers? Yes, because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 8 appears in the units place at 488. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block normally has 10 numbers, but the last block only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers (480-488). Let's count the blocks: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, units place contributes 48 times? Wait, no, because from 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 480-488, which includes 484 as the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. For each page number from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is the units digit, which is every 10 numbers. So, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let's see: The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms can be found by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488. The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149, third 240-249, fourth 340-349, and fifth 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, each block contributes 10 occurrences. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 have 10 numbers? Yes, from 440 to 449, inclusive, that's 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks *10=50. So, tens place contributes 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of 4. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +50 +89= 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of 4. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, but let's see. The 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place contributes 49 occurrences of 8. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The first block is 80-89, second 180-189, third 280-289, fourth 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be the next block, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, the first three blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289) each have 10 numbers, contributing 3*10=30. The last block is 380-389, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. Wait, but 480-488 is the next block, but that's only 9 numbers, so does that count? Wait, no, because 480-489 would be the next block, but since we only go up to 488, the 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but for the tens place, 8 in the tens place would be 480-489, but since we only have up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480 has a tens digit of 8, 481 has it, up to 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, the blocks are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is part of the hundreds place, but actually, in the tens place, it's the tens digit that matters. So, 480-488 have 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's:4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. So, tens place contributes 49 occurrences of 8. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would occur in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences of 8. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds=49+49+0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d710 =50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u219289 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 +50 +89 =188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:**8,18,28,...,488 \u219249 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:**80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488 \u21924 blocks \u00d710 +9=49.\n- **Hundreds place:**No occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:**49 +49=98.\n\n**Difference:**188 -98=90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, but since 484 is within the range, it's 49 times. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 times, but we also need to check if 484 is within the range. Yes, 484 is less than 488, so that's 48 times plus one more for 484? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But since the remainder is 8, which is less than 10, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 488 limit. So, that's 49 times? Wait, no. Because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the 49th occurrence would be at 490, which is beyond 488, so actually, it's 48 times. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list a few to check. From 1-10: 4 appears once. 11-20: once. 21-30: once. So, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, how many such 10s are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full 10s, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Again, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, let's check the last number: 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number where 8 is in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each with one 8, so 48 times, plus one more for 488, making it 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last number, so does that count as an additional occurrence? Let me think: the first 8 in units is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. How many numbers is that? The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many full ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 +9=49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the tens place as well. Wait, let me clarify: the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 can appear in the hundreds place. The numbers from 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)= 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems right. I think I did it correctly.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, totaling 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, totaling 40, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, in the units place, there are 49 occurrences of 4. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is the last block, and 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,..., up to 488. So, yes, that's 89 numbers. So, the total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is in the units place. So, from 0 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488. Let me see: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the total for the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, I subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Each block has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in 400-488.  \n   Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89  \n   Total occurrences: 89\n\n**Total 4's:**  \n\\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49\\)\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Each full block contributes 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.  \n   Total occurrences:  \n   \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\)\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Total occurrences: 0\n\n**Total 8's:**  \n\\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\)\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which rounds down to 48, but since 484 is included, it's actually 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (10s) plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, which includes 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many such numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and the last partial decade (481-488) includes 488, which is another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count them: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last one, so 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. Wait, but earlier blocks had 10 numbers each. So, let's see: 4 blocks with 10 each and one block with 9. So, total tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, no, let me check again. From 0-99: 80-89: 10. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, total tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 =49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one 4. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and one partial decade (481-488) containing 484. Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every block of 100 numbers has a decade (e.g., 40-49) where the tens digit is 4. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each contributes 10 numbers. Total: 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Pages 400-488 each have a 4 in the hundreds place. Total: 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute one 8. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and one partial decade (481-488) containing 488. Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every block of 100 numbers has a decade (e.g., 80-89) where the tens digit is 8. There are four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial block (480-488) with 9 numbers. Total: 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page number reaches 800, so no 8's here. Total: 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in the 400s would be from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last range would be 480-488. Let me count how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, that's 9 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens place in the 400s would have 8 full ranges of 10 numbers each (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total in the 400s: 8*10 + 9 = 89? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because each of the ranges like 400-409 is 10 numbers, so 400-409 is 10, 410-419 is another 10, up to 470-479, which is 8 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 8*10=80, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 89. But wait, that's only for the 400s. But earlier, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has one range where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400s, we have 89 numbers where the tens digit is 4? Wait, that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 pages, but the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 470-479, which is 8 ranges of 10, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8*10 +9=89. So, total tens digit 4's: 4 (from other hundreds) +89=93? Wait, that seems high. Wait, no, because in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but each of those is 10 numbers, so from 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 40-49 \u219210. From 100-199:140-149\u219210. From 200-299:240-249\u219210. From 300-399:340-349\u219210. From 400-488: The tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, that's 9 ranges, each 10 except the last one which is 9. So, 8 full ranges (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479) which is 8*10=80, plus 480-488 which is 9 numbers. So, total in 400-488:80+9=89. So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 (from 0-399) +89=40+89=129. Wait, that seems too high. Wait, no, because in the 400s, the tens digit being 4 is 89 numbers, but that's not correct because the tens digit being 4 in the 400s is only when the tens digit is 4, which is 400-409, 410-419, etc., but each of those is 10 numbers, so 400-409 is 10, 410-419 is another 10, up to 470-479, which is 8 ranges, so 8*10=80, plus 480-488 which is 9 numbers, so 80+9=89. So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 (from 0-399) +89=129. Wait, but that can't be right because the total number of page numbers is only 488. So, maybe I'm overcounting. Let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in the following page numbers:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 400-409:10\n- 410-419:10\n- 420-429:10\n- 430-439:10\n- 440-449:10\n- 450-459:10\n- 460-469:10\n- 470-479:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nWait, that's 13 ranges. So, 10*12 +9=129. So, total tens digit 4's:129.\n\nWait, but that's including the 400-488 range, which is correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 page numbers.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:129\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+129+89=267.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place:49.\n\nTens place: as calculated, 129.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+129+89=267.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers:8,18,28,...,488.\n\nWait, 488 is included, so how many numbers? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.\n\nSo, units place:49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\nLet me count these:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 267-98=169.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 267 seems high for 4's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:129\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+129=178+89=267.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:267-98=169.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nTens digit is 4 in:\n\n40-49:10\n\n140-149:10\n\n240-249:10\n\n340-349:10\n\n400-409:10\n\n410-419:10\n\n420-429:10\n\n430-439:10\n\n440-449:10\n\n450-459:10\n\n460-469:10\n\n470-479:10\n\n480-488:9\n\nWait, that's 13 ranges. So, 12 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9.\n\nSo, 12*10=120 +9=129. So, yes, 129 is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\n80-89:10\n\n180-189:10\n\n280-289:10\n\n380-389:10\n\n480-488:9\n\nSo, 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 267-98=169.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the hundreds place of 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 169 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - 0-99: 10 occurrences  \n   - 100-199: 10  \n   - 200-299: 10  \n   - 300-399: 10  \n   - 400-488: 89 (including partial range 480-488)  \n   Total occurrences: 129.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in page numbers 400-488.  \n   Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 129 + 89 = 267.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - 0-99: 10  \n   - 100-199: 10  \n   - 200-299: 10  \n   - 300-399: 10  \n   - 400-488: 9 (480-488)  \n   Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.  \n   Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n267 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 169.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{169}."

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, and then check if the last number is beyond that. But 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481-488 are the next group. So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus if the last partial group has a 4, which it doesn't because 488 is 488, so the units digit is 8. So, units place 4's: 48 times. Wait, but let me think again. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once. 11-20, once, etc. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49, that's one range. Then 100-199: 140-149, another range. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So, how many ranges? Let me count: 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, let me check that again. 48 (units) + 50 (tens) = 98, plus 89 (hundreds) is 187. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10 each: 5*10=50. That's correct. So, 50 in the tens place. Units place: 48, as calculated. Hundreds place: 89. So, 48+50+89=187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges are there in 1-488. From 1-99: 80-89, that's one range (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: the next range would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8's are in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, that can't be right because 49+49 is 98, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. Now, the number of 4's was 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, earlier when I calculated the number of 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98, which gives a difference of 89. But let me verify each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48 times (from 4,14,...,484). Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so 48 times. But earlier, I thought maybe 49, but now I'm confused. Let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the 48th cycle ends at 480, and the next cycle is 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so 481-488. So, in the units place, 48 times. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nTens place 4's: 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: from 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nTens place: ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, the last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, you might include or exclude certain numbers. Let me check the units place for 4's again. For example, page 484 is included, right? So, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 +4. So, yes, 48 times. Similarly, for 8's, 488 is included, so units place 8's: 49 times.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For any digit position, the count can be calculated as follows.\n\nFor units digit:\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if d <= N%10 else 0).\n\nSimilarly for tens place: floor(N/100) * 10 + max(0, min(10, N%100 - (d*10) +1)).\n\nBut maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, let's use a formula.\n\nFor units place 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, and since 4 <= 488%10=8, we add 1 if 4 <=8, which we do, so 48+1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount_units = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488:\n\ncount_units_4 = 488//10 + (1 if 8 >=4 else 0) = 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier count. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place 4's: 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\ncount_units_8 = 488//10 + (1 if 8 >=8 else 0) = 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 48, but using this formula, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 49 times.\n\nTens place 4's: Let's use the formula for tens place.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\ncount_tens = (N // 100) * 10 + max(0, min(10, N % 100 - d*10 +1))\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488:\n\ncount_tens_4 = (488 // 100) *10 + max(0, min(10, 488%100 -4*10 +1))\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\nSo, 88 -40 +1=49.\n\nBut since 49>10, we take min(10,49)=10.\n\nSo, count_tens_4=40+10=50.\n\nThat matches my earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds place 4's: numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. Wait, let me check:\n\n49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, total 4's:188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49 times.\n\nTens place: Let's use the formula.\n\nd=8, N=488.\n\ncount_tens_8 = (488//100)*10 + max(0, min(10,488%100 -8*10 +1))\n\n488//100=4, so 4*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\n88 -80 +1=9.\n\nSince 9>0, count_tens_8=40+9=49.\n\nSo, tens place 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now using the formula, it's 188-98=90.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the initial count of units place 4's. So, the correct count is 49 units place 4's, leading to total 4's as 188.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because this is a bit confusing.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nFor units place 4's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10=8 >=4, add 1, so 49.\n\nTens place 4's: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, 488%100=88. So, 88 -40=48, plus 1=49. Since 49>10, take 10. So, 40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, it's 488-400+1=89.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so add 1:49.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. 488%100=88. 88-80=8, plus 1=9. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think I initially made a mistake in counting the units place 4's as 48 instead of 49. Once corrected, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, giving a difference of 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Total occurrences: `488 // 10 = 48` full groups of 10, plus an additional '4' in 484. \n     - **Total:** 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - **Total:** 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit '4' appears in numbers 400-488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - **Total:** 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188** times.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - Total occurrences: `488 // 10 = 48` full groups of 10, plus an additional '8' in 488.\n     - **Total:** 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Each range contributes 10 numbers, except the last range (480-488), which contributes 9.\n     - **Total:** 4 ranges \u00d7 10 + 1 range \u00d7 9 = 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n     - **Total:** 0 times.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98** times.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (which is 10 numbers), then each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. Let me count: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, 440-449 is included, but what about 450-488? The tens digit is 4 only up to 449, so yes, 440-449 is fully included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. Let me count how many such numbers. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. To find how many terms, I can use the formula: ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). Wait, is that right? 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's from 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct. Now for 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Let's see how many full ranges there are within 488. The ranges are: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 0 to 488, every 10 numbers has an 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding up: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each have 10 numbers. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 1 range. From 100-199: 1 range. From 200-299: 1 range. From 300-399: 1 range. From 400-488: 440-449 is another range. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from page 400 to 488. Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Now, I need to count the number of times 8 appears. Let's do the same for 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 numbers, right? Because from 0 to 488, each 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. From 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the hundreds place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges do we have? From 0-99: 10. From 100-199: 10. From 200-299: 10. From 300-399: 10. From 400-488: 9. So total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, 40-49 is the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so all 5 sets are valid. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number with 8 in the units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many steps of 10? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many sets are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, that's 4 full sets and one partial set. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me double-check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus the 4 in 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, which is 48*10 + 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, no, actually, let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete decades (each 10 numbers) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48*1 = 48. Then, in the incomplete decade, which is 480-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, I'll do the same for 8's. Let me go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48*1 = 48. Then, in the incomplete decade (480-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so it's 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count the number of such ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, no, let me check again. The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each, so 4*10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9. So total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in the range 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, contributing 10 per range, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, contributing 10 per range except the last (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
