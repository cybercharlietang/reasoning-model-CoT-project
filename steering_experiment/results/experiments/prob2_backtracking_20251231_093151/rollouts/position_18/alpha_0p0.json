    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so it's fully included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 occurrences. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, the blocks where the tens digit is 8 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, check if 480-489 is included. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, does that affect the count? Wait, in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, the 8 in the tens place still occurs 9 times (480-488). Wait, but I thought the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers in each block. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me clarify: For the tens place, each block of 100 has a 10-number block where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. But in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, does that mean the last block contributes 9 instead of 10? Wait, no, because 480-489 would be the 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. The blocks before 400 are complete: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought each block before 400 contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that 480-488 is part of the 400-488 block, and the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times there. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the first four blocks) + 9 = 49. But wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th number. Wait, maybe I should calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me see: (484 - 4) = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many full ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last one is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, and the last one (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** In ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 8 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** In ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 occurrences. The range 480-488 contributes 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 divided by 10) rounded up. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take the floor, which is 48. But wait, when counting from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4 as the first. Wait, 484 is 48*10 +4, so that's the 49th 4 in the units place. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 +1)/10 = 48.9, so taking the floor gives 48, but since 488 is included, maybe it's 49? Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate it as (488 - 4)/10 +1. So, (488-4)=484, 484/10=48.4, so 48 full decades, plus the 49th starting at 480+4=484. So, 49 times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think of a smaller example. From 1 to 20, how many 4's in the units place? 4,14,24. Wait, 24 is beyond 20, so only 4 and 14. So that's 2 times. Using the formula: (20 -4)/10 +1 = (16)/10 +1=1.6+1=2.6, which would be 2 when taking the floor. Wait, but 20 is included, and 24 is beyond, so maybe the formula isn't perfect. Alternatively, maybe the number of 4's in the units place is floor((488 +6)/10). Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to consider that in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So total 48 +1=49 4's in the units place. Okay, so units place: 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's count the decades:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n- 140-149: another 10.\n- 240-249: another 10.\n- 340-349: another 10.\n- 440-449: another 10.\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. So that's 5*10=50. Okay, so tens place: 50 4's.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, which occurs in page numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, that can't be right because 4's in the hundreds place are only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So that's correct. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, how many terms? The formula is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of this. So, each of these decades contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one which only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens place 8's would be:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo total 8's in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So yes, 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. For 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 10. Similarly for 180-189: another 10, and so on. So 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, for 4's in the units place, I had 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89, totaling 188. For 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0, totaling 98. So the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So 89 4's there.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 49, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484-4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, from 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the 4's in the tens place. Let me check again. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 1-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 49, which is correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 4's total 188, 8's total 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted in the same way. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 occurrences\n- Tens place: 50 occurrences\n- Hundreds place: 89 occurrences\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 occurrences\n- Tens place: 49 occurrences\n- Hundreds place: 0 occurrences\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th number because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since we start counting from 0, it's 49? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. But each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, does the last group (480-488) have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within that group. So, that's 48 times for the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, when we reach 484, that's the 49th occurrence because 4,14,...,484 is 49 numbers. Hmm, I'm getting confused here. Let me think of it as for each page number, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last block is 480-489, but since the book only has 488 pages, we don't go up to 489. So, in the last block, from 480 to 488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 484 is within this block, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from the first 480 pages) plus 1 (from 484) equals 49. Wait, but 480 is page 480, so the first 480 pages would have 480/10=48 occurrences. Then, pages 481-488: 481,482,...,488. So, in this range, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Okay, so units place has 49 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a decade where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49 (first hundred), 140-149 (second hundred), 240-249 (third hundred), 340-349 (fourth hundred), and 440-449 (fifth hundred). Now, since the book goes up to 488, the last range 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, how many ranges? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check. 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 50 numbers. So, the tens place has 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but I'm only considering the hundreds digit being 4. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Let's see: the last page is 488, so 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98=90, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me verify the counts again. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 4's. I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both digits: 4's had 49, 8's had 49. So, the difference is in the hundreds place where 4's have 89 and 8's have 0. So, 89 more 4's in the hundreds place. Then, the tens place: 50 vs 49, so 1 more 4. Units place: same. So, total difference: 89+1=90. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, so maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Wait, no, because in each group of 10, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in 488 numbers, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) plus 8 more numbers (from 481 to 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times plus an extra 4 in 484, so total 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times the units digit is 4 from 1 to 488. So, the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers after that. The last occurrence is at 484. Now, how many such numbers? Let's see: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 ranges * 10 = 50 numbers. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. Now, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges there are. The first four ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 numbers. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial range, totaling 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would happen in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ full groups} + 1 \\text{ (for 484)} = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\text{ full groups} + 1 \\text{ (for 488)} = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.  \n   Each full range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).

    "text": " So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers. 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, how many sets? There are 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last set: 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can do 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, it's 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Yes, that's 49 numbers. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which is 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so only 9 numbers instead of 10. Let me count each set: - 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Checking 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's correct. Similarly, in the units place for 8's, I had 49 numbers because 488 is included. For 4's in the units place, 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, that seems correct. Wait, but when I calculated 4's in the units place, I thought 484 is the 49th, but actually, from 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but since 484 is within 480-489, which is the 49th cycle, so yes, 49 times. Similarly for 8's. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Hmm, maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the units digit is 4 or higher. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Alternatively, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which is 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so the 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 48 complete sets (1-480) giving 48 fours, and then from 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last set. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last one which has only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Let's count the sets: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So total eights in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems high.

Correct because from 4,14,...,484: that's 49 numbers.\n- Tens place: 5 sets (40-49,140-149,...,440-449). Each set has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49. From 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 480-488 (9 numbers). So 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 4 to 484, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (from 400 to 488, inclusive).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (from 8 to 488, inclusive).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each complete range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by (N // 10) + (1 if the units digit is >=4 else 0). But since N is 488, let's see. For units digit 4, it's every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, starting at 4, each step of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449? Since the book ends at 488, yes, 449 is within 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number contributes one 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but since we're only considering the hundreds digit, each of these contributes one 4. So, 89 times. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges and the partial one. From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four ranges contribute 4*10=40, and the last one contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For 8's, in the tens place, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the units place, the last 4 would be at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, maybe it's 49 times. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Wait, but wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Now, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, we only have 480-488. So, in the tens place, the 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, we have 4 ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Alternatively, I can think of it as for each group of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, which gives 48. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4 in the units place, making it 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, that's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). But how many times does the hundreds digit 4 appear? Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers, but each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: Well, 480-489 would be the next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Wait, but 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times in 480-488. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, etc.) and one range of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place:49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Wait, that can't be right because 188-98 is 90, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? The last number is 484, which is 484=4+10*(n-1). So, 484=4+10*(n-1) \u2192 480=10*(n-1) \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u2192 5*10=50. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. How many? 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, the last is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm getting 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. That seems correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Units place 49. So, 188 seems correct. For 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I'm wondering if I double-counted somewhere or missed something. Let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. So, 98 total. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, yes, 89. So, 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th number. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is only up to 449, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is included, so it's 49 numbers. Wait, 8,18,...,488. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 numbers because 8*1=8, 8*49=392, but wait, 8*50=400, which would be 400, but 400 is beyond 488. Wait, no, 8*50=400, but 400 is within 488. Wait, no, 8 in units place occurs at 8,18,...,488. So, starting from 8, each step of 10. The number of terms is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That is (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the first four blocks: 4 blocks *10=40. The last block: 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total in tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 40, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 times. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by N divided by 10, taking the integer part, and then adding 1 if the digit is less than or equal to the units digit of N. Hmm, maybe a better way is to calculate how many full decades there are and then check the remainder. For units digit 4: The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, plus 1 if the units digit of 488 is >=4. Since 488's units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that makes sense because from 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences, and then from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another occurrence. So total 49 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 times. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? Using the same method: 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is equal to 8, we add 1, so 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one, contributing 10. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. Now, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, but when counting the tens place, each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers. But in the case of 480-488, it's only 9 numbers. So, how does that affect the count? Let me think. For the tens place, the ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-489: but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, plus the partial range 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 800. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. There are 48 full decades (480 numbers) and one partial decade (481-488). The units digit 4 appears 49 times (48 + 1).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** From 400 to 488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. This range includes 89 numbers (400-488), contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades and one partial decade, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 40 occurrences, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** Since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 4 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, the last block, 440-449, is within 488, so it's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me check if 480-489 is within the book. The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the page numbers. So, how many blocks? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which rounds down to 48, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49 times. Wait, no, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9? Each cycle of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete cycles of 10 in 488, which is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last cycle isn't complete. But since we're only looking for the units digit, every cycle contributes one 4, so 48 times. However, wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, how many 4's in units place? Let's see: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers), giving 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is 488, so the last units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. Wait, no, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 48th 4 in the units place. So, total 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 4's in tens place. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, total number of 4's in the tens place is 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Similarly, each subsequent hundred has another 10. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89 \u2192 total=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0 \u2192 total=98. Difference=187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. I initially thought it was 48, but when I considered 484 being the last 4 in the units place, I thought maybe it's 49. But when I calculated floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, and 488 is 48*10 +8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place for 4's is 48. Similarly, for 8's, units place is 49 because 488 is included. So, yes, 49 for 8's units. Tens place for 4's: 50, which seems correct as 5 ranges \u00d710. Tens place for 8's: 49, which is 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) contributing 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 49. Hundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's. So, yes, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with an additional 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 488, the first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) // 10, which is (489) // 10 = 48.9, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent hundred has another 10 numbers: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So, that's 5 ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But in each of these, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Let's check each hundred:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers\n\nSo that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which is in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many? The number of 8's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributing 10 per range. With 5 such ranges, there are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last (480-488) has 9. Total: 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, from 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, starting from 8, 18, ..., 488. How many terms? The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but we only go up to 488, so how many numbers in the tens place are 8? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480 is the first, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, total occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484, maybe it's 49? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, which is 48 full groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included. So, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1 to 480) plus 1 (at 484), totaling 49. Okay, so units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488, so starting from 8, every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 480-488 range, 488 is the units digit 8. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's 48 times because 488 is the 49th occurrence, but since 488 is the last page, let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought 48, but now it's 49. Let me confirm. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except possibly the last one. Let's count: From 1-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many numbers are there from 480-488? That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last range contributes 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the floor gives 48, but since 484 is within 488, it's 49 times. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the total number of pages divided by 10, using integer division. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48, with a remainder of 8. So, the units digit cycles 48 full times, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 numbers where the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit goes up to 8 on page 488. So, in the units place, the 4 appears once every 10 pages, so 488 // 10 = 48 times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit. The 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, which is within the first 100 pages. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit is 4 for each number from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, adding up all the places: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187 times. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer division gives 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 numbers where the units digit goes up to 8. So, the units digit 8 appears 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears on page 488 as well. So, 488 // 10 = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra if the last partial decade includes an 8. The number of complete decades is 488 // 10 = 48. In each complete decade, there's exactly one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Now, the last partial decade is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once in this partial decade. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many blocks? Each full block is 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. There are four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last partial block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all 9 of these numbers, contributing 9 more 8's. So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that can't be right because 187 - 98 is 89. But let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4 and 8 to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 // 10 = 48, so 48 times. Correct.\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct. So total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 488 // 10 = 48, plus 1 for the last partial decade (481-488), so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks (4*10=40) plus 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me think again. When I was counting the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But each of those numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as a block, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place there.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 187 - 98 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 488 // 10 = 48 complete decades, contributing 48 instances. The remainder (8) includes another 4 in the units place (page 484). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 instances, totaling 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 488 // 10 = 48 complete decades, contributing 48 instances. The remainder (8) includes another 8 in the units place (page 488). Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 instances (4 * 10 = 40). The last block is 480-488, contributing 9 instances. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488. Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluation, the correct total for 4's in the units place should be 48, not 49, as 484 is within the 488 pages but does not add an extra 4 beyond the 48 complete decades. Thus, the corrected total for 4's is 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Corrected Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the remainder is more than 4? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. Since 8 is greater than 4, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, for units place, the number of 4's from 1 to n can be calculated as floor((n + 1) / 10) if the digit is 0, but for other digits, it's floor(n / 10). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times, but wait, starting from 4, which is the first occurrence. So, 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 4 is 1, 14 is 2, ..., 484 is 49th. So, 49 times. So, units place: 49 4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many 8's in the units place? Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, and then 8 in the units place of the 49th decade. So, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many full blocks there are.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers).\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 (10).\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 (10).\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 (10).\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488. Here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and the last block contributing 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only when the number is from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. Yes.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, number of 4's:\n\n- Units:49, correct because 4,14,...,484: 484 is the 49th.\n- Tens:50, because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 blocks, each 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds:89, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units:49, from 8,18,...,488: 488 is the 49th.\n- Tens:49, from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 4 full blocks of 10 and one of 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as a block where 440-449 is included, which is correct. For 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total digits printed.\n\nBut maybe I should think about another approach, like calculating for each digit position separately.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each position:\n\nFor each position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nBut I think my initial approach is correct. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check for the hundreds place again. For 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. For 8's, since 800-899 isn't in the book, so 0.\n\nUnits place:49 4's, 49 8's.\n\nTens place:50 4's, 49 8's.\n\nSo, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, in the incomplete set from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nThat's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. However, we need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, it's okay. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 4,14,...,484: (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48+1=49\n- Tens: 5 sets of 10: 5*10=50\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 8,18,...,488: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49\n- Tens: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 5 sets, but the last set has 9 numbers. So 4*10 +9=49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct.

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 can be calculated by taking the total number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 // 10 = 48, and then adding 1 if the remainder is 4 or higher. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th? Let me see: 4,14,...,484. So from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 after that. So the last one is 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's 49 times. So maybe I was wrong earlier. So perhaps the correct count is 49. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N - d)/10) + 1, if d <= N mod 10. Wait, let me test this with N=488 and d=4. So floor((488 - 4)/10) = floor(484/10)=48, then +1 gives 49. So yes, 49 times. So 49 4's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So how many such blocks are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4 full blocks (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the last block is only up to 488, so from 400-488. So in each full block of 100, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So for the first three blocks (1-399), that's 3 blocks * 10 = 30 4's. Now, the last block is 400-488. How many 4's in the tens place here? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, and then 410-488 would have the tens digit as 1,2,...,8, so only up to 409. So that's 10 more 4's. So total in the tens place is 30 + 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 499, but our book ends at 488, so it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 40 + 89 = let's see, 49+40=89, 89+89=178. So 178 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nSimilarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So the count is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only up to 488. Let's calculate:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 488-480+1=9.\n\nSo total in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all these. So yes, 9 times. So total 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0 8's here.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49, correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, which is correct because the book only goes up to 488. So 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 178, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, let me recount the number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 40\nHundreds place:89\nTotal: 49+40=89, 89+89=178. Correct.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:49\nHundreds place:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo 178 -98=80. So there are 80 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 4's there. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I had 40. Let me see: Each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. From 1-99: 40-49, so 10 4's. Then 140-149: another 10, and 240-249: another 10, and 340-349: another 10. So that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. But wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10, making it 50. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, earlier I said the tens place for 4's is 40, but now I'm thinking it's 50. Wait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the first block is 1-99: 40-49, which is 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nThen 100-199: 140-149, another 10.\n\n200-299:240-249, another 10.\n\n300-399:340-349, another 10.\n\n400-488:400-409, another 10.\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, so earlier I had 40, but now I'm getting 50. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, so let's correct this. The tens place for 4's:\n\nFrom 1-99: 40-49 \u219210\n\n100-199:140-149\u219210\n\n200-299:240-249\u219210\n\n300-399:340-349\u219210\n\n400-488:400-409\u219210\n\nSo total 5*10=50.\n\nSo that's 50, not 40 as I previously thought. So that changes the total number of 4's.\n\nSo units place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 178, but now it's 188. That's a difference of 10. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the initial calculation, I thought the tens place had 40 4's, but now I see it's 50. So I must have missed a block. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the hundreds blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each block except the last one has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. The last block, 400-488, has 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So 5 blocks *10=50.\n\nSo the correct count for tens place is 50, not 40. So the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the 8's again.\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so now I'm getting 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 4's was 40, but now it's 50, which makes the total 188. So the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, let's recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: numbers ending with 4 from 4,14,...,484. As calculated, 49 times.\n\nTens place: in each hundred block, 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. 5 blocks, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 4's was 40, but now I'm getting 50. So I think I made a mistake in the initial count. So the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. Let's list them:\n\n1-99:40-49 \u219210\n\n100-199:140-149\u219210\n\n200-299:240-249\u219210\n\n300-399:340-349\u219210\n\n400-488:400-409\u219210\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. So yes, 50 is correct.\n\nSo the total number of 4's is 49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's is 49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 80, but now it's 90. I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nSo, to sum up, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's again. The tens place for 8's: from 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last block only has 9 numbers. So 4 blocks with 10 each, and the last with 9. So 4*10 +9=49. So yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nSo total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo yes, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because earlier I thought the answer was 80, but after correcting the tens place for 4's, it's 90. So I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me think differently. Maybe using a formula for digit counting.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated using the formula:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times d appears.\n\nFor example, for units place:\n\nNumber of times d appears = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, let me test this for N=488 and d=4.\n\nUnits place: (488//10)=48, then check if 488%10 >=4, which is 8>=4, so add 1. So 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nNumber of times d appears in tens place = (N // 100) * 10 + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 +1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to break it down.\n\nFor tens place, the formula is:\n\ncount = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif remainder >= 20:\n    count += 10\nelif remainder >= d*10:\n    count += remainder - d*10 +1\nelse:\n    count +=0\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, for each position, the count is:\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe number of times 4 appears is:\n\nnumber of complete hundreds * 10 + extra in the incomplete hundred.\n\nSo for 488:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds = 4 (since 488//100=4)\n\nEach contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So total 40+10=50. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds =4, each contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the incomplete hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 40+9=49.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNumber of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 80, but after correcting the tens place, it's 90. So I think 90 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately. \n\n1. **Units place (4's):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place (4's):** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in each block of 100 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place (4's):** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, resulting in 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place (8's):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place (8's):** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in each block of 100 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place (8's):** There are no page numbers in the hundreds place where the digit is 8 since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and taking the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in each digit place. Let's consider each place separately. \n\n**Units place:**\n- For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.\n- The total number of such groups in 488 pages is 48 full groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8) and then a partial group from 481 to 488.\n- So, in each full group, there's one 4, so 48 times.\n- In the partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is in this range, which adds one more 4.\n- So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n- Let's calculate how many such blocks there are in 488 pages.\n- The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers.\n- The next blocks are 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n- Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks in total (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 5 blocks * 10 = 50.\n- Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, which is within 488, so yes, it's included.\n- So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488.\n- How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's using the same method.\n\n**Units place:**\n- Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then a partial group from 481-488.\n- In the partial group, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is one more 8.\n- So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens place:**\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n- Let's see how many such blocks are in 488 pages.\n- The first block is 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n- Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389.\n- The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, this block is only up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480-488).\n- So, how many full blocks are there? 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's four full blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40.\n- The partial block from 480-488 contributes 9 8's (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488).\n- So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n- The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 more. So total 49 in tens place. Units place is 49 as well. So total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. And in the tens place, 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Units place: 49. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So total 98. So 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about the units place for 4's, I considered 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, but then realized that 484 is the last 4 in the units place, which would be the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for 8's, the last occurrence in the units place is 488, which is the 49th occurrence.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - Every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (480 numbers) and a partial group (481-488).\n   - Each full group contributes 1 occurrence: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - Number of such blocks in 488 pages: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place.\n   - Total groups: 48 full groups and a partial group (481-488).\n   - Each full group contributes 1 occurrence: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - The partial group includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - Number of such blocks in 488 pages: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial block (480-488).\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The partial block (480-488) includes 9 numbers, contributing 9 more.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but the first page is 1, so starting from 4, which is the first occurrence. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it differently. For each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last set is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's the 49th occurrence. Hmm, so maybe it's 49 fours in the units place. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is in 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. Okay, so units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one set, contributing 10 fours. Then, 140-149: another set, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets? Let's see: 40-49 is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 5 sets, 10 each, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units place:49, tens place:50, hundreds place:89. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. Wait, let me check that addition: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to fours, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the tens place 8, but only up to 488. So, let's see: Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it doesn't complete the 10. So, 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, totaling 49 eights. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. Total eights:49+49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems a lot. Let me go through each step again to see if I made a mistake. First, counting fours: units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct, but let me check if I counted correctly. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. That seems correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Units place:4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, so 49 fours. So, 89+50+49=188. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, so 49 eights. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights. So, 49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For a three-digit number, we can consider each digit position separately. Let's think about the units place first. For units place: For both 4 and 8, they appear once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) + (if the remainder is >=4, add 1). Wait, but earlier I calculated 49. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488's units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. Similarly, for 8 in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49. So, that's consistent with my earlier count. Now, for the tens place: For 4 in tens place, the number of times is calculated by considering how many complete hundreds there are, each contributing 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens place can be 4 again in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so 40+10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: in each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens place can be 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49. That's consistent with my earlier count. Now, hundreds place: For 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For 8, there are no hundreds in 488, so 0. So, adding up: fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights. I think this makes sense, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484 for the units place, it's 48 times, but wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 4. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is floor(n/10) + 1 if the units digit is d. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. For each complete set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 480 divided by 10 is 48. So, 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times this happens. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1=49. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-489: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, plus the partial range 480-488 contributing 9. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is in the hundreds place 4, so the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers. So yes, 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   \n   Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n   \n   Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, starting from 4, which is the 1st, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, but does 449 exceed 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49 numbers. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. Yes, that's 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is from 480-488. So, let's count: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each (4*10=40) plus 9, so 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check: 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, I need to count the number of 8's.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count how many ranges there are. Each range is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10).

    "text": " Wait, no, actually, the first 4 is at 4, which is the 5th number (since 1-3 are 1,2,3, then 4). Wait, no, maybe it's better to think of it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me compute that: (484 - 4) = 480, 480/10 = 48, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. Let's see, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place. The first number is 400, and the last is 488. The total number here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-489 would only be up to 488. Let's check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 4 ranges with 10 numbers each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the range 400-488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.  \n   Number of occurrences:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 5 blocks are within 1-488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last number is 488. Let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, the next at 18, and so on up to 488. So, how many numbers? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included. But the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, that's another block. Let me list all blocks where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks *10 + 1 block*9 = 40 +9=49 times. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as having 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but does that mean the tens digit is 8 for all of them? Let me think: 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, ..., 488 has 8. So yes, 9 numbers. So, that part is correct. Similarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488-400+1=89. So, I think my count is correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, resulting in 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, maybe I should think differently. For each set of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, giving 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within the 481-490 set. So, that's 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does that affect the count? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. So, starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds another 4. The number of 4's in the units place is (488 + 1) // 10. Wait, (488 +1) is 489, divided by 10 is 48.9, so 48 times. Wait, but when I think about it, 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one set, contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last set with 4 in the tens place is 440-449. So, how many such sets? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets, 10 each, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up the 4's in each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds another 8. So, from 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Wait, that's different from the 4's. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier for the 4's, I thought it was 48 times. Let me check that again. For the 4's, the last occurrence in the units place was at 484, which is the 48th set. So, 48 times. But for the 8's, the last occurrence is at 488, which is the 49th set. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many complete sets? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one partial set of 9 (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 8? Wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 or lower. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, but 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, which is beyond 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) contributing 10 each, and 480-488 contributing 9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, I had 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for the 4's, I had 187, and for the 8's, I have 98. So, the difference would be 187 -98=89.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? From 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but actually it's 49. Because 484 is the 49th term. So, units place for 4's: 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place for 4's is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place, it's 49.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the units place for 4's was 48. It's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, let's recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing one 4.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. So, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full decades (80-89, etc.) and 480-488, which is 9, so 4*10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so I think I initially miscalculated the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49. Let me confirm:\n\nFor units place of 4's: starting at 4, each 10 numbers adds another 4. So, from 4 to 484, how many terms? The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for units place of 8's: from 8 to 488, step 10. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. So, I think the correct count is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, so 98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because initially I thought 4's were 187, but now it's 188. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSo, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188.\n\n8's: units:49, tens:49, total 98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 4 to 484, step 10).\n   - **Count:** 49\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449):**\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - **Count:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - **Count:** 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - This sequence has 49 terms (from 8 to 488, step 10).\n   - **Count:** 49\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488):**\n   - Four full decades contribute 10 each, and the partial range 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - **Count:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers in a 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Count:** 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times. Wait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have to check if 488 is included. Let's see: starting at 8, each step of 10. The number of terms is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block except the last has 10 numbers, but the last one has only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 49th because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, 48 full tens and then one more. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, in the tens place, the 4 appears in each of these hundreds blocks. Let's calculate each: - 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. - 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. - 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. - 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, each block contributes 10, and there are 5 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let's count each block: - 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 is 10. - 200-299: 280-289 is 10. - 300-399: 380-389 is 10. - 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. In the 400-488 range, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1. Let me calculate that: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division gives 48, and adding 1 gives 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, which is within 488. So, 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 4 in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 groups, each with 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then an extra 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except the last one, which has 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49 + 49 = 98. But let me double-check the tens place. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 10\u00d74=40 plus 9=49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but let me check again. Wait, 188 - 98 is actually 90. But I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. So, that's correct. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have miscounted the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount. The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, that's correct. So, 8's total is 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but 188-98 is actually 90. But I think I might have made a mistake because I remember that in similar problems, the difference is often 90, but I want to make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. Let me go through each digit place again. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference:90. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong. Alternatively, I can calculate it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one set of 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another set. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 numbers. But wait, in the last set, 440-449, the hundreds digit is 4, but we're only considering the tens place here. So, each of these sets contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, total 8's in units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set of 10. From 100-199: 180-189 is another set. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, each of the first four sets contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, and the last set contributes 9 numbers. So, total 8's in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, total 8's in hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed: 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 48. Tens place: 50. Hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49. Tens place: 49. Hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but wait, when counting the units place for 4's, I initially thought 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But then, 488 is included, so does that add an extra 4? Wait, 488 is a page number, so in the units place, 488 has an 8, not a 4. So, the units place for 4's: from 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? Let's see: The first 4 is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4 + 10k, where k=0 to n, such that 4 +10k \u2264488. So, 10k \u2264484 \u2192 k \u226448.4. So, k=0 to 48, which is 49 terms. Wait, so earlier I thought 48, but actually it's 49. So, units place for 4's: 49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: from 8,18,...,488. That's 488/10 = 48.8, so 49 terms. So, units place for 4's: 49, not 48. So, I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188. Total 4's: 188. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, so the difference is 90. But let me check again. Units place for 4's: numbers ending with 4 up to 488. The last such number is 484, which is 4 + 10\u00d748 = 484. So, that's 49 numbers (from k=0 to k=48). So, units place: 49. Tens place for 4's: as before, 5 sets (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each set has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so how many terms? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 49 terms. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, difference: 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but the first page is 1, so does 0 count? No, because page numbers start at 1. So from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the 49th occurrence would be at 484, which is within the 488 limit. So maybe I should add 1 more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each full cycle of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So 48 cycles give 48 fours. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 ranges, each with 10 fours: 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 8 more (481-488). Each full cycle has one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8 (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4*10=40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds place 8's. So, total hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 89 (eights) = 98. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For the 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. 187-89=98. Yes, that seems right. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences. The last partial set (481-488) doesn't include another 4 in the units place. Total: 48.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Total: 5\u00d710=50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're only going up to 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, but since 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's once every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, we take 48 full times, and then check if 488 has a 4 in the units place. 488 ends with 8, so no. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, how many such groups are there? From 0-488, we have 5 groups of 100: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each group, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 5 groups * 10 = 50. But wait, the last group is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the tens place? That would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 doesn't have 4 in the tens place. So, actually, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Therefore, total number of 4's in the tens place is 4 groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but 488 ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, counting 8's in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many such groups: From 0-488, we have 5 groups of 100, as before. In each group, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers, except the last group. In the last group, 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the first four groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. In the last group, 480-488, it's 9 numbers. So total 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but wait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers, which is correct. And for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct. So, the total 4's are 187, 8's are 98, difference is 89. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Units place for 4's: 48, correct because from 4,14,...,484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's 49? Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm confused. Let me recount the units place for 4's. The units digit is 4 in numbers 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, actually, it's 49, not 48. So, I made a mistake earlier. Units place for 4's is 49, not 48. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's also 49, as 8,18,...,488. So, correcting that, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, now I'm getting 90. Let me confirm. Units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49. Tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 groups, each 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: 49, as before. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, difference is 188 -98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many full decades there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.

    "text": " So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since we include 484, it's actually 49 times. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. But in this case, since we're going up to 488, the last page is 488, so the units digit for 4's in the units place would be up to 484. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but we take the integer part, which is 48. However, since 484 is included, it's actually 49 occurrences. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by: count = (N // 10) + 1 if N % 10 >= d. So, for N=488 and d=4, 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so count=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens. Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40. Now, check if there's a partial block beyond 400. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's another 10. So, total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? Using the same formula as before: N=488, d=8. 488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is >=8, so count=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. How many complete blocks? 4 blocks (1-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, which is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 +9=49 times. Wait, let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 more. So total in tens place:40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. However, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 can appear every 10 numbers. The first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, but 488 is included. So, starting from 8, the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, 8 appears in the units place 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. However, since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 484 is the last one, that's 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the total number of pages divided by 10, rounded down, plus one if the digit is less than or equal to the units digit of the total number. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial group. For the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Each block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of complete blocks is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is incomplete. In the last block, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included. So, in the incomplete block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is the only 4 in the units place here. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from complete blocks) plus 1 (from the incomplete block) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first block (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check the last block: 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 449 is included, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place as 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first occurrence is at 8, the last is at 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 times. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's and 8's. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488-400+1=89. Correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 49 numbers, as calculated. 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49. So, 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
