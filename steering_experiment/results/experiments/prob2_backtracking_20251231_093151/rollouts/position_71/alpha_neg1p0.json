So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Is there any overlap or something I missed? For example, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449: does that include 444, which has two 4's? Yes, but when counting the tens place, we're only counting the 4 in the tens digit, regardless of other digits. So, each occurrence is counted once per digit. So, in 444, the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 4, and the units digit is 4, but each is counted separately. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, in 488, the tens digit is 8 and the units digit is 8, so that's two 8's in that number. So, in the tens place, 480-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the tens and units. So, that's correctly accounted for as 9 numbers in the tens place (480-488) contributing one 8 each in the tens digit, and the units digit adds another 8 for 488. So, that's correct. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.

    "text": " Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \n   Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   \n   Total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
