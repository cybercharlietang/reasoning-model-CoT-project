That's correct. Now, for the tens place of 4's, I considered 440-449 as part of the 4's in the tens place, but does 440-449 also have 4's in the hundreds place? Yes, but when counting the tens place, we're only considering the tens digit, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, that's fine. Similarly, when counting the units place, we're only looking at the units digit, regardless of the other digits. So, that seems correct. Another way to think about it: For the 4's in the hundreds place, each of those 89 numbers also has a 4 in the hundreds place, but they might also have 4's in the tens or units place. But when we count each digit position separately, we're not double-counting; we're just counting each occurrence in each position. So, for example, the number 444 would have been counted once in the hundreds place, once in the tens place, and once in the units place, each time contributing to the count of 4's. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's, the number 488 would have an 8 in the tens and units place, but when we count the tens and units separately, each occurrence is counted once. So, that's correct. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.

Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, 49 eights in the tens place.

Wait, but I feel like that's a lot, but maybe it's correct. Let me think differently. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a different approach to verify. Another way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears. For example, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last few numbers if the total isn't a multiple of 10. Similarly for tens and hundreds places. Let me try that approach for 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, total number of pages:488.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - How many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48*1=48.\n  - Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1-8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total units place 4's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - For the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. So, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 \u00f7100=4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40.\n  - Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is in the 400-488 range. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188. Same as before.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- **Units place:**\n  - Similarly, each group of 10 has one 8 in the units place. 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 complete groups, contributing 48 8's.\n  - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- **Tens place:**\n  - For the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contribute 4*10=40 8's.\n  - Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place here.\n  - So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- **Hundreds place:**\n  - The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 8's here.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98. Same as before.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately, we determine that there are 188 occurrences of the digit 4 and 98 occurrences of the digit 8.

Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach to confirm. Another way is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position for each page number range. Let's split the book into three parts: 1-99, 100-399, and 400-488. But maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, let's consider each digit position separately for all numbers from 1 to 488. For the units digit: - 4 appears 49 times, as we saw. - 8 appears 49 times. For the tens digit: - 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. For the hundreds digit: - 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Total 8's:49 +49 +0=98. So, 188-98=90.

When I count the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me confirm that: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 -480 +1=9. Yes. So, 9 numbers. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block which has 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

For the 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, not 10. So, 480-489 would be 10, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.
