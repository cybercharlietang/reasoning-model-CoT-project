Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I feel like maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. And for the tens place, each set is 10 numbers, so 5 sets give 50. Units place, 49. So, 188.

So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I just thought, in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, that's correct. So, the difference is indeed 90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the units place, 488 has an 8 in the units place and an 8 in the tens place. So, when I counted the units place, I included 488 as an 8, and when I counted the tens place, I included 480-488, which includes 488's tens digit 8. So, each occurrence is counted separately, which is correct because each digit is in a different place. So, 488 contributes two 8's, one in units and one in tens, which are both counted. Similarly, 448 would have a 4 in hundreds, tens, and units, but since we're only counting 4's and 8's separately, each digit is counted in its respective place. So, I think my counts are accurate.

So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the tens place in both 4's and 8's? For 4's, in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. For 8's, in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one has only 9 numbers because 489 isn't in the book. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, which is 49. That seems correct. Hmm, another way to think about it: for the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). So, up to 400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 40+9=49. Correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., each hundred contributes 10, and since we go up to 488, the last set is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct. So, yeah, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct.

Hmm, that seems right. I don't think I made a mistake, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as per digit position. Another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position is to use a formula. For example, for the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is floor(n/10) + (1 if the remainder is >=d else 0). Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, for each digit position, we can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that approach for verification.\n\nFor the units place:\n- Number of 4's: For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total complete sets in 488 pages: 488 // 10 = 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? 484 is within this range, so that's one more. So, total 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n- Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, for each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488//10=48 complete sets, and in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with tens digit 8 (e.g., 80-89). So, in 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. For the first four blocks, each has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- No numbers with hundreds digit 8, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.

So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This gives 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
