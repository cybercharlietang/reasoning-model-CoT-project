Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. For the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98.

    "text": " 49 times. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like that might not be right. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something in the hundreds place for 8's, but no, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers from 800 onwards. So, hundreds place for 8's is zero. Hmm, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in page numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The number of terms is calculated by dividing the last term by 10 and adding 1: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the hundreds place in page numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal number of 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears in page numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n   - The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal number of 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Calculating the difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
