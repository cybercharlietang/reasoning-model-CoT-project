    "text": " 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 +49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could count the number of times each digit appears in each position. For the units place: For 488 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except maybe the last few numbers. But since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the last set will have 8 numbers (481-488). So, for units place, the number of times each digit appears is 48 full sets of 10 (1-480), which gives 48 times each digit, and then 8 more numbers (481-488), which adds 1 more for digits 1-8. So, for 4 in units place: 48 +1=49. For 8 in units place: 48 +1=49. That matches what I had before. For tens place: Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, let's think differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, in 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-400). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds *10=40 times for each digit. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit in 401-488, we have: - Tens digit 0: 10 numbers (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1:10 (411-420)\n- Tens digit 2:10 (421-430)\n- Tens digit 3:10 (431-440)\n- Tens digit 4:10 (441-450)\n- Tens digit 5:10 (451-460)\n- Tens digit 6:10 (461-470)\n- Tens digit 7:10 (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8:8 numbers (481-488)\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480-488 includes 480, which is part of the tens digit 8. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens digit 8's: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 9=49. Which matches my earlier count. Similarly, for the digit 4 in the tens place: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. Which matches my earlier count. For the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98=90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about it, the hundreds place for 4's contributes a lot, but for 8's, there's nothing in the hundreds place.

Is there a possibility I've miscounted in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in the tens place. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. Difference is 90.
