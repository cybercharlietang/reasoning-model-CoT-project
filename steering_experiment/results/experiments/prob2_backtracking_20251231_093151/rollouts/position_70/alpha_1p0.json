So, total 8's:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I feel like that might be off. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should check each digit position more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a different approach to verify. Another way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears. For units place: For each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is total pages /10, rounded up if the last page has a 4. Similarly for 8's. Let me try that approach. Total pages:488. For units digit 4: number of times 4 appears is floor(488/10) +1 if 488 mod 10 >=4. 488/10=48.8, floor is 48. 488 mod10=8, which is >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod10=8, which is equal to 8, so add 1. So, 48+1=49 eights in units place. Now, tens place: For the tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many fours in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is beyond 449, so actually, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total fours in tens place:40+10=50. Similarly for eights in tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 40+9=49 eights in tens place. Hundreds place: For fours, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For eights, since 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0 eights. So, total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. Total eights:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check the last number. 488 is included, so (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. - Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. - Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. But for the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, we've already counted all those 4's. So, perhaps the count is accurate. Alternatively, maybe I should check with a smaller number to see if my method is correct. Let's say, for example, a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. 4's: 4,14 => 2 fours. 8's:8,18 =>2 eights. So, difference is 0. Using my method: Units place: 4,14 =>2. Tens place:40-49 isn't in 20, so 0. Hundreds place: none. So, 4's:2. Units place for 8's:8,18 =>2. Tens place:80-89 isn't in 20, so 0. So, 8's:2. Difference 0. Correct. Another example: 50 pages. 4's: 4,14,24,34,44 =>5 in units. Tens:40-49:10 numbers, but in 50, it's 40-49, so 10 fours in tens place. Units:5 fours, tens:10, hundreds:0. Total 15 fours. 8's:8,18,28,38,48 =>5 in units. Tens:40-49: no, 80-89 isn't in 50, so 0. So, 8's:5. Difference:15-5=10. Let me count manually: 4,8,14,18,24,28,34,38,44,48. So, 4's:4,14,24,34,44 =>5. 8's:8,18,28,38,48 =>5. Wait, that's only 5 fours and 5 eights, so difference 0. Wait, but according to my method, I got 15 fours and 5 eights, which is wrong. Hmm, so my method is flawed. Wait, where did I go wrong? Let's see. For 50 pages: Units place: 4,14,24,34,44 =>5 fours. Tens place:40-49:10 numbers, but in 50, 40-49 is included, so 10 fours in tens place. So total 15 fours. But when I count manually, I see that each page number only has one digit per position, so 40-49 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, but the units digit varies. So, in 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 fours in the tens place, plus the units place fours:4,14,24,34,44. So, 5 fours in units, 10 in tens, so 15 fours. But when I list all page numbers up to 50, I only see 5 fours in the units place and 10 in the tens place, so total 15 fours. But when I count manually, I think I'm confusing the total count. Wait, each number like 40 has a 4 in the tens place, so that's one 4, and 44 has a 4 in both tens and units, so that's two 4's. So, in 40-49, each number has one 4 in the tens place, and 44 has an extra in the units. So, in 40-49, there are 10 fours in the tens place, and one additional 4 in the units place (at 44). So, total fours:10 (tens) +5 (units) +1 (extra at 44)=16? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 40-49: each number has a 4 in the tens place, so that's 10 fours. Then, in the units place, 4,14,24,34,44. So, 44 is already counted in the tens place, but it's also in the units place. So, total fours:10 (tens) +5 (units) =15, but 44 is counted twice. So, the actual count is 10 (tens) +5 (units) =15, but 44 is included in both, so the total number of 4's is 15, not 16. So, in the 50-page example, there are 15 fours and 5 eights, so difference is 10. But when I manually listed the numbers, I only saw 5 fours and 5 eights, but that's because I was miscounting. Let me list all the fours in the 50-page book: Units place:4,14,24,34,44 =>5 fours. Tens place:40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49 =>10 fours. But note that 44 is counted in both, so total fours are 5 +10 =15, but since 44 has two 4's, the total number of digits is 15, but the number of numbers is 15? Wait, no, the count is 15 digits, not numbers. So, in the 50-page example, there are 15 fours and 5 eights, so the difference is 10. That makes sense now. So, my initial method is correct. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   Number of 4's:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:  \n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   Number of 4's:  \n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   Each complete range contributes 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers.  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   Number of 8's:  \n   \\[\n   0\n   \\]\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
