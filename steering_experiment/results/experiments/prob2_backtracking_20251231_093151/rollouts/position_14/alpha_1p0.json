    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, that would be 48 times. But wait, let me check. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 numbers end with 4. But let me confirm: the first number ending with 4 is 4, and the last is 484. The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I was wrong earlier. It's 49 times. Because when you count inclusive, you have to add 1. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, meaning 48 numbers ending with 8. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many terms? It's ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but is 480-488 correct? Let me see: 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only when the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units: 49, Tens:49, so total 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we're only considering the units place, it's every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times because 488 / 10 is 48.8, and we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. So, up to 400, we have 4 blocks where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 numbers. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, so that's 10 more. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, because 400-499 would be another block, but our book stops at 488. So, up to 488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is included. Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 49 times. Wait, because 8 is the first one, then 18 is the second, so 488 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each block contributes 10 numbers, except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, since the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, that would mean 48 times 1, but actually, each set of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, for each 10 numbers, one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing a 4, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, 484 is within that range, so that's another 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributing a 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it is. So, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but wait, let me check that again because 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. So total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me check that again. Wait, units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Now, moving on to count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full tens, each contributing an 8 in the units place, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, 488 is the last one, so that's another 8 in the units place. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9. Let's count how many ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. The first four ranges are full (80-89, 180-189, etc.), each contributing 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total 8's in the tens place: (4 ranges * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems quite a big difference. Let me verify the counts again.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let me recount. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers: 14, 24, ..., 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. Let's solve for n: (n-1)*10 \u2264 484 \u21d2 n-1 \u2264 48.4 \u21d2 n \u2264 49.4. So, n=49. So, 49 numbers with 4 in the units place. That's correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50. The ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges *10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. From 8, 18, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264480 \u21d2 n-1=48 \u21d2 n=49. So, 49 numbers. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49. Ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but the book only has 488 pages, so 90 more 4's than 8's seems plausible? Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 4's there.\n\nIn the tens place, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nUnits place, 49.\n\nTotal 4's: 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it another way. Let me consider how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, which is less than 4, so actually, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then check if 488 >= 4 + (48)*10=484. Since 488 >=484, there's one more 4 in the units place at 484. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor((488 +1)/10)=48, and since 488 ends with 8, which is >=8, so 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- Number of 4's: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 8 (80-89). So, from 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\n- Number of 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\n- Number of 8's: Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but perhaps that's correct. Let me think of a smaller example to test my method. Suppose the book has 28 pages. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-28.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24 \u21923 times.\n\nTens:40-49 doesn't apply, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:3.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28\u21923 times.\n\nTens:80-89 doesn't apply, so 0.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:3.\n\nDifference:3-3=0. Hmm, that works.\n\nAnother example: 84 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits:4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84\u21929 times.\n\nTens:40-49:10 numbers, but since the book ends at 84, 40-49 is within 84, so 10 numbers. So, 10.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:9+10=19.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88\u2192 but 88 is beyond 84, so up to 78. So, 8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78\u21928 times.\n\nTens:80-84:5 numbers (80,81,82,83,84), each with 8 in the tens place.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, it's 48 times, but wait, the first occurrence is at 4, so from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, 49 times in the units place. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should think of it as for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, in the 480-489 range, we have 484, which is within 488, so that's another 4. So, 48 times from 1-480, and one more in 484, making it 49. Yeah, that seems right. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 440-449 range is fully included, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 count fully? Yes, because 449 is within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the hundreds, tens, and units places for 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 50 (tens) + 49 (units) = 188 times. Wait, let me check that again. 89 in hundreds, 50 in tens, 49 in units: 89+50=139, 139+49=188. Hmm, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check each component. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 blocks, so 50, correct. Units place: From 4,14,24,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is the last one. So, how many terms in this sequence? The nth term is 10n - 6, but maybe an easier way is to note that it's every 10 numbers starting at 4. So, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49, correct. So, 49 units place. So, total 4's: 89+50+49=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 ends with 8. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the last number is 488. Let's compute how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488, common difference 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299: 280-289, another 10. 300-399: 380-389, another 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 block of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but wait, let me confirm. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Tens place: 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Units place: 49. Total:89+50=139+49=188. For 8's: Units place:49. Tens place:49. Hundreds place:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers from 800-899 exist.\n   - Total: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, maybe I should think differently. Let me see, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit cycle through 0-9. Each cycle of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total cycles in 488 pages: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles and 8 extra numbers. Each full cycle contributes 1 four, so 48 fours from the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 doesn't appear in the units place in these. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks exist. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, how many blocks is that? From 0-99: 1 block. Then 100-199: 1 block. 200-299: 1 block. 300-399: 1 block. 400-488: Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another block. So that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. For each block, like 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So yes, 10 fours per block. So 5 blocks give 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total fours: 187. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me count how many such numbers. From 1 to 488, how many full cycles of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once in the units place (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let me count the number of such blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189 is another. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: 480-488. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, actually, each block contributes 10 eights except the last one, which contributes 9? Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but each has an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. Let me clarify: For each block except the last, it's 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 eights each, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For fours: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, but that might not be accurate. Maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481-488 are the next 8 pages. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, there are 48 occurrences of 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 48 full groups and then 8 more pages. So, the units place 4's would be 48 times, because the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481-488 don't add any more 4's in the units place. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, how many ranges? 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. For page numbers 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds place has 89 occurrences of 4. Now, let me add up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, how many times? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, and then 8 more numbers from 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears once more. So, units place: 48 +1=49 times.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of times 8 is the last digit, which is every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The nth term is 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 +10(n-1)=488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 numbers ending with 8. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488-480+1=9).\n\nWait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, that seems off because when I counted the 4's, I had 187, and the 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187-98=89. But let me double-check my counts because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount:\n\nIn the tens place, the 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers (80 to 89)\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 49, as each 10 numbers have one 8, and 488 is included, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nNow, 4's: 187, 8's:98, so 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again to make sure I didn't overcount.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 times. Because from 4,14,...,484. 484 is 48\u00d710 +4, so that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 488, so units place 4's: 48.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488: that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89).

When I count the 4's in the hundreds place, I have 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 5 ranges, each with 10, so 50.\n\nUnits place:48.\n\nTotal:187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's every 10 numbers, so from 0 to 488, that's 489 numbers. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is the last page, 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be beyond 488, so 440-449 is within 488. Let me check: from 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct. Now, for the 8's, I need to do the same process. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of times is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, that's 49 times. Wait, because 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's 488 // 10 + 1 if 488 mod 10 == 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, so it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 480-489: since the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, each set from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set has 9 numbers. So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, that's correct. And for the tens place of 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. Units place for 4's: 48 times. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units place: 49 times, tens place: 49 times, hundreds place: 0. So, 98 total. 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the last one, so from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? Let me think. From 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 divided by 10 is 48, but since we include both the start and end, it's 49 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right because 4 is the first, then 14, 24,..., 484. Let me count how many numbers end with 4 up to 488. The units digit cycles every 10, so for each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, the 48th block ends at 480, and then there's 481-488. In the 481-488 range, the next 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So actually, it's 49 times for the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So yes, 49 times. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula here. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated as floor((n + 1) / 10). So for n=488, floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. But wait, that would give 48, but earlier I thought it's 49. Let me check with n=484. floor((484 + 1)/10) = 48.5, which floors to 48. But 484 is the 49th occurrence because 4,14,...,484. So maybe the formula isn't directly applicable here. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens plus one if the units digit is >=4. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So 4,14,24,...,484. To find how many terms there are, I can calculate ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So yes, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449, because 450-459 would be beyond 488 only up to 488. Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Let me count how many such blocks there are. Each block is 100 numbers apart: 40-49 (40-49), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, all 5 blocks are complete. So 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The first is 8, last is 488. So ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. Since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the range, but only up to 488. So the blocks are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (including both ends). So yes, 9.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds =49 +49 +0=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, that's not quite right. Actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete sets of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full sets, giving 48 fours. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Let me check. From 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this last partial set, there's no 4 in the units place. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 fours. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. In this case, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? The number of sets of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, totaling 48. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last set (481-490), the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, actually, it's 49 occurrences because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no. Let me think again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: There's no 480-489 because the book ends at 488. So, 480-489 would be pages 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488? Wait, no. The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but the tens digit in 480 is 8, right? So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count all the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total number of 8's in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 numbers from 1 to 480).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (ranging from 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (every 10 numbers from 8 to 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (ranging from 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, in the 48th block, the units digit 4 occurs at 484. So, yes, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. Then, the next block would be 140-149, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, how many blocks is that? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, which occurs from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.

Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many 8's in the units place? From 1 to 488, each block of 10 has one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the last block (481-490), only up to 488 is included. So, the units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is within the range. So, that's 48 occurrences, plus one more at 488, making it 49? Wait, no. Because 488 is the 48th block? Wait, let's think differently. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of times 8 is the units digit from 1 to 488. So, how many numbers between 1 and 488 have 8 as the units digit? It's floor(488 / 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8 or higher. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so it's floor(488 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, let's count how many blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 eights in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so 9 eights. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Since 488 mod 10 = 8, number of occurrences: \\( \\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but that's not the right approach. Alternatively, since the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 groups would cover up to 480, right? So from 1 to 480, each group of 10 has one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, there's another 4 in 484, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such decades are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is only 10 numbers, right? So 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in units place, so 48, plus the last group from 481-488, which includes 484, so one more, total 49. Tens place: as above, 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So 89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The last number is 488, which ends with 8. So from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So 49 8's in units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in decades like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is included, so 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers). So total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 8's in hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Now, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the tens place, I thought there were 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4 full sets of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but in the 4's count, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nIn the 8's count, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the 4's in the hundreds place would be 89, but let me confirm.\n\nYes, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in decades like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, from 8, 18, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in decades like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but since we're counting discrete numbers, maybe it's better to think of it as (488 / 10) rounded down, but that might not be precise. Alternatively, I can note that every 10 numbers have exactly one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? There are 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last number, the 48th ten ends at 480, and then we have 481-488. So, in the units place, how many 4's? From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences (since 480 / 10 = 48). Then, in 481-488, there's another 4 at 484. So total 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 480 is the 48th multiple of 10, so 4, 14, ..., 484. Let me list them: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1 = 49. So yes, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within range. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). So from 1-488, how many hundreds? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred (400-488). So, in each full hundred, the tens place 4 appears 10 times. So for 1-300, that's 3 hundreds, so 3*10=30 times. Then, in 400-488, the tens place 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488, right? So that's another 10. So total in tens place is 30 + 10 = 40. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens place 4's are in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 40 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 40 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 40 = 89, then 89 + 89 = 178. So 178 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let me count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract 8's from 4's: 178 -98=80. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=89. Total=49+40=89, 89+89=178. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. 178-98=80. Hmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (1 occurrence every 10 numbers):**\n     - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place (10 occurrences every 100 numbers):**\n     - Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Total in tens place: 40 (30 from 1-400 and 10 from 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place (400-488):**\n     - 89 occurrences (all numbers from 400 to 488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place (1 occurrence every 10 numbers):**\n     - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place (10 occurrences every 100 numbers, plus 9 from 480-488):**\n     - Total in tens place: 49 (40 from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 and 9 from 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's (178) - Number of 8's (98) = 80.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{80}"

    "text": " Wait, but that might not be accurate because we're dealing with whole numbers. Let me think differently. From 1 to 488, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48. But wait, in the last partial block, 481-488, does the units digit include a 4? Let me check. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is in this range, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating before. Alternatively, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, the integer part is 48, but since the last number is 488, which is beyond 480, we have an extra 4 in the units place at 484. So total units 4's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49, that's one block. Then 140-149, another. 240-249, another. 340-349, another. And 440-449, which is another. Now, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is indeed less than 488, so yes. So total tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So total hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. The last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, the number of 8's is 48 (from 8,18,...,488). Wait, but 488 is included, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49? Wait, no. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so the number of times is floor(488/10) which is 48, but since 488 is included, that's 48+1=49? Wait, no, because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. Let me check: The first occurrence is 8, then 18, ..., up to 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, does 480-489 also have 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since our book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, but the tens place is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, but in our case, up to 488, so 80-89 is within 488. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's five blocks, but the last block (480-488) only has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The fifth block (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total: 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but since 484 is the last one, that would be 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set has one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4? Let me check: 488 is 488, which is 480 + 8, so 488 doesn't have a 4 in the units place. So the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th set. So 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, because 8, 18, ..., 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8 * 1 = 8, 8 * 2 = 16, but wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades, which is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 is included, which is 488 = 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. 187 - 98 = 89. That seems correct. I think I did this right.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4. However, since 484 is included, it's 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 doesn't appear as the hundreds digit in 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but that's not the right approach because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many tens are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of the 48 full tens, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten, which is 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page. Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's is the number of times 4 appears in 1-488 in the units place. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of such 4's is the number of complete decades (sets of 10) up to 488, which is 48 full decades (since 48*10=480), and then from 481-488, there's another 4 in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 exist? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the possible tens places with 4 are: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit from the right. This happens in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of complete decades plus any in the partial decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8, making it 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is within 488, but 480-489 would be the full range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place is only up to 488. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check if I made any mistakes in the counts. Let me go through each digit place again. **Counting 4's:**\n\n- Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: The 4 appears in the tens place in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- Units place: same as 4's, 48 full tens, each with one 8, and 488 is included, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: none, since 800+ pages don't exist. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I count 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct. So, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8 in tens, up to 488. So, 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 8's again. Since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page number with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades contributing 48 occurrences, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, contributing 10 each for the first four ranges and 9 in the last, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we're dealing with whole numbers, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's 49 numbers. Wait, no, actually, from 4 to 484, inclusive, how many steps? Let me think. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49, that's one range, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last range, 440-449, is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same arithmetic sequence formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 8's. Let's count the ranges. From 80-89: that's one range, 180-189: another, 280-289: another, 380-389: another. So, that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, does 480-489 also have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since our book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 8's. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, does 480-488 count as a separate range? Because earlier, we considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., which are all full ranges. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, the 8 in the tens place appears 10 times in each full range, and 9 times in the last partial range. So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, that might not be the right approach. Let me think. Each set of 10 consecutive numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last set goes up to 488, which is beyond 480. So, does that mean there's an extra 4 in the units place at 484? Let me check: 484 is within 480-489, so yes, that's an extra 4. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 484), totaling 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is included, but 488 is not a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, the 4's in the units place occur at 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let me check how many such ranges there are within 1-488. The ranges are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Now, 440-449 is within 488, so all these ranges are valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is before 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402,...,488. So, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences, except the last one, which contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). Let's count them: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers are 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since 488 <800. So, 0. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This contributes 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the last page, so 484 is included. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another occurrence. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (40-49), 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is included, right? Yes, 488 is page 488, so yes, 89 numbers. So, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10. Now, 480-489 would be another, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for the tens place, we have four blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the 480-489 block: since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit is 8 only up to 488, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10, except the last one which is only 9. Wait, no, because 480-489 is beyond the book's page count of 488. So, the last block is 380-389, which is entirely within 488. So, actually, only four blocks, each with 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but 480-489 isn't included because the book stops at 488, so the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, does that mean the tens place 8's are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now it's 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me clarify: The tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 5 blocks, with the last block having 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. That's 40 so far. Then, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 more, making it 49 in the tens place. So, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. Total 8's: 98. Wait, no, 49 + 49 = 98? Wait, 49 + 49 is 98, yes. But wait, earlier I thought the units place 8's were 49, and tens place 49, so total 98. Now, the 4's were 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, let me confirm my counts again because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. For the tens place, 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, that's not the right approach. Maybe it's better to think about how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. Since each group of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete tens (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens). So, 48 times 1 equals 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, in the units place, the last 4 is at 484, which is within the 480-489 range. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place as part of numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 times 10 equals 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place as part of numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many groups of 10 are there? From 1 to 488, that's 48 full tens (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 8's. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488, which is included in the 48th group. So, 48 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place as part of numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. So that's 4 blocks. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 equals 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place as part of numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (40) = 88. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 187 - 88 = 99. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For the 4's: units: 48, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units: 48, tens:40, hundreds:0. 48+40=88. 187-88=99. Hmm, so the answer is 99 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And for the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the 8's, the tens place blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which is 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Units place: 48. So, total 88. So, 187-88=99. Yeah, that seems right. So, the answer is 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 within 488, so 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 within 488, so 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** \n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389.\n   - There are 4 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** \n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - So, 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 48 (units) + 40 (tens) = **88**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 88 (8's) = **99**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the last page, so maybe I should think of it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 pages. From 1 to 488, there are 488 pages, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, maybe it's 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. However, the 48th group ends at 480, so from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So, actually, there are 49 times where 4 is in the units place? Wait, no. Let me think again. For each ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such groups are there? From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481-488). In each of the 48 full groups, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 pages, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, how many terms? Let's see, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me check how many full blocks there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, so 4*10=40. The last block contributes 9 times because it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, total number of 8's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     - From 1 to 480: 48 times (since 480 \u00f7 10 = 48).  \n     - From 481 to 488: 1 time (484).  \n     - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     - From 8 to 488: ((488 - 8) \u00f7 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Number of full blocks: 4 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).  \n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 occurrences (480, 481, ..., 488).  \n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Every 10 numbers, there's exactly one number with a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). But wait, in the units place, the 48th group would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the units place in 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. So, let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of 4's in the units place, right? So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the 8 is at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is included, so does that add another 8 in the units place? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48*1=48. Then, in the incomplete cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-489: 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, instead of 10, it's 9 numbers. So, the 480-489 range only has 9 numbers in our case. So, the tens place 8's would be 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me recount the 8's in the tens place. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range of 9. So, 4*10=40 and 9, total 49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 8's. 4's: 187. So, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers. There are 5 such ranges, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in page numbers 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

Totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but that's not correct because 484 is the last one. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate how many full groups of 10 there are in 488. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But each group contributes one 4 in the units place. So that would be 48 times. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is within 488. So, yes, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the total pages, so let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms here can be found by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that makes sense because 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 440 is 440, and 449 is 449, which is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 is within 488, so that's another range. So, how many ranges? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so the last range is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 4 full ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, total in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 80-89: 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 times 10 and 1 time 9, which is 40 +9=49. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188-98=90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the units place: from 4,14,...,484. Let me see: 484 is 484, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, correct.\n\nIn the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, 98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 480-488: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, yes, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds for 8's, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.

    "text": " Wait, that's not exact. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 488, so units digit is 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but in the tens place, each of these contributes one 4 in the tens digit per number, so 10 per range. So total 50 times. But let me check: from 0-99, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249:10, 300-399:340-349:10, and 400-488:440-449:10. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50 times. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 is the 48th group plus 8. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. So, 10(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many ranges. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Wait, 49 in units, 49 in tens, so 98 total. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 187 -98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Yes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 (for 480-488) = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let me think. The pattern is every 10 numbers, so in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. So, 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 484 is the 48th 4 in the units place, so maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is >= the digit. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But since 484 is less than 488, we have 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. But 484 is within the 480-489 range, so that's another 4, making it 49. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, which would be 48.9, so 48 times, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for 488, it's floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times. But wait, 484 is within 480-489, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, maybe it's 48 times. Wait, but when N is 488, the units digit 4 occurs at 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, I think 49 is correct for units place 4's.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 0-99, 40-49: 10\nFrom 100-199, 140-149: 10\nFrom 200-299, 240-249: 10\nFrom 300-399, 340-349: 10\nFrom 400-488, 440-449: 10\nSo, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times.\n\nThe first occurrence is at 8, the last is at 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check using the same method as before. The number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488 is floor((488 +1)/10) = 48.9, which is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488.\n\nSo, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check: from 0-99: 80-89: 10\n100-199: 180-189:10\n200-299:280-289:10\n300-399:380-389:10\n400-488:480-488:9\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal: 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49, correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:0, correct.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me list some:\n\n4,14,24,...,484. So, the first is 4, the last is 484.\n\nThe number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8,18,...,488. Last term is 488. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 40-49 (10),140-149(10),240-249(10),340-349(10),440-449(10). So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8's:80-89 (10),180-189(10),280-289(10),380-389(10),480-488(9). So, 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: none, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Because 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 5 ranges, each 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book ends at 488, 800-899 isn't included, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, maybe another approach: The total number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in each set of 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. For every 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, maybe it's 48 times, but wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488. So, in the units place, the 4's go up to 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place for 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such sets are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, there's an 8 in the units place. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, but wait, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488: Let's see, 8 \u00d7 1, 8 \u00d7 2, up to 8 \u00d7 61 = 488? Wait, 8 \u00d7 61 is 488, so that's 61 occurrences. Wait, that can't be right because 8 \u00d7 60 is 480, and 8 \u00d7 61 is 488, so from 8 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? That's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last term is 488, which is 8 \u00d7 61, but that's not the right way. Alternatively, the number of terms is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, yes, so it's 49 times. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, up to 488. So, each of these sets has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such sets are there? Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 count? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many full sets of 10 are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 4 full sets of 10, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, plus 9 in the last partial set. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 in numbers from 800-899, but the book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me check again. For the 4's in the tens place, it's every 100 numbers, right? So, from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, then 140-149, another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For the 8's in the tens place, I counted 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. That seems right. So, the difference is 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Number of blocks: 5, each contributing 10 4's.\n   - Total 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Since 488 is included, number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Full blocks: 4, each contributing 10 8's.\n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds go up to 400-488. So, how many hundreds? Let's see: 40-49 is in the first hundred (1-100), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many times this happens. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid. Each of these ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers, then 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, total in tens place: (4*10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is the last page, so up to 484, which is 484. So, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. So, 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48, plus 1 because we include both endpoints. So that's 49 times. Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be in the three-digit numbers. Let me count how many full decades there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 10 each. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: that's 10 numbers, but wait, 40-49 is 10 pages, right? Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488. So, how many such ranges? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but wait: 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so 440-449 is fully included. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, looking at the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each range: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. This gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\\[\n49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds do we have? From 1-488, the hundreds go up to 400-488. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, actually, each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Hmm, wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many 8's in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each block of 100 contributes 10 8's in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 times. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is 48*10 + 4, so the count should be 49. But wait, the book has 488 pages, so 484 is within that. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 + 1 (for the 4 in 484) but wait, 488 is the last page. Wait, 484 is the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, actually, from 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Let's see, the first 4 is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? Let's see, starting from 40-49 (that's one block), then 140-149 (second block), 240-249 (third), 340-349 (fourth), and 440-449 (fifth). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The last 8 in units place is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four. Now, 480-489 would be the fifth block, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the block. So, does that count as a full block? Wait, 480-489 is a block, but the book only goes up to 488, so in the tens place, 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, does that count as a full block? Wait, no, because a full block is 10 numbers, but here we have only 9. So, perhaps the number of blocks is 4 full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10 numbers, and then a partial block from 480-488, which contributes 9 numbers. So, total 4*10 +9=49. But wait, let me think again. Each block is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-489:10. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is only up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it as the number of times 8 appears in the tens place is from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's actually 48 full cycles of 10, and then the 48th cycle ends at 480. But wait, 484 is the last one.

So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, but wait, does 488 include 484?

How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one range, then 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. That's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, and since the book goes up to 488, 449 is included. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Wait, but let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? The last occurrence is at 488. So, floor(488/10) = 48 times, but wait, 488 is included, so does that add one more? Let me think: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, which is the 8th number in the first set, and the last is 488, which is the 8th number in the 48th set (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, that's 49 times? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each cycle being 10 numbers) and then an extra 8. Wait, no, actually, each cycle of 10 numbers includes exactly one 8 in the units place. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then the 48th decade is 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 488 is included. So, the units place 8's: 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 occurs at 488, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10 times, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 times. Wait, but let me double-check that. Units place: 48, tens place: 49, hundreds:0. So, 48+49=97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but that's not the right approach. Alternatively, since the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, I can calculate how many full cycles of 10 there are in 488 pages. There are 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full cycles and an extra 8 pages. So, in each full cycle, the units digit is 4 exactly once. So, 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 488, the last page is 488, which is within the 48th cycle (since 48*10=480, so 480-488 is the 48th cycle). So, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., 484. The last one is 484, which is the 48th occurrence because 484 - 4 = 480, and 480/10 = 48. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 10*5=50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times the tens digit is 4. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's check. The units digit is 8 in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units digit 8 appears 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens digit 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each, and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 times. Correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times.\n\n- Tens: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems right.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: From 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. The last one is 488, so (488-8)/10 +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Maybe a better way is to consider the range from 1 to 488. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last one if the total isn't a multiple of 10. So, the total number of units digits is 488. Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, except maybe for the last partial set. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, digits 0-7 will appear 49 times in the units place, and digits 8 and 9 will appear 48 times. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. For each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 complete sets of 10 (48*10=480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In the units place, in the complete sets, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once more. Therefore, the total number of times each digit appears in the units place is 48 for digits 0 and 9, and 49 for digits 1-8. Wait, but 0 appears in the units place only when the page number is like 10, 20, etc., so 0 appears 48 times in the units place. So, for the digit 4, in the units place, it appears 49 times. Similarly, for the digit 8, it also appears 49 times in the units place. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that would be included in the extra 8 numbers. So, digits 1-8 each get an extra count, making their total in units place 49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Now, moving on to the tens place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book only goes up to 488, the last set for 8 in the tens place is 480-488. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. Now for 8 in the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 numbers. So total for 8 in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 49 times. Now, 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, let's sum up the counts for each digit. For digit 4: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For digit 8: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each part again. Units place: Both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's correct. Tens place: For 4, each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, and there are 5 such blocks (0-499, but since we go up to 488, the last block is only up to 488, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. For 8, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Units place: As calculated earlier, both digits appear 49 times each. So, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's are printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, but that's not the right approach. Maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, total number of 4's in units place is 488 // 10 = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer division would give 48. So, 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a decade where the tens digit is 4. So, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 sets of 10 numbers, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49: yes, 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5*10=50. But wait, is 440-449 within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there where the hundreds digit is 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? From 1 to 488, the last number ending with 8 is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer division gives 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 97 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10.

Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add 49 + 50 first, which is 99, then 99 +89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. To find the number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 -480 +1 =9). So, the first four blocks give 4*10=40, and the last block gives 9. So total in tens place is 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 4's. When I counted the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of those is 10 numbers per block, and there are 5 blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in the 400-488 block, the tens place 4's go from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So that's correct, 5 blocks each with 10, so 50. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So that's 4 full blocks (each 10) and the last partial block with 9. So 4*10=40 +9=49, which is correct. So yes, the total 8's are 98. So the difference is 188-98=90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so that's correct, zero. So, I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's 49 numbers? Wait, no, because from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? Let's see: The first number is 4 (1st occurrence), then 14 (2nd), 24 (3rd), ..., 484 (49th). So that's 49 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within that. So, 49 times in the units place for 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, how many numbers is that? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers. So, 484 / 10 = 48.4, which would mean 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus one more (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. There are 5 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only part of the 400s. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 40-49: 10 times. 140-149: 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 is 8 + 10*(n-1). Let's see: 488 - 8 = 480, which is 10*(n-1). So, n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last one (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot, but let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but that might not be accurate. Let me think differently. From 1 to 488, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 blocks of 10. So, 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place there. So, total 4's in the units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers. From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete decades. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th decade (480-489). So, 488 is included. So, 48 full decades give 48 eights, and then in the 480-488 range, the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more 8 (488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count the number of such blocks. From 1-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block from 80-89, etc., has 10 numbers, except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, let me check: 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the first four blocks each contribute 10 eights in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 187. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 5 blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right. For 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place for 4's: 48 times. Tens place for 4's: 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. For 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.

    "text": " Wait, that's not a whole number. Maybe another approach: the number of 4's in the units place up to 488 can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups, so 48 4's in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's in the units place beyond 480. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's count how many such ranges fit into 488. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149 (another 10), then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 would go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, so 5 * 10 = 50. Hmm, but wait, does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Wait, but wait: 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, from 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 8 is the first, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms can be calculated as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's 49 numbers. Wait, because 488 is included, so it's 49 8's in the units place. Wait, let me confirm: the first is 8, the last is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which may be shorter. Let's see: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? Each of the first four ranges gives 10, and the last one gives 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place from 480-488. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.

    "text": " Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as for every 10 numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. That would give 48 times 1, so 48 fours in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So yes, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 is one block, so 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249, another 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349, another 10 fours. Now, 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4 from 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears from 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, that's 9 blocks, each contributing 10 fours? Wait, no. Each block is 10 numbers, so from 400-409, that's 10 fours. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? So, how does that affect it? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit 4 appears 9 times there, but in the other blocks, it's 10 times. Let me count how many full tens blocks there are. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 occurs 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and only occurs 9 times because we stop at 488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times in the 400-409 block and 10 times in the 440-449 block, but wait, no, 440-449 would have the hundreds digit as 4 and the tens digit as 4. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, for each tens digit, how many times does it occur? For example, 400-409: tens digit is 0, 410-419: tens digit is 1, ..., 480-488: tens digit is 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's in the 440-449 range. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. So, in total, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. Therefore, from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought that 400-488 might have only 9 fours in the tens place, but now I'm seeing 10. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating it. So, from 1-99, 40-49: 10 fours. From 100-199, 140-149: 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each contribute 10 fours. So that's 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours. So, total number of fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,...,488. The difference between each term is 10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-99: 80-89: 10 eights. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 eights. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 eights. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 eights. From 400-488: The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks (1-399) each contributing 10, and 400-488 contributing 9. So, 4\u00d710=40 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, total number of eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Now, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 187 fours - 98 eights = 89. So, there are 89 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., contributing 10 occurrences per block. There are 5 such blocks, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., contributing 10 occurrences per block. The last block (480-488) contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 1-488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, but that's 48 times? Wait, let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, and 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Wait, no. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488, but the hundreds digit is only 4 for 400-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 times. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 +89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many times? The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check: from 1-488, how many tens places have 8? The first is 80-89: 10. Then 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, tens place:49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 times. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Wait, that seems correct. But let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. Yes, so 89 times. And for 8's in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, totaling 49. So, yes, 49 times. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Wait, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times the units digit cycles through 0-9. From 1 to 488, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last partial cycle. So, the total number of units digits is 488. Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles and 8 extra numbers. So, for the digit 4 in the units place, it would be 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each digit 0-9 appearing 48 times) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). The units digits in these 8 numbers are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, all numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In these 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me think again. From 1-480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the block. Each block contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, 9 times. So, total 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct. And hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Units place for 4's: 48 times, as from 1-480, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, and 481-488 doesn't add any more 4's. So, 48. Correct. So, total 4's: 187. 8's: 98. Difference: 187-98=89.
