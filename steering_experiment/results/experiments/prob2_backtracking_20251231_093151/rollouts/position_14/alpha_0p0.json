    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such ranges there are up to 488. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 end at 449, which is before 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. Let's calculate: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that happens. The last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, we have 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges are there up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 4's. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. For tens place, 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each 10, so 50. Correct. For 8's, tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each. So, the difference is indeed 90. Wait, but let me check if 488 is included in the 4's. The 4's in the hundreds place go up to 488, so yes, that's correct. Similarly, 488 is included in the 8's units place, so that's correct. So, I think my calculation is right. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is the last one, it's actually 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th set of 10 pages. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let's see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so the count is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 is the last number, and 488 doesn't end with 4, it's exactly 48 times. Wait, but 488 is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is every 100 numbers, 10 times each. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many full sets of 100 there are in 488. The first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149 (another 10), then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, how many such sets are there? From 0-488, the sets are at 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. But wait, 440-449 is from 440 to 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds place is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so let's see how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, the count is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if 488 ends with 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? It's every 10 numbers, so the count is (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, how many full sets of 100 have 80-89? From 0-488, the sets are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except the last one, which is only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, for the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but let me double-check the tens place. For the 480-488 range, how many numbers have an 8 in the tens place? 480 has 8 in the tens, 481, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9. So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each count again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 48 times. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488). 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place: 49 times. Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, so the answer would be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct. For the tens place of 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. 484 is the last one, so 484/10=48.4, so 48 times. Correct. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, plus the last one at 488, so 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4 + (48-1)*10 = 484. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 a total of 89 times. Wait, but actually, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, adding up the units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 49 times? Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. Let me calculate how many terms there are. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so that's 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 numbers each and 1 block with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. So, adding up units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 pages add one more. Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I made a mistake earlier by just dividing 484 by 10. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's count each block. Each block of 100 pages has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers), from 101-200: 140-149 (10), from 201-300: 240-249 (10), from 301-400: 340-349 (10), and from 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears, not how many numbers. Since each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, that's 89 occurrences. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each block. - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89). - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, let me check: 480 is the first, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. Units place for 4's: 49 numbers, correct. For 8's, units place: 49, correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four has 10, last has 9, so 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Correct. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, so there are 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199:140-149 (10) From 200-299:240-249 (10) From 300-399:340-349 (10) From 400-488:440-449 (10) Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times the hundreds digit is 4. In this range, every number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the hundreds digit is 4, but each number has only one hundreds digit. So from 400 to 488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's printed are 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. So blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's check each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189:10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place contributes 0. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's) =90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

Hmm, but wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8's in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 97 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, units place gives us 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. But wait, the last range is 440-449, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 488, so all 10 numbers are valid. So, tens place gives 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place separately. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number with an 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so we take 48. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers because 8 is the first one at 8, then 18, up to 488, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me double-check that. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10: the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place gives 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place gives 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is (Last - First)/Step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks exist. - From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is okay because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Let me see: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 times. But wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so yes, that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which is true for all these numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, there are 187 fours printed. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, but since 488 is included, it's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no hundreds digits of 8 in the page numbers. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n1. **Units Place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 48th? Let me think. The first 4 is at 4, which is the 1st, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on. So, 484 would be the (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor((N - d)/10) + 1 if d <= N, else 0. So for 4 in units place up to 488: floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does the last range, 440-449, go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so all 5 ranges are valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 400-488 includes 489 numbers? Wait, no, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me use the same method as before. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of 8's in units place is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me count how many ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, but the last one (480-488) contributes 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. Difference=188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 188 is correct. For 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers.

The count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, each block is 10 numbers, but the last block might not have 10 numbers because the book ends at 488. Let's check each block: - 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. - 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. - 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. - 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. - 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit is 8 only 9 times here. So, the total for the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

Hmm, actually, maybe a better way is to consider that for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing by 10 gives 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 itself is 488, which ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. Starting from 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, 10 numbers each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 times. Wait, but I need to check if the hundreds digit is 4. So yes, 400-488 all have 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up the counts from units, tens, and hundreds places: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1 to 488, the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So 4 * 10 = 40 times. Wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, but since the book only goes up to 488, the block 480-488 has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 480-488 is another block where the tens digit is 8, but it's only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, I need to add those 9 numbers as well. So, the tens place 8's are in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So total is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but now I see it's 5 blocks, with the last one being partial. So, the tens place contributes 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the counts for 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 97 times. Now, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's the same as the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number is in the current decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full decades and an additional 8 numbers. So, in each decade, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once per decade. Therefore, 48 times from the full decades, and in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included. So that's 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 481-488, so yes, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the 100s, 200s, 300s, and 400s. So, 40-49 is in the 100s, 140-149 in 200s, 240-249 in 300s, 340-349 in 400s, and 440-449 in 500s. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, how many complete sets of 100 do we have? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50 times. But wait, let me check. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nSo that's 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 when the page number is from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, I'm only concerned with the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400-488 inclusive. So, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's see, the first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades plus one if the last number is in the current decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let's break it down:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add that: 49 + 49 is 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units: 49 (from 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units: 49 (from 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I said 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But let's list them:\n\n- 40-49: 10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nYes, that's 5 sets, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each. That seems correct because in each set of 10, the digit appears once, and there are 48 full sets plus one more in the last partial set for both digits.\n\nWait, but for the 4's in the units place, the last occurrence is 484, which is in the 480-488 range, so that's the 49th occurrence. Similarly, for the 8's, the last occurrence is 488, which is in the same range, so that's the 49th occurrence.\n\nSo, yes, both units digits have 49 occurrences.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's, no hundreds place contributions, so 0.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this occurs 49 times (including 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (including 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, starting from 4, the next is 14, and so on. So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers. But wait, 484 is the 48th number because 4 + 10*(47) = 474, but 484 is 480 + 4, which is 48 numbers. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10 numbers) in 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count? Yes, because 484 is within 488. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is the first set. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check. The first block is 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, that's 20. 240-249 is 30, 340-349 is 40, and 440-449 is 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can also be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 count? Yes, because 488 is included. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block except the last one has 10 numbers. So, how many blocks? The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. So, that's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the first four blocks each have 10 numbers, and the last block has 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units place (48) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.

Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so it's 49 times. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 540-549 doesn't exist. Let's see. Each set of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many sets? Each hundred has one set of 10, so 5 sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in tens place: 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many? Let's calculate: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but the book goes up to 488, so 480-489 would be another set, but 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Let me see. Each hundred block: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 1 set of 9 (from 400-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 4, 14, 24,..., 484. Each step is 10, so the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so actually, there are 49 occurrences in the units place. Wait, but 484 is 484, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many hundreds are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges are there. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the first four ranges (0-399) each contribute 10, and the last range (400-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, I take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 4 as the first. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48. But since we include both endpoints, it's 49 numbers. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488 can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which is 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, yes, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, I need to check if 440-449 are within 488. Yes, they are. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate: The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of such numbers is (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so it's 49 times. But wait, when I divide 488 by 10, I get 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 more numbers (0-8). So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 (from 8 to 480) plus 1 (488), totaling 49. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, all within 488, so 10 8's. - 180-189: same, 10 8's. - 280-289: 10 8's. - 380-389: 10 8's. - 480-488: this is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, which is 9 times. Wait, but actually, in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 numbers contributing 8 in the tens place. So, total in the tens place is 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 = 98, +89 = 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 480-488 as 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9. The other ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which are four ranges, each contributing 10. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems correct. For 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Units place for 4: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the last one, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1=49? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 48. Wait, now I'm confused. Let me recalculate the units place for 4's. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? The first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the number of times is floor(488 / 10) = 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, meaning 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included. So, 48 times. So, 48 in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's up to 488, so 488 is included, which is 8 in units place. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, floor is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times. So, yes, 49 times for 8's in units place. So, 4's units:48, 8's units:49. Tens place for 4's: 5 ranges (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Tens place for 8's: 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0. So, total 4's:48+50+89=187. 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\) times.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\) times, and the last range contributes 9 times.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\) times.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449, because 450-488 would have 5 in the hundreds place, but we're looking at the tens place. So, each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49 (which is the first set), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let me check how many numbers are in each range. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers. The last range, 480-488, has 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4 ranges * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

Let me check: from 4 to 484, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another 10, and so on. How many blocks are there? The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1 (140-149), 2 (240-249), 3 (340-349), and 4 (440-449). So that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, I need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are and the partial one. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Each step is +10, so from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 40-49: that's one block. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, how many blocks? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 9 numbers in 480-488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9 =49. So, 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 49 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 =98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, so actually, it's 48 times. Hmm, let me check. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 is calculated by taking the floor of 488 divided by 10, which is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. So, how many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 occurrences. But wait, does 488 count as an occurrence? Yes, because the units digit is 8. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 doesn't have a full 80-89 block because 488 is less than 490. So, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 8 only if the page is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the 8's occur 40 + 9 = 49 times? Wait, no, because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, we have 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, etc.) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, making it 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. For the 8's: units=48, tens=49. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, it's 40 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the units place for 8's. Let me recount the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The common difference is 10. The nth term is given by a_n = 8 + (n-1)*10. We set a_n = 488. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, earlier I thought units=48, but actually, it's 49. That changes things. Let me recalculate. So, for 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. So, total 8's=49+49=98. Now, for 4's: 187 as before. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier in counting the units place for 8's. It should be 49, not 48. Because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th term. So, that changes the total number of 8's to 98. Therefore, the difference is 187-98=89. Wait, let me confirm this. For units place of 8's: starting at 8, each 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? The number of terms is floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = floor(480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 times. So, units=49, tens=49, so 8's=98. So, 4's=187, 8's=98, difference=187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so I made a mistake there. It's actually 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (first 100 pages), 140-149 (next 100), up to 440-449. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. Let me count the number of ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484. As I calculated earlier, that's 49. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389:10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many 8's in the tens place? 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place (480,481,...,488). So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. For 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For 8's in the tens place: 480-488 is 9 numbers, correct. So, 49 units, 49 tens for 8's, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete decades there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, except the last one which might be cut short. Let's check: From 1-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, for the tens place, the first four sets are 10 each, and the last set is 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 fours. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me see how many such blocks are there up to 488. The first block is 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40 times. Wait, but does 480-489 count? Since the book only goes up to 488, the block 480-489 isn't fully included. But the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, I think I should adjust for that. So, the first three blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 numbers, so 4 blocks, but the last block (480-488) has only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's would be 4*10 + 9 = 49? Wait, no, because 80-89 is the first block, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, plus the partial block 480-488 contributing 9, so total 40+9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is actually the fifth block. So, 5 blocks, but the last one has 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks and 1 partial. So, 4*10=40 + 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in the range 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place 8's = 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units place: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total: 48+50=98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: Units place:48, Tens place:49, Hundreds:0. Total:48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. Tens place 8's: The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. So, 49 in the tens place for 8's. So, total 8's:48+49=97. So, the difference is indeed 187-97=90. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, that's correct. So, I think my calculations are correct, and the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 100: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the range 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 100: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 10 each, totaling 40.\n   - The last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s, so 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n48 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts from 0. Let me check: from 0 to 484, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems off because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Alternatively, since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times? Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the total number of pages divided by 10, rounded down. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which rounds down to 48. But wait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? Let's see: starting at 4, every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, the last one is 484. Now, how many terms are in this sequence? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, 49 times. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, and then maybe 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488. Let's break it down. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 201-300: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 301-400: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 401-488: 440-449 and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400s. Let me think: 401-488 includes 440-449 (10 numbers) and 480-488 (9 numbers because 488 is the last). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400s, we have 440-449 (10) and 480-488 (9). So, total in the 400s: 10 + 9 = 19. But wait, each hundred block before that had 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 480-488 (9 numbers). So, total in 401-488: 10 + 9 = 19. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 19 (from 401-488) = 59. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the 400s, so maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is calculated as follows: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in 401-488. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is when the tens digit is 8, not 4. Wait, no, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and the units digit varies from 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 would have 4 in tens place, but actually, the tens digit is 8 there. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That's from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, considering units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The last one is 488. So, starting at 8, every 10 numbers. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488 = 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 480 = (n-1)*10 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-100: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. From 101-200:180-189 \u219210. From 201-300:280-289\u219210. From 301-400:380-389\u219210. From 401-488:480-488. Now, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit goes from 0-8. So, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 (from 1-400) +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0. So, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book is calculated by examining each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds). Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is counted. Subtracting the count of 8's from the count of 4's gives the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each hundred contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10, plus 9 more in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, it's 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the 4's again: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct. Now, for the 8's: units place: 48, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 48 + 49 = 97. So, 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, so 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I considered the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial range with 9. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That's correct. So, 49 in the tens place. Units place: 48. So, 48 + 49 = 97. Okay, that seems right. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, there are 48 instances where 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, for each hundred, there's one block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. There are 4 hundreds in 488 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last block (400-488) only goes up to 488, not 499. However, since we're only considering the tens digit, the numbers 400-488 still have the tens digit as 0-8. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, for 0-399, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but wait, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th occurrence because 488 is 48*10 + 8. So, 48 instances. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers. How many such blocks? From 0-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, check if 480-488 affects this. The tens digit in 480-488 is 8, but wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. The tens digit here is 8 only in 480-488, but since the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, 480-488 would have the tens digit as 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, does that add an extra 9? Wait, no, because when we count the tens digit as 8, it's from 80-89, which is 10 numbers, 180-189, another 10, 280-289, another 10, 380-389, another 10, and 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's would be 4*10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but is that correct? Because 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit being 4, but the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, the 8's occur in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the hundreds digit being 4, and the tens digit being 8, so from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's are 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 50, which came from 4 hundreds (0-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, and then 400-488, which contributes 10 more (440-449), so 40+10=50. That seems right. For 8's, the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct. Units place for both 4 and 8 is 48 each, which makes sense because from 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly for the last digit if it doesn't complete a full set. But since 488 is 48*10 +8, so units digits go up to 8, so each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. How many complete sets are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each. That's correct. Then, in the tens place, as we calculated, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. And hundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. So, the total 4's are 187, 8's are 97, difference is 90. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).

    "text": " But since we're dealing with whole numbers, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts from 4 as the first. Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. Wait, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, I'm only interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: How many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. However, I need to check if the 48th group ends at 480, so the next number is 481, which is still within 488. Wait, but the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is within 488. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences because from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears at 4, 14, ..., 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, but since we start counting from 4, which is the 1st occurrence, the total number is floor(488/10) = 48, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) is 48, but since 488 is included, does that mean 48 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and the last units digit 4 is at 484, which is within 488. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1-10: 1 occurrence (4), 11-20: 1 (14), 21-30: 1 (24), ..., 481-490: but since we only go up to 488, the last occurrence is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but only up to 488. So, in each full hundred, like 1-100, 100-200, etc., there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many full hundreds are there? From 1-400, that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, how many numbers have the tens digit 4? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is the end, 440-449 is fully within 488. So, that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So total tens digit 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409 (10 numbers), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), and then 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. That's 9 blocks of 10, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8, not 4. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, not 4. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 8 blocks, each contributing 10, so 8*10=80. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 400-409 is 10, 410-419 is 10, up to 470-479, which is 10, and then 480-488, which is 9. So, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 8 times 10, which is 80. So, total tens digit 4's: from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. From 401-488, it's 80, as above. So total is 40+80=120? Wait, that can't be right because from 1-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in each block of 100, 10 times. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So total tens digit 4's: 40+10=50. Wait, I'm getting conflicting numbers here. Let me approach it differently. For the tens digit, the number of times 4 appears is calculated by considering each hundred block. For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, 10 numbers have the tens digit as 4. So, from 1-100: 10 times (40-49). From 101-200: 10 times (140-149). Similarly, 201-300: 10 times (240-249). 301-400: 10 times (340-349). 401-488: Now, in this range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have the hundreds digit as 4? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, which is 89 occurrences. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, which is the units digit 8. So, from 1-488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, then 18, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48.8, so 48 full groups, but since 488 is included, it's 48+1=49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 1-10: 8 is the 8th number, so 1 occurrence. 11-20: 18, so another. Continuing up to 488, which is 488th number. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus one if the last number is included. Since 488 is exactly 48*10 + 8, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 8, 18, ..., 488, that's 49 numbers. Let me verify: 8 is the 1st, 18 is 2nd, ..., 488 is the (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49th. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 1-488, the blocks are 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. In each full hundred, like 1-100, 100-200, etc., the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 9 occurrences. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 89 seems a big difference, and I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's. **Counting 4's again:**\n\n- **Units place:** From 1-488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. But wait, 488 is included, which is 488, so 488 has 8 in the units place, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48.\n\n- **Tens place:** As before, each hundred block contributes 10. From 1-400: 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. From 401-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, total tens place: 40+10=50.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488: 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 occurs 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\n**Counting 8's again:**\n\n- **Units place:** From 1-488, every 10 numbers have an 8 in the units place. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. But since 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49.\n\n- **Tens place:** From 1-400: 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place: 40+9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place:** 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For example, for the units digit, in 488 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears approximately 48 or 49 times. Specifically, units digit 4 appears 48 times (since 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48). Similarly, units digit 8 appears 49 times because 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence.\n\nFor the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place (since 488//100=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences per digit, so 4*10=40). Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 again, but only up to 8 (since 488 is the end). So, for the tens digit 4, it appears 10 times (440-449), and for the tens digit 8, it appears 9 times (480-488). So, tens digit 4: 40+10=50, tens digit 8: 40+9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit, only numbers from 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. Hundreds digit 8: 0.\n\nSo, adding up: 4's: 48+50+89=187; 8's: 49+49+0=98. Difference: 187-98=89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1st digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 48 such occurrences because 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10.\n   - **Tens Place (2nd digit from the right):** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, contributing 40 occurrences.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 4 + (48-1)*10 = 484. So, there are 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding them up: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place, I think I made a mistake. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page. So, starting at 8, each step is +10. How many terms are there? The last term is 488. Let me see: 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1 = 48, so n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, right? Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 block, but only up to 488. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? From 1-99: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, how many 8's in the tens place here? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, the 400-488 block contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 each (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 98 8's. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: Units: 48, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. Total 187. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. Total 98. Difference: 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Did I make a mistake? Let me recalculate. If the first term is 4 (n=1), then the last term is 484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place 4's: 49. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 48, but now it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. So, correcting that: Units place 4's: 49. Then, tens place: 50. Hundreds place:89. So total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Similarly, for 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, so I had an error in the units place for 4's. It should be 49, not 48. Let me verify: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 units place 4's. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct. Units place:49, as we saw. So, 49+50+89=188. 8's: units place:49, tens place:49. So, 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Partial block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since 484 is included, maybe it's 49? Wait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. From 1 to 488, the number of decades is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8), so 48 complete decades. Each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the units digit cycles up to 8, but the 48th decade would end at 480, and then 481-488 is the next partial decade. In this partial decade, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 would be included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, in the hundreds place, it's just the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds place is only the first digit, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, plus the 488 itself. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488, where 488 is the 49th. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, since 488 - 480 +1 = 9). So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) has 9 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10, 140-149 is 10, 240-249 is 10, 340-349 is 10, and 440-449 is 10. That's 5 sets, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 488 is included, so it's 48 times? Wait, 8, 18, ..., 488. Let's see: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so the number of 8's is floor(488 / 10) = 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 8, each 10 pages add another 8. Wait, let me check: 8 is the first, 18 is the second, ..., 488 is the 49th. Because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The sequence is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480 => n-1 = 48 => n=49. Oh, so there are 49 numbers where 4 is in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 49th number because starting from 4, each step is 10. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct count should be 49. Let me confirm: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. The difference between consecutive terms is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be beyond 488? No, 440-449 is within 488. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). 401-488: 440-449 (10). So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So total is 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Therefore, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** How many numbers end with 8? They are 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference is 488-8=480, divided by 10 gives 48, so number of terms is 48+1=49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, 480-489 would be next, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-100: 80-89 (10). 101-200: 180-189 (10). 201-300: 280-289 (10). 301-400: 380-389 (10). 401-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks with 10 each, and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that's a big difference. Let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. Yes, that's correct. For 8's, the hundreds digit doesn't appear because the book ends at 488. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, yes, 98 8's. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we're dealing with whole numbers, there are 48 full tens in 480, but wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 4. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete cycles and a partial cycle. In each complete cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Now, in the partial cycle from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers), 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers), 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers), 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers), 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers). So, how many blocks is that? From 1-99: 1 block, 100-199: another, 200-299: another, 300-399: another, and 400-488: another. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488: 440-449 is only 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 4's in tens place: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, which means 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. Now, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Let's count the number of 8's in each place. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, but 488 is included, so how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the partial cycle from 481-488, the units digit is 8 at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Let's count: From 1-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers (480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488). So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total in tens place: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 10+10=20, +10=30, +10=40, +9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149), totaling 50 times across all blocks.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189), with an additional 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So, starting at 4, each step is +10. The number of terms can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the last one, so from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the incomplete block from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which is the second digit from the right. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place, which is the third digit from the right. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many times. The first is 8, last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 80-89 is one, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, 400-488: does 480-489 exist? 488 is the last page, so 480-488 would be the range, but 489 is beyond 488, so the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but in the tens place, 8 is in the second digit. So, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0-8. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the hundreds place (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges? Let me list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9\n\nSo, that's 4 full ranges and one partial. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 4 appears 188 times, and 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for 8, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, 50 is correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place (1s place):** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens Place (10s place):** The digit 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place (100s place):** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears 49 times (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges and a partial range (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 doesn't appear as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we're dealing with whole numbers, I can take the integer part, which is 48, and then add 1 because the first occurrence is at 4. Wait, no, actually, when counting how many times a digit appears in the units place up to a certain number, the formula is usually (number // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Let me think. For example, up to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4 is in the ones place, which is every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, there are 488 // 10 = 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that's 48 complete decades, and then in the 489th set, which is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last set only goes up to 488. So, in the 480s, the units place 4 appears once at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last set is 481-488, so the units digit 4 appears once in that set at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (484) = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, 140-149 is another 10. Then 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, how many ranges? From 40-49: 10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 50 in total for the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the 489th set (481-490), but we only go up to 488, so 488 is included, which is 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences, and the last partial range contributes 9 (480-488). So, let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but wait, let me check the tens place for 8's again. I think I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place 8's. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, the ranges are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial (9). So, 4*10=40 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, right? So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, the count for 8's in the tens place is indeed 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, we have 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the 440-449 range, does 449 exist? Since the book is 488 pages, yes, 449 is within 488. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me check the hundreds place for 4's: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. Correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the units place of 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, n-1 = (484-4)/10 = 480/10=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, so n= (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: starting from 4, adding 10 each time, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, when does 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484? Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are up to 488. - The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. - Then 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. Now, 488 is beyond 449, so the next block would be 540-549, but that's beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, how many blocks do we have? Five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up the 4's from each place: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's. Wait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, that seems right. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. Using the same method as before: nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488 \u2192 (n-1)*10 = 480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many such blocks are within 488. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, we have four blocks contributing 10 each, except the last one which contributes 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, let me check that. From 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, meaning there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th such number because 4 + (48-1)*10 = 484. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 exceed 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are valid. So, 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. Wait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5*10=50. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me do the same for 8. I'll go through each digit position again: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but wait, 488 is included, so that would be 49 times. Wait, let me check: starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one more. So, 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 480-489 would be 10, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total for tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 48 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to include 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, each 10 pages contribute one 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is included, it's actually 49 times? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th occurrence after 4. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) = 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 480-488. In that group, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many times. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But 488 is included, so that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count the number of ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 ranges. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, but the last one, 480-488, contributes 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, for the first four ranges, 4 * 10 = 40, and the last range has 9. So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 89. Wait, that's 89 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the 4's: Units place: from 4, 14, 24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, which is correct? Let's see: starting at 4, each step is +10, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48 as I previously thought. So, that's a mistake I made earlier. Similarly, for 8's in units place, I had 49, which is correct because 8,18,...,488 is 49 numbers. So, correcting the 4's count: units place is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. So, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's are 188. For 8's, units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds is 0. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, so I initially thought 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it's 90. Let me check again: 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.

That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last one is 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, how many numbers ending with 8? It's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many blocks. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the 8 in the tens place occurs 10 times in each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.), and 9 times in the last block (480-488). So, total in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking number of 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. Total: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems right. Number of 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. Total: 49+49=98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Yes, that's correct. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. For the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4x10=40, plus the last block 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. That's correct. Units place: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. So, 187-98=89. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. That seems right. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, 4 full blocks and a partial one, totaling 49. So, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. This totals 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."
