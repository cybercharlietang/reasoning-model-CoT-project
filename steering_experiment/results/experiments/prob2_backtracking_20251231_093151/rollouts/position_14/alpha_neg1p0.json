    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 0. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 + 1) // 10, which is (489) // 10 = 48.9, so 48 times. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to a number N is given by floor(N / 10) if the digit is not zero. But since we're starting from 1, maybe it's better to think of it as (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= 4 else 0). Wait, no, that's for a specific digit. Let me think differently. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in that group, 484 is the only number with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, the last group is 480-488. In that group, 488 is the only number with an 8 in the units place, so yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, but the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in tens place. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the number of 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. That seems right. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48 + 49 = 97. 187 - 97 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. I said 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. That's 4*10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct. And for 4's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10 = 50. That's correct. And in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 187 total 4's. 8's: 48 in units, 49 in tens, so 97. 187 - 97 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, taking the integer part).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 ranges \u00d7 10 + 9 (for 480-488) = 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrence since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 4, each 10 pages add another 4. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be every 100 numbers, for 10 numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. However, we need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's calculate each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 4 is the first. Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 / 10 = 48, plus 1 gives 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is included. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But 488 is the last page, so up to 488, how many 4's in units place? Let me think differently. For each ten numbers, there's one 4 in the units place. So from 1-488, how many tens? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? 488's units digit is 8, so no. The last 4 in units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, I'm confused. Let me think: from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (10s) plus one if the units digit is >=4 in the incomplete decade. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in each digit position. Let me try again. For units place: Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit goes up to 8, which is less than 10, so the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is 48*10 + 4. So, yes, 48 times. Wait, but from 1-10: 4 once, 11-20: 14, so another, etc. So, 48 times. So units place: 48 4's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, tens digit 4. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is higher than 449, so that's fine. So, tens place: 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, hundreds place: 89 4's. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit is 8, so that's included. So, from 1-488, the number of 8's in units place is 49? Wait, because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the hundreds place (480-489) would only go up to 488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? The first three ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4 ranges? Wait, no, 80-89 is the first, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four ranges, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, 380-389 is within 488, so that's fine. Now, the next range would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 from the first four ranges and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, tens place: 40 +9=49 8's. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 8's. Now, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. So, 98 8's. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:98. The difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place:48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, +89=187. Correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct. And the hundreds place for 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, correct. So, yes, the difference is 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the tens place for ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\) (since 488 is included).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - 8 appears in the tens place for ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.  \n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**  \n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 484 count as the last one? Yes, because 484 + 10 = 494, which is beyond 488. So, 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Oh, I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times for the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so each contributes 10 4's. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. The total number here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488, which is the 488th page. So, how many such numbers? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480, 481,...,488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 4 full ranges (each contributing 10) and one partial range contributing 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9 =49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many complete blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, so that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another block, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. The number of such numbers is from 400 to 488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, that's 48 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so actually, it's 488//10 + 1? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. The first occurrence is 8, which is 1*8, the second is 18, which is 2*8, and so on. The last occurrence is 488, which is 488/10 = 48.8, but since we're counting full tens, it's 48 times. Wait, no, actually, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Let's count how many blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 0. Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place up to 488. Let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that seems correct because 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484, so n = (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me calculate how many such groups there are. Each group has 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's a group where the tens digit is 4. From 1 to 488, we have four hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last group is 440-449 and 450-459, etc., but I need to be careful here. Let me think: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Okay, so 188 4's.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. Let's find how many numbers end with 8 up to 488. The sequence is 8, 18, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. Let's calculate how many such groups there are. The first four groups are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 numbers. The last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in tens place: 4 groups *10 + 9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 groups: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full groups (80-89, etc.) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in numbers ending with 4, such as 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because starting from 0, 484 is the 49th multiple of 10. Hmm, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's floor(488/10) = 48, because 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, 484 is included, so that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 89 times. Wait, no, actually, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, we'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so only 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total for tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, total 8's are 97. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the tens place for 8's. I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, yes, 49. For 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct because 440-449 is within 400-488, so it's a full 10 numbers. So, yes, 50. And in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 97. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers.

But wait, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so actually, the count is 48.4, but since we can't have a fraction, maybe it's 48? Wait, let me think again. If I take the floor of 488 divided by 10, that would give me the number of complete decades. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, there are 48 numbers where the units digit is 4.

Well, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 450-488 would have tens digits of 5-8, so only up to 449. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50. Wait, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 400-488 is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. 100-199: 140-149: 10. 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349: 10. 400-488: 440-449: 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187. Wait, but wait, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: the first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so let's check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different from before. Because when I did 4's, I had 48 in the units place, but for 8's, it's 49. Let me confirm: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + 10(n-1) = 488. Solving for n: 10(n-1) = 480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many numbers have 8 in the tens place.\n\n- 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, because 480 is included, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers, as I thought. So, 10 each in the first four centuries (0-99, 100-199, etc.) and 9 in 400-488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 8's because 488 is included, so the last 8 in units is 488, which is the 49th term. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each century (0-99, 100-199, etc.) contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so only 9 numbers. So, 4 times 10 plus 9 is 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place was 0, so total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 numbers (4,14,...,484). Since 484 is the last one, which is 48*10 + 4, so 48 numbers.\n\n- Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 numbers (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 numbers (8,18,...,488).\n\n- Tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the hundreds place doesn't contribute anything because the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for 4's, I had 48 numbers, but for 8's, it's 49. That makes sense because 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears one more time.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 8's have 49, while 4's have 50. So, the 4's have one more in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 187, 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the units place for 4's was 48, but for 8's it's 49. That makes sense because 488 is included, so the 8's have an extra count in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49, so 4's have one more there as well.\n\nSo, overall, 4's have 187 and 8's have 98, so 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the 4's in the tens place. Each century has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place, and there are five centuries up to 488: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. But in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only up to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 each for five centuries, so 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, each of the first four centuries (0-99, 100-199, etc.) have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, but the fifth century (400-488) only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, the total 4's are 187, 8's are 98, so 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nIn the tens place, 50 4's.\n\nIn the units place, 48 4's.\n\nTotal: 89 + 50 = 139 + 48 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** \n     - The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n     - The number of such occurrences is calculated by dividing 484 by 10, which gives 48.4. Taking the integer part, we get 48 occurrences.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - However, in the last block (400-488), the tens digit '4' only appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n     - Total occurrences: 5 * 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n     - The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n     - The number of such occurrences is calculated by considering the last occurrence at 488, which is the 49th term.\n     - Total occurrences: 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 occurrences. There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - In the last block (400-488), the tens digit '8' appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n     - Total occurrences: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at page 488.\n     - Total occurrences: 0.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 187\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). Each full cycle (10 numbers) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 cycles give 48 fours. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place here. So total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? From 1-100, 10 numbers (40-49). From 101-200, another 10 (140-149). Similarly, 201-300: 240-249 (10 numbers), 301-400: 340-349 (10 numbers). Then, 401-488: here, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 more. So how many blocks? Let's see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, 48 +1=49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check: from 1 to 480, it's 480/10=48 eights. Then, 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8. So yes, 49 eights in units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n101-200: 180-189 (10)\n201-300: 280-289 (10)\n301-400: 380-389 (10)\n401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so in the last block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights.\n\nSo total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's:187, total 8's:98. The difference is 187-98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4 in the units place. In the last 8 numbers (481-488), there's no additional 4. Total: 48.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400) contributing 10 each, and one more set (440-449) in 401-488. Total: 4*10 +10=50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total:89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 +50 +89=187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 488). Total:49.\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, and the last partial hundred (401-488) contributes 9 (480-488). Total:4*10 +9=49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total:0.\n   - **Total 8's:**49 +49 +0=98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's:187 -98=89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 484 count as the last 4 in the units place? Let me check: 484 is indeed within 488, so yes, 48 is correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 would be up to 449, and since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 488. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first. Wait, let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to how many times 8 is the last digit up to 488. So, 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is given by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 480-489 range would only go up to 488. So, how many numbers in 480-488 where the tens digit is 8? Wait, no, the tens digit in 480-489 is 8 in the tens place. So, 480-489 would have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, let me clarify. The tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, for example, 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, etc., up to 489, which would be 10 numbers. But since the book only goes up to 488, the 489th page doesn't exist. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, the ranges are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total in the tens place is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times. Wait, that seems off because earlier I thought 8's would be less than 4's, but let me double-check. Wait, no, 4's were 187, 8's are 98, so 187 -98=89 more 4's. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 8's again. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The last term is 488. So, the number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 8's total 98. 4's total 187. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check again because I might have missed something. For the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. For the 4's in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 48 times. So, 89+50+48=187. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 48 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 484 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, plus 1 gives 481 numbers. Wait, no, that's not right. Because every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete sets of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set ends at 480, and then we have 481 to 488, which is 8 more numbers. In those 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, starting at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. So, from 8 to 488, how many numbers? The formula is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 8}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 0. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the integer part is 48, but since we include both endpoints, it's 49. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades. Each decade contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last decade is 480-488, which includes 484, so that's correct. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (40s), 140-149 (140s), 240-249 (240s), 340-349 (340s), and 440-449 (440s). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. The first is 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and 488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since the book ends at 488, the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So, how many? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but earlier for 4's, I thought it was 48, but here it's 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: For 4's in the units place, the last occurrence is at 484, which is 48*10 + 4 = 484. So, 48 occurrences. For 8's, the last occurrence is at 488, which is 48*10 + 8 = 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences. So, units place for 8's is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 in the tens place appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 ranges with 10 numbers and 1 range with 9. So total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the units place, I had 48, but for 8's, I had 49. Is that correct? Let's see: For 4's, the last page with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48*10 +4=484, so 48 occurrences. For 8's, the last page with an 8 in the units place is 488, which is 48*10 +8=488, so 49 occurrences. So that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 numbers. 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89. So that's correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, yes, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when counting the units place for 4's, I had 48, but for 8's, I had 49. So, 48 vs 49. That's a difference of 1 already.\n\nThen, in the tens place, 50 vs 49. So, 50-49=1.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 vs 0. So, 89-0=89.\n\nAdding up the differences:1 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=91. Wait, but that contradicts my earlier total difference of 89. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the total counts.\n\nWait, no. The total counts are 187 (4's) and 98 (8's). The difference is 187-98=89. So, that's correct. The individual digit positions contribute to the total counts, but the overall difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. For example, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449 is 10 numbers, all within 488. So, correct. For 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit position, calculate the number of 4's and 8's, then sum them up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's = floor(488/10) =48. But since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so it's 48 +1=49? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the formula is:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but that's for a specific digit. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.\n\nActually, for the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is floor(488/10)=48, because every 10 numbers contribute one 4. But since 488 is 48*10 +8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 48*10 +4, so 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, it's floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place, so 48 +1=49 times.\n\nWait, so maybe my initial count was correct: 48 for 4's, 49 for 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: floor(488/100)=4, because 488//100=4. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 4*10=40. But wait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes another set where the tens digit is 4 (440-449). So, that's an additional 10, making it 5*10=50. So, correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total is 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 is less than 1000, we look at the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place: 0, since 488 < 800.\n\nSo, total 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades, each contributing one '4'. The last occurrence is at 484, so 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n   Total '4's = 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** '8' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (since 488 is included).\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 10 each, and the last range 480-488 contributes 9. Total = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' never appears since the book ends at 488.\n\n   Total '8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence. Hmm, actually, maybe a better way is to calculate how many full tens are there in 488. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place, which is indeed 48 times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 440-449 is within 488. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is beyond 449, so it's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check each range. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the 8 in the tens place occurs 9 times. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48+49=97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so that's correct. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which we take the integer part as 48. So, 48 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Wait, but 488 is beyond 400, so do we have another range? No, because 480-489 would be the next, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, so that's 5 ranges, but the last one only has 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, it's 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each with 10, and one partial range with 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, the digit 8 appears 97 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units 48, tens 49, hundreds 0. 48+49=97. 187-97=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, in the tens place for 8's, I considered 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) each with 10, and the last one (480-488) as 9. So 4*10=40 +9=49. That's correct. And for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, yes, 89. So, the difference is 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe digit 4 appears 187 times, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is (last term - first term)/common difference + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but does 488 count? No, because 488 is beyond 484, and we're only considering the units place here. So, 49 is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers in each hundred. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is 440, and 449 is 449. So, that's 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 5*10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 is correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The last page is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so integer part is 48. But using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range. Let's count each hundred. From 80-89: 10 numbers. From 180-189: 10. From 280-289: 10. From 380-389: 10. From 480-488: how many? 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, total in the tens place is 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, which is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last range contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the range 800-899 exist.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so that's correct. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would go up to 449, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is still within the page numbers. Let me count how many ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's the first range. Then each subsequent hundred has another range. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges in total. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 1-488. 449 is less than 488, so yes. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 4's. Wait, but actually, each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, 48 + 1? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, let me think again. The first occurrence is 8, which is 1*10 - 2. The last occurrence is 488, which is 48*10 + 8. So, the number of 8's in the units place is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. Wait, that seems off. Alternatively, think of it as for each ten, there's one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 48 full tens (1-480), and then 481-488. In each full ten, there's one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in 481-488, there's another 8 at 488. So, total 48 +1=49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except possibly the last one. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total 4 ranges with 10 each and one range with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10 numbers.\n   - Range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (since pages go up to 488).\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 0 \\).\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is indeed the last one in the units place. So, 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 10 per hundred. Let's calculate how many hundreds we have. From 1-488, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of the first four hundreds, the 40-49 range contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 4 for 400-409, but wait, 400-409 is actually the hundreds place as 4, but the tens place is 0-09. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. When considering the tens place, it's the second digit. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place are 4*10 (from 40-49 in each hundred) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but since 488 is included, that's 49 occurrences. Wait, because 8 is the first occurrence at 8, which is 1*8, and 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 times. Let me check: from 1-488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one. Let's see: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? For each hundred (except the last partial hundred), the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in 1-400, that's 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place: 4*10=40. Now, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since our book goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, taking the integer part).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (including 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, I need to make sure that 488 is included if necessary. Let me check: 484 is the last number in the units place with a 4 before 488. So, yes, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, I'm only concerned about the hundreds digit being 4. So, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many that is. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 8, so that's included. So, 48 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range contributes 10 numbers. Let's count the ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10. That's 4 ranges, so 4*10=40 occurrences. Wait, but 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, the range is 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, for 480-488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the earlier ranges) + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (48) + tens (49) = 48 + 49 = 97. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. Now, 8's: units:48, tens:49, so 97. 187-97=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the tens place, the ranges are 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So that's correct. So, 49 in tens place. Units place: 48. So, total 8's: 48+49=97. 4's:187. 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Hmm, so there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 484 is 484, so 484 is the 49th number. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many full ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many hundreds are there? Up to 488, so we have 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in the tens place, 4 can appear in each of the hundreds except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, in 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. In 100-199: 140-149: 10. In 200-299: 240-249:10. In 300-399:340-349:10. In 400-488: 440-449:10, because 449 is less than 488, so that's another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 5 ranges each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last occurrence is at 488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. Let me count each range: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)= 98 times. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Taking the integer part, that's 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 is another 10, 340-349 is another 10, and 440-449 is another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, when we reach 440-449, that's 10 numbers, but the next range would be 540-549, which is beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, 5 ranges, 10 each, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts for each place: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, the first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. To find how many, I can calculate 488 / 10 = 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so actually, it's 49 times because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. The first occurrence is 8, which is 8*1, then 18 is 8*2, up to 488, which is 8*61, because 8*61 = 488. So, that's 61 occurrences. Wait, that seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. Hmm, so that's 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the counts for each place: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times for 1-480, plus one more for 484, making it 49 times. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by dividing N by 10 and taking the integer part, then adding 1 if the units digit is >= the target digit. Wait, maybe I should use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 10 - d)/10). Let me test this. For N=488, d=4: floor((488 + 10 - 4)/10) = floor(494/10) = floor(49.4) = 49. So, 49 times in the units place for 4's. Similarly, for 8's: floor((488 + 10 - 8)/10) = floor(490/10) = 49. So, 49 times in the units place for 8's. Wait, that's the same. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake because 488 is the upper limit, so maybe I should adjust. Let me check with a smaller number. Suppose N=14. How many 4's in units place? 4,14: that's 2 times. Using the formula: floor((14 + 10 -4)/10) = floor(20/10)=2. Correct. So, the formula works. So, for 4's in units place: 49 times. For 8's: floor((488 +10 -8)/10)=floor(490/10)=49. So, 49 times. So, same number in units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, moving to the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many full decades are there where the tens digit is 4? From 40-49: 10 numbers, 40-49. Similarly, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total number of 4's in the tens place is 5 sets of 10, which is 50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contributing 10. So, 5*10=50. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49 times. So, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49. So, 4's have 50, 8's have 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. For 8's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, let's sum up the counts. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total 4's = 49+50+89= 188. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total 8's=49+49=98. Now, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because we start counting from 0. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is 10. Wait, but 488 is less than 450, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, is 440-449 entirely within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's similar to the 4's. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, but wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10. Wait, no, because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so actually, it's 49 times. Wait, no, let me think again. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48*10=480, so 480 is the last number in the 48th decade. Then, 488 is in the next decade, which is 481-490, but 488 is within 480-489, so actually, the units digit 8 occurs once in each decade, so 48 times from 1 to 480, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is the 49th number where the units digit is 8. Because 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is 10. From 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, no, let me recount: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4 times 10 is 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. The last one is 484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The nth term is 10n -6, where n starts at 1. Wait, actually, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me recount. If the first occurrence is 4 (n=1), then 14 (n=2), ..., 484 (n=49). So, 49 times. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Similarly, for the 8's in the units place, I had 49, which is correct. So, let me correct the 4's count. Units place for 4's: 49 times. Tens place for 4's: 50 times (as before). Hundreds place for 4's: 89 times. So, total 49+50+89=188. Wait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Now, for the 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, so earlier I had 187-98=89, but now I'm getting 188-98=90. Which one is correct? Let me check again. Units place for 4's: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, I was wrong earlier when I said 48; it's actually 49. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I thought it was 5 sets: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. 8's: units=49, tens=49, so 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct. So, 89. So, yes, 4's total 188, 8's 98, difference 90. So, the answer is 90. But wait, let me check the 8's in the tens place again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 in tens place. Units place:49, so total 98. So, yes, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 numbers where 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 484 is the last one, so 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 include 484? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, 48 times is correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence in the units place is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, giving 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so let me check: 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no. Because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, but 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,..., 488. So, how many numbers is that? Let me calculate how many numbers between 1 and 488 are congruent to 8 mod 10. That's floor((488 - 8)/10) + 1. So, (488 - 8) = 480, 480/10 = 48, so 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. So, units place for 8 is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: Does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, the range is 480-488. So, that's a partial range. Each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40. Then, the partial range 480-488 has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place has 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 48+50=98, +89=187. That seems correct. Now, for the 8's: units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, so the answer would be 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges is 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 40+9=49. That's correct. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98. So, yes, 187-98=89.

Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many full ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, making it 20. Then 240-249: 30. 340-349: 40. Now, 440-449: that's 50. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. There are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but each of the first four ranges (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 numbers each with 4 in the tens place. The last range, 400-488, has 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then 480-488, but wait, 480-488 has 8 numbers where the tens digit is 8, but we're looking for 4 in the tens place. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) + 10 (240-249) + 10 (340-349) + 10 (440-449) = 50. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 488 is 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers except the last one, which might be cut short. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Now, 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

But wait, let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. However, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, that's 48 times. But wait, 484 is the 48th number, but does 484 count as the 48th occurrence? Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times. So, 48 times 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, in blocks of 10. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.

From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's floor(488/10) = 48 times. But wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48, but the last number with 8 in units place is 488, which is the 48th occurrence because 488 = 48*10 + 8. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, because 480-489 would be 10, but 488 is the last page). So, let's calculate: the first four blocks (0-399) each have 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40. The last block (400-488) has 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digits can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, total 8's: 97. Now, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, that can't be right because I think I might have made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me double-check. For 4's in the tens place: from 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That seems correct. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 in tens place. Then, units place: 48. Hundreds place: 89. So, 48+50=98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units place: 48. Tens place: 40 (from 0-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49. So, 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Wait, but I think I might have missed something in the 8's tens place. Let me check again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9. So, total tens place for 8's is 40+9=49. So, 48+49=97. So, the difference is 187-97=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me think again. For 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. Correct. For 8's in the hundreds place: none, because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 0. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's: 48 (units) +49 (tens)=97. So, 187-97=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such groups there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last group is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. How many such groups are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 groups. Each group contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Wait, but let me check: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers? Yes, 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is included, so does that mean 49 times? Wait, let me think: from 8 to 488, how many numbers with 8 in units place? The formula is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. Wait, no. Because 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 8's. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let me see how many such groups there are. Each group is 10 numbers. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. Wait, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, how many groups? Let's count: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 groups of 10 and 1 group of 9. So, total in tens place: (4*10) +9=40+9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think it's 48 times, but wait, 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Let me check: 4, 14, 24,..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many sets of 100 there are. From 1-488, there are 4 hundreds (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s). In each hundred, the 40-49 range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for the 100s, 200s, 300s, that's 3 sets, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30. Now, in the 400s, we have 400-449 and 450-488. Wait, but 400-449 is the 400s, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit being 4 would be from 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. Wait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, etc. So in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, because 400-409 have a tens digit of 0, 410-419 have tens digit 1, and so on. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. When the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 0-9, so the 40-49 in the tens place would be from 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 when the number is 440-449. So, in the 400s, how many numbers have a tens digit of 4? From 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers. So, for the 400s, that's 10. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. Now, let's count for each hundred: 100s: 140-149: 10 numbers. 200s: 240-249: 10 numbers. 300s: 340-349: 10 numbers. 400s: 440-449: 10 numbers. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. But wait, 400s go up to 488, so 440-449 is within that. So, 40 in total for the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought maybe only 3 sets, but no, it's 4 sets because 400s are included. So, 40 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Wait, but we're only counting how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, each of those 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 40, hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 = 178. So, total number of 4's is 178. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, but 488 is the 49th term. So, from 8 to 488, that's 49 numbers. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, we have 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So total is 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds digit is 8 zero times. So, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 178, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 178 - 98 = 80. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's or 8's. Let's recount the 4's. Units place: from 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: in each hundred (100s,200s,300s,400s), the tens digit is 4 in 10 numbers each. So 4*10=40. Correct. Hundreds place: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89. So total 49+40+89=178. Correct. Now for 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 488=8 + (n-1)*10 => 488=8+10n-10 => 488=10n -2 => 10n=490 => n=49. So 49 times. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total 8's:49+49=98. So, 178-98=80. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 hundreds (100s, 200s, 300s, 400s).\n   - Total: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **178**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 numbers, except the 400s which contribute 9.\n   - Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n178 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **80**.\n\n$\\boxed{80}$"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is within 488, so 484 is included. So, 48 seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many numbers are in each of these ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, hundreds digits are 0,1,2,3,4. That's 5 sets. But wait, for the tens digit, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 4, but the units can go up to 88. So, for the range 440-449, that's 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, each hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.) up to 400-488 will have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds? Let's see: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, except maybe the last set, 400-488. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 4, but the units can go up to 88, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, yes, each of the 5 sets contributes 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be 4, but the units digit goes up to 88, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets x 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488, which is included. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let's see: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each range. Each hundred (except maybe the last one) will have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, the counts are: 10 (for 80-89) + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference is 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 4,14,...,484. How many numbers? 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, but 484 is the 48th multiple plus 4. Wait, actually, the number of terms is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, and 488 ends with 8, not 4, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48th term. So, 48 is correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 5 sets of 10, which is 50. That seems right. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units place: 49 numbers, because 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th term. Tens place: 49 numbers, as calculated. So, 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens. But actually, 484 is the 49th number because starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds one more. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10). So, floor(488/10) = 48. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, contributing 10 numbers. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) plus 88 pages. Wait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-400) plus 88 pages. So, in each hundred, there's one block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, 488 is beyond 400, so we have an additional 88 pages. Do these 88 pages include another block where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 400-488. The tens digit in 400-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, and so on up to 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 (from 1-400) + 1 (from 440-449) = 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many 4's is that? Each number contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many? Using the same formula: floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor(488/10) = 48, but 488 is the 49th number. Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10, but the units digit is 8, so from 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's the same as floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 is included. Wait, let me think again. The number of numbers with units digit 8 from 1 to n is floor((n + 1)/10). So, for n=488, (488 +1)/10=489/10=48.9, so floor is 48. So, 48 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so maybe it's 48 or 49? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place. This occurs in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, let's count how many full blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the following ranges: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me confirm. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 40+9=49. So, tens place 8's:49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's:0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me verify the 4's again: units place:48, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. Yes, that seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. I had 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, but since 488 is included, does that add one more? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence in the units place for 8's, but for 4's, the last occurrence in the units place is 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so floor is 48. So, 48 times. Wait, but when I did the 8's, I had 49 because 488 is included. So, for 4's, the units place is 48, and for 8's, it's 49. That seems correct. So, yes, the difference is 89. I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Number of 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: floor((488 + 1)/10) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - The partial range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Number of 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, let me check: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But actually, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last number with a 4 in the units place. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers? Let's see: 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, which means 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, starting from 4, the first number is 4, which is 4 + 10*0. The next is 14, which is 4 + 10*1, and so on until 484, which is 4 + 10*48 = 484. So, that's 49 numbers, right? Because 0 to 48 is 49 numbers. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. The number of 4's in the units place would be the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. For each ten numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, that would be 48, but we have an extra 8 numbers in the last incomplete group (481-488). So, in the units place of the last group, we have 484, which is the 484th page, so that's another 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because from 1 to 480, it's 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 484 as the 4 in the units place, so that's one more, making it 49. So, total 4's in the units place: 49.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number. Let's say up to 14. So, pages 1-14. The 4's in the units place are 4 and 14, so that's 2. 14 divided by 10 is 1.4, so 1 complete group, which would be 1, but we have 2 because 14 is included. So, the formula should be floor((n + 1)/10). Wait, let me think. For n=14, floor((14 + 1)/10) = floor(15/10) = 1, but we have 2 4's. Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Since every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but then we check if the last number is beyond 480, which it is (488), so we add 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, 488's units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, but 540-549 would be beyond, so we don't have that. So, how many such decades are there? Let's see:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nBut wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets of 10 numbers each, contributing 10 4's in the tens place each. So, 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 0-99, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Then 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. Again, checking units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nUnits place: 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many 8's in the units place? Let's calculate.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But we need to check if the last number is beyond 480. 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's an extra. So, 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, same as 4's in the units place, we have 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it.\n\nSo, each of these decades contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such decades are there:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four decades contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, I had 49, which includes the 480-488 as 9 numbers. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 8's in the units place again. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 is included, so that's one more. So, total 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the units place, same logic: 49.\n\nWait, but for the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 >=4, we add 1, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10 >=8, we add 1, so 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + min(max(488%100 -40 +1,0),10). Wait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is determined by how many complete hundreds are there and the remainder.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400). So, 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. That matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: number of complete hundreds is 4, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (80-89, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, total 40+9=49. That matches.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different, but maybe 90 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with a smaller number to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 14 pages.\n\nCounting 4's and 8's.\n\nPage numbers:1-14.\n\n4's:4,14. So, two 4's.\n\n8's:8. So, one 8.\n\nDifference:2-1=1.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: floor(14/10)=1, and since 14 mod 10 >=4, add 1: total 2.\n\n8's: floor(14/10)=1, and since 14 mod10 >=8, add 1: total 2.\n\nWait, but in reality, 8's are only one (page 8). So, my method overcounts. Hmm, maybe my method isn't accurate for small numbers, but works for larger ones?\n\nWait, in the units place for 14:\n\n4 appears at 4 and 14: two times.\n\n8 appears at 8 and 18, but 18 is beyond 14, so only once.\n\nSo, my method counts 2 8's, but actually only one. So, my method is incorrect for 8's in the units place when the last group doesn't reach the next multiple.\n\nWait, so maybe I need to adjust my formula. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = floor(n / 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, for d=4, n=14:\n\nfloor(14/10)=1, and since 14%10=4 >=4, so count=1+1=2. Correct.\n\nFor d=8, n=14:\n\nfloor(14/10)=1, and since 14%10=4 <8, so count=1+0=1. Correct.\n\nAh, so my earlier mistake was that I added 1 even when the remainder was less than d. So, the correct formula is:\n\ncount_units = floor(n / 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly for tens place:\n\nFor digit d in the tens place, the count is:\n\ncount_tens = floor(n / 100) * 10 + min(max(n % 100 - d*10 +1, 0),10)\n\nWait, let me test this with n=14 and d=4.\n\nfloor(14/100)=0, so 0*10=0.\n\nn%100=14.\n\n14 -4*10 +1=14-40+1= -25, which is less than 0, so min(0,10)=0.\n\nSo, total count_tens=0+0=0. But in reality, from 1-14, the tens digit is 4 only in 40-49, which is beyond 14, so 0. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place, n=14:\n\nfloor(14/100)=0.\n\nn%100=14.\n\n14 -8*10 +1=14-80+1= -65, so min(0,10)=0. So, count_tens=0. Correct, since 80-89 is beyond 14.\n\nWait, but in my earlier example, n=14, d=8, units place: count=1, which is correct.\n\nSo, perhaps my formula works if I apply it correctly.\n\nLet me try n=88.\n\nCounting 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4: floor(88/10)=8, and 88%10=8 >=4, so 8+1=9.\n\nFor 8: floor(88/10)=8, and 88%10=8 >=8, so 8+1=9.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4: floor(88/100)=0, so 0*10=0.\n\nn%100=88.\n\n88 -4*10 +1=88-40+1=49. Min(49,10)=10.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the formula is min(max(n%100 -d*10 +1, 0),10). So, for d=4, n=88:\n\n88%100=88.\n\n88 -40 +1=49.\n\nmax(49,0)=49.\n\nmin(49,10)=10.\n\nSo, count_tens=0 +10=10.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-88, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nfloor(88/100)=0.\n\n88%100=88.\n\n88 -80 +1=9.\n\nmax(9,0)=9.\n\nmin(9,10)=9.\n\nSo, count_tens=0 +9=9.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-88, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-88, which is 9 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (9) + tens (10) + hundreds (0)=19.\n\nTotal 8's: units (9) + tens (9) + hundreds (0)=18.\n\nDifference:19-18=1.\n\nWhich is correct because from 1-88, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nSo, my formula seems to work.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, n=488.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48, 488%10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nn%100=88.\n\n88 -40 +1=49.\n\nmax(49,0)=49.\n\nmin(49,10)=10.\n\nSo, count_tens=40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 488 >=400, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488.\n\nSo, count_hundreds=488-400 +1=89.\n\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10)=48, 488%10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nn%100=88.\n\n88 -80 +1=9.\n\nmax(9,0)=9.\n\nmin(9,10)=9.\n\nSo, count_tens=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0, and since 488 <800, no hundreds digit 8.\n\nTotal 8's=49+49=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using the formula for each digit position.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if (488%10 >=4) else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/10) + (1 if (488%10 >=8) else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + min(max(488%100 -40 +1,0),10)=4*10 + min(49,10)=40+10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)*10 + min(max(488%100 -80 +1,0),10)=4*10 + min(9,10)=40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: if 400 <=488, then 488-400 +1=89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 800>488.\n\nSo, total 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference=188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked enough, so the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 numbers where 4 appears in the units place. Wait, but let me check. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? The number of terms in the sequence 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times, not 48. Because when you divide 484 by 10, you get 48.4, but since we start at 4, which is 480/10 + 0.4, so the count is actually 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me calculate how many numbers that is. Each set of 10 numbers (like 40-49) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such sets are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in 100 pages, there's one set of 10 numbers with the tens digit as 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens digit 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's calculate how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so per hundred, there's one set. From 1-488, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.) and then 88 pages. In each full hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4 sets, 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, so 8+1=9. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488.

Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49 (which is within 1-488), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So 5 blocks * 10 = 50. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. Let me count the blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4*10 = 40. Wait, but does 380-389 fall within 488? Yes, because 389 is less than 488. So, 4 blocks, 40 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. So, 89 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 89 (8's) = 99. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For the 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For the 8's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0. 49+40=89. 188-89=99. Hmm, but wait a second, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but does that include the hundreds digit as 4? Yes, because 400 is the first number where the hundreds digit is 4, and 488 is the last. So that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I considered 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For the units place of 4's, from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time, which gives 49 numbers. Similarly for 8's, units place from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, which is 49 numbers. Tens place for 8's: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, which is 4 blocks, so 40 numbers. So, yes, 89 eights. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is exactly 484, so 484/10 is 48.4, but since 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, so actually, there are 49 numbers where 4 is in the units place. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated by N divided by 10, taking the floor of that, plus 1 if the units digit is >=4. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are, and then see if the last group has a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488) would be 481-488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be every block of 100, starting at 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 440-449. Let's count how many full blocks there are. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, let me confirm. Each block is 100 numbers, and in each, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many such blocks are there? The first block is 40-49, which is in 1-99. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So, tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That would be from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's. The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place would be in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Let's count how many such blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, the last block contributes 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks \u00d710 + 1 block \u00d79 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the 4's again: Units place: 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4, plus one more in the last group (484), so 49. Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 49+50+89=188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 48 groups, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), each contributing 10, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488: 48 groups, contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10 in 488: 48 groups, contributing 48 eights.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - The last block (400-488) includes 480-488, contributing 9 numbers.\n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because 4 is the first one. Let me check that: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48 intervals, so 49 numbers. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 48 full groups (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8), so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does the 440-449 range go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so it's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. So, all numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. Starting from 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, which gives 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me check: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, that's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place. So, ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -98=89. Wait, that's a big number. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=48+50=98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last number where 4 is in the units place. So, that would be 48 occurrences. Wait, let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. It should be 49 times. Because from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers add one 4 in the units place, and 484 is the 49th term. 2. **Tens place:** Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, from 400-488, the next range after 440-449 would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, does 480-488 count? Wait, no, because the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, not 4. So, the tens digit being 4 in the 400s is only 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the counts from each place: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the counts for 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total number of 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so actually, it's 48 times plus one more? Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a block of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, in 1-100: 40-49 (10 numbers). 101-200: 140-149 (10). 201-300: 240-249 (10). 301-400: 340-349 (10). 401-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, only the hundreds digit is 4 here, so each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8. So, how many? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9). So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts counting from 4 as the first. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, it's 48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but the units digit of 488 is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of complete groups of 10. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is within 1-99. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? From 40-49 (1 range), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50.

From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.

The last one is 488, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing an 8. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488)\n\nWait, but in the tens place, it's the second digit. So, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers because 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, etc., up to 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 8's, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 numbers, same for 180-189, etc. But 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, for the tens place, we have:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, total 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but each of these contributes one 8 in the tens place per number. So, 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: from 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total 10*4 +9 =49.\n\nSo, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 49 in units and 49 in tens, so total 98. Let me confirm units place again: from 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? The first term is 8, the last is 488. The difference between terms is 10, so number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nTens place: as above, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier when counting 4's, I had 187 4's. So, 187 -98=89. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187-98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the difference is 187-98=89.\n\nTherefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences for the first four ranges and 9 for the last (480-488).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 48*10 = 480, but 484 is 484, so maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete tens. So, 48 times 4 appears in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10, and in each set, one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the 489th page? No, wait, the pages go from 1 to 488, so 488 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, each full ten contributes one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place there. So, total units place 4's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 +1 = 49? Wait, no, because in each full ten, it's 8,18,...,488. Wait, 488 is the 489th page? No, the last page is 488, so 488 is included. So, the units digit 8 appears in 8,18,...,488. How many terms? The number of terms is given by the number of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Let's see: The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers (80-89) \u2192 10 8's in the tens place. - 180-189: 10 numbers \u2192 10 8's. - 280-289: 10 numbers \u2192 10 8's. - 380-389: 10 numbers \u2192 10 8's. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488) \u2192 9 8's in the tens place because 488 is included. So, total tens place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full sets, so 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: ((488 - 8) \u00f7 10) + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 800-899, so 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 49th occurrence because it starts at 4 (which is the first). Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles and a partial one. Each full cycle contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Let me see: the units digit cycles 0-9, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? The number of times is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any extra in the last partial decade. The number of complete decades is floor(488 / 10) = 48. Each complete decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Now, in the last partial decade, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 fall within this? Yes, 484 is within 480-488, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the last complete decade is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the units digits go up to 8. So, in 480-488, the units digits are 0-8, so 484 is included, so yes, one more. So units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first range is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Now, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: 10. 240-249:10. 340-349:10. 440-449:10. So that's 50. So tens place 4's: 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 4's: 89. Now, total 4's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. The number of times is floor(488 / 10) = 48 full decades, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial decade, from 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8 in the units place. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So 8 in the hundreds place doesn't occur because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, total 8's: units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488)\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times (since 488 < 800)\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since we can't have a fraction of a number, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check. Starting from 4, each subsequent 4 in the units place is 10 apart. So, the count should be floor(488/10) = 48.8, which we take as 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. How many ranges is that? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last 8 in the units place is 488. So, how many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 numbers. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 numbers. Wait, because from 8 to 488, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another, but since the book ends at 488, the range 480-488 has the tens digit 8 only up to 488. So, let me check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, all within 488. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 489 is beyond 488). So, total in tens place: 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4x10=40, plus the partial range 480-488 contributing 9. So total 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, then 180-189, another 10, 280-289, another 10, 380-389, another 10, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 full ranges (each 10) and one partial (9). So total 4x10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 800, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98 times. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 -98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences (since pages go up to 488).\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"
