Did I count correctly? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so that's correct. Hmm, I think the calculations are correct.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, the total 4's are correct. Similarly, for the tens place of 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 in that set.
