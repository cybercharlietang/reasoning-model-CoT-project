    "text": " Let me count the numbers in each set. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds. Total 8's: 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again, just to be sure. Let's try another approach for units and tens digits. For units digit: For any digit, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) if the digit is not zero, but since we're including zero, maybe it's different. Wait, no, from 1 to N, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((N + 1)/10). For example, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor((488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9\u219248. But wait, that's 48, but earlier I had 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, when I counted 4,14,...,484, that's 49 numbers. So, which is correct? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, which is 4 + 10*(k-1), where k starts at 1. The last term is 484, which is 4 +10*(k-1)=484 \u2192 10*(k-1)=480 \u2192 k-1=48 \u2192 k=49. So, 49 terms. So, the formula floor((N +1)/10) would give floor(488 +1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48. So, discrepancy here. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe it's better to think that the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus 1 if the digit is present in the incomplete decade. So, for 4 in units place up to 488: The number of complete decades is 48 (since 48*10=480). Each complete decade contributes one 4. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), there's a 4 in 484. So, total is 48 +1=49. So, yes, 49 fours in units place. Similarly, for 8's in units place: up to 488, the number of complete decades is 48, each contributing one 8. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, there's an 8 in 488. So, total is 48 +1=49 eights in units place. So, that's correct. For tens place: The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated by considering each hundred block. For example, for 4 in the tens place, in each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is the fifth hundred block. So, for each of the first four hundred blocks (0-399), each contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Now, in the fifth hundred block (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers. So, total fours in tens place:40 +10=50. Correct, as before. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: In each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, for the first four hundred blocks (0-399), that's 4*10=40. In the fifth hundred block (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total eights in tens place:40 +9=49. Correct. So, 4's:50 in tens place, 8's:49 in tens place. So, the total 4's:49(units)+50(tens)+89(hundreds)=188. 8's:49(units)+49(tens)+0(hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Wait, no, because in the hundreds place, we're already counting all the 400-488, which includes 440-449. So, that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think about each digit position separately without overlapping. Let me try another approach: For each page number from 1 to 488, count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit.\n\nWait, perhaps another way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For 4's: every 10 numbers, so total occurrences: floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so it's 48 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's clarify: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if d <= n mod 10 else 0). So, for 4's in units place up to 488:\n\nfloor(488/10) =48. Now, 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1, making it 49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in units place:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1, making it 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach block of 100 numbers contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, for numbers 1-488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nFor digit 4 in tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. So, 50 fours in tens place. Correct.\n\nFor digit 8 in tens place:\n\nSimilarly, each hundred contributes 10 times for 8 in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nDigit 4 in hundreds place: numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours.\n\nDigit 8 in hundreds place: numbers from 800-899, but since we only go up to 488, there are 0 eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes numbers where the hundreds digit is 4, but also, in those numbers, the tens and units digits could be 4 or 8 as well. But when counting the total number of 4's, each digit is counted separately, so overlapping digits are okay because each occurrence is counted. So, for example, 444 has three 4's, which are all counted in their respective digit positions. Similarly, 488 has an 8 in the tens and units place, but that's counted in the eights. So, I think the counting is correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position. For a number up to N, the count of digit d in position k can be calculated, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can think of each digit position separately and calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try another approach to verify. For the units digit: In each block of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, for the units digit: Number of 4's = 48 (from the full blocks) +1 (from 484) =49. Similarly, number of 8's in units place: 48 (from full blocks) +1 (from 488) =49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so in the units place, 8 appears once in each block of 10, so 48 times plus one more in 488, which is 49. So, units digit: 49 fours, 49 eights. For the tens digit: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 pages in 400-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. Now, the partial hundred from 400-488: Let's look at the tens digit in this range. The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit: 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so that's 10 fours. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the partial hundred, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. Therefore, total tens place fours:40 +10=50. Total tens place eights:40 +9=49. For the hundreds digit: From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no fours or eights. From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no fours or eights. Similarly, 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 300-399:3, so no fours or eights. From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). So, hundreds place fours:89, hundreds place eights:0. So, adding up:\n\nFours:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188.\n\nEights:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in this approach. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between them.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (1s):** The digit '4' appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it another way to cross-verify. Let's consider the total number of digits. From 1 to 488, how many digits are there? Well, pages 1-9:9 pages, each with 1 digit:9 digits. Pages 10-99:90 pages, each with 2 digits:180 digits. Pages 100-488:488-99=389 pages, each with 3 digits:1167 digits. Total digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits. Wait, but maybe that's not necessary here. Alternatively, maybe I can check how many 4's and 8's are in each position again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. Correct. For 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0. Correct. So, the total 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.

But for the 8's, when counting the tens place, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So, 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so 488-480+1=9. Correct. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, 480-489 would be 10, but since we stop at 488, it's 9. So, that's correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me count the number of 8's in the tens place. Each of the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, etc.) have 10 numbers, so 10*4=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98. So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. And 8's:49+49=98. So, difference is 90. So, the answer is 90. Wait, but let me think again: when counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, which is 10 numbers, but in reality, 40-49 is 10 numbers, but when considering the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as for each digit position, how many times 4 appears. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. Let me try another method to cross-verify. For the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n: It's floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >=d, else 0). Similarly, for the tens place, it's floor(n/100)*10 + something. Wait, perhaps that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can use the standard method for counting digit occurrences. Let's try that. To count the number of times a digit d appears in each position:\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of times d appears = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if n % 10 >= d else 0)\nBut wait, actually, for units digit, it's (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). But since d is 4 and 8, let's compute.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula where for each digit position, the count is calculated based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, since I already have the counts as 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's, and the difference is 90, maybe that's correct. Wait, but let me think again about the 4's in the tens place. From 40-49:10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 50.\n\nUnits place: 49, as 4,14,...,484:49 numbers.\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18,...,488:49 numbers.\n\nTens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 800>488.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I think sometimes when counting in the tens place, for example, 480-488, is that 9 numbers? Let me check: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that last set.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, etc. So, 4 sets of 10, and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.

So, that might be where the difference comes from. So, the hundreds place for 4's adds 89, while for 8's, there are none in the hundreds place. So, that's a significant difference. So, maybe the answer is 90. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when counting the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which includes 440-449. But 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again. When I count the tens place for 8's, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, right? Because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, that's correct. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, that's correct. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, yes, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm. Let me try that.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, starting at 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? The formula is floor((488 - 4)/10) +1. So, (484)/10=48.4, floor is 48, +1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: Every 100 numbers, 10 times. So, from 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:10? Wait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is in 1-100. Similarly, 140-149 in 101-200, etc. So, each 100 numbers has 10. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n- Units place: Every 10 numbers, starting at 8. So, from 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is floor((488-8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: As the book ends at 488, there are no hundreds digits of 8. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, I think that's correct.

So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting digit positions, especially in the tens and hundreds places, I might have missed something. Let me try a different approach. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position separately. For the units digit: For 4's, as before, 49 times. For 8's, 49 times. For the tens digit: For 4's, 50 times (as each hundred block has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, and there are 5 hundred blocks up to 488). For 8's, in the tens place, it's 49 times because the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers. Wait, so in the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49. So, that's 1 more 4 in the tens place. For the hundreds digit: 4's have 89, 8's have 0. So, 89 more 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.

    "text": " Let me recount: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 (since 488 is included). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 units and 49 tens, total 98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can think about each digit position separately for both 4 and 8 and see if the counts are accurate.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. That's 48, but wait, in each set, the 4 is at the units place. But wait, 488 is the last number, so does the 48th set end at 480? So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1-8, so no additional 4 in units place beyond the 48 sets. But wait, each set is 10 numbers, so 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from 1-480) plus one more at 484? Wait, no, 484 is within 481-490, but 488 is the last page. So, 484 is in the 48th set, which is 481-490, but since we only go to 488, the 4 in 484 is still counted. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49 because 488 is included, and 488 is 8 in units, so 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 units place 4's. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred. So, in each hundred, except possibly the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49:10\n- 100-199:140-149:10\n- 200-299:240-249:10\n- 300-399:340-349:10\n- 400-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488)\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 440-449 is 10 numbers, which is fine. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, 50 tens place 4's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, and the last set (480-488) has 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but our book ends at 488, so no 8's in hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me recount: 80-89 is 10, then 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. Correct. So, yes, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 90.

    "text": " Let me count each set: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for the 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as 400-488 being 89 numbers, yes. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 fours. 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and units places, I might have missed something. Let me try another approach to verify. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately again. For 4's: Units place: numbers ending with 4 from 1 to 488. The first is 4, last is 484. So, how many terms? The sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. So, 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 => 484-4=480=(n-1)*10 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. Correct. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. So, total 49+50+89=188. Correct. For 8's: Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8, last term is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 488=8 + (n-1)*10 => 480=(n-1)*10 => n-1=48 =>n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Correct. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 8. These are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, but the last set, 480-488, has only 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in tens place. Correct. Hundreds place: no numbers from 800-899, so 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, I think my initial calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '4' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The first four sets have 10 numbers each, and the last set has 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers of the book.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
