This is 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last block (480-488) has 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

So, 90 seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the total number of digits. Let me see: total number of digits from 1 to 488. But maybe that's not necessary here. Alternatively, I can check my counts again. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place: from 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's a lot. So, 188 fours total. For 8's, since the hundreds place doesn't contribute, it's only 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. This gives 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me check the units place for 8's: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.
