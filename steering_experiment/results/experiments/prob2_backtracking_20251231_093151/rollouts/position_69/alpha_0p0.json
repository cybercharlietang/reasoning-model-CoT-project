So, 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so yes, 9 eights in the tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, yeah, the difference is 90. Hmm, but wait, I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately, but maybe I missed some numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. Let me try that. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let's start with the units place. **Units place:**\n- For 4: The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n  - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n  - So, total number is floor(488/10) =48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n- For 8: Similarly, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n  - From 8,18,...,488. The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times.\n\n**Tens place:**\n- For 4: The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n  - Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges *10=50.\n- For 8: The tens digit is 8 in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n  - The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last range has 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n**Hundreds place:**\n- For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488.\n  - 488 -400 +1=89 numbers.\n- For 8: The hundreds digit is 8 would be in 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- **4's:** 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- **8's:**49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so I think my initial calculation was correct.

For example, in the tens place for 4's, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included in the hundreds place count as well. But since we're counting digit positions separately, that's fine. Similarly, in the units place, 484 is counted once in units, once in tens (if applicable), and once in hundreds (if applicable). But in this case, 484 is in the hundreds place as 4, and in the tens place as 8, but wait, 484 is 4 in hundreds, 8 in tens, and 4 in units. Wait, so in 484, the digit 4 appears twice, and 8 appears once. So, when I counted the units place, I included 484 as a 4 in units. In the tens place, I included 484 as an 8 in tens. And in the hundreds place, I included it as a 4. So, that's correct. So, 484 contributes to both 4's and 8's counts. Similarly, 488 would have 8's in units and tens, but since 488 is the last page, it's included in the units place count for 8's and the tens place count for 8's. So, I think my counts are correct.

Maybe I should consider if 0 is included, but since page numbers start at 1, 0 isn't a page number, so I think that's fine. Also, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488 is correct because 488 is the last page. For 8's, the hundreds place isn't used, so that's correct. I think my calculations are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{484}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.  \n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     5 \\times 10 = 50\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     488 - 400 + 1 = 89\n     \\]\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 50 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 89 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 188\n\\]\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Number of occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49\n     \\]\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.  \n   - The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last range contributes 9 numbers.  \n   - Total occurrences:  \n     \\[\n     4 \\times 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49\n     \\]\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.  \n   - Number of occurrences: 0\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n\\[\n49 \\, (\\text{units}) + 49 \\, (\\text{tens}) + 0 \\, (\\text{hundreds}) = 98\n\\]\n\n**Difference between the number of 4's and 8's:**  \n\\[\n188 - 98 = 90\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n\\boxed{90}"
