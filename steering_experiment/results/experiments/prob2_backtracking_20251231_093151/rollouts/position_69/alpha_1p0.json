So, 49+49=98 eights. 4's are 188. 188-98=90. So, yes, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think if I considered all cases correctly. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, 400-488: 89 numbers. That's correct because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. For the tens place of 4's, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. For 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is correct. So, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, you might miss a number or count an extra. Let me try a different approach to verify. Another way to count digits is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears. For example, in the units place, for numbers 1-488, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except maybe the last few digits. Let's see: For units place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in each position except maybe the last one. Wait, but from 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete groups, and 8 extra numbers. So, for units digit, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 get one more each. So, for digit 4, in units place: 48 +1=49. Similarly, for digit 8: 48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought units place for 8's was 49, which matches. But in the tens place, it's similar. Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the tens place, except maybe the last partial group. Wait, but from 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 hundreds (1-400, 401-800, but wait, the book is only up to 488, so let's see: 1-99: tens digits 0-9 each appear 10 times. 100-199: same. 200-299: same. 300-399: same. 400-488: tens digits 0-8 each appear 9 times (since 488 is the last number). Wait, no, let me think again. From 1-99: tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) and 1-9 for 10-99. So, each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times except 0, which appears 9 times? Wait, no, from 1-99, the tens digit for numbers 1-9 is 0, so 0 appears 9 times, and digits 1-9 appear 10 times each. Then, from 100-199: tens digits cycle 0-9 ten times each, so each digit appears 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: same. 300-399: same. 400-488: tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 9 times (since 488 is the 8th tens digit). Wait, let me calculate it properly. From 400-488: the tens digits are 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 9 times except for 8, which appears 9 times as well (from 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488 inclusive). Wait, 488-480=8, but inclusive, so 9 numbers. So, for 400-488, each tens digit 0-8 appears 9 times. So, total for tens place: from 1-99: 10 times each for digits 1-9, and 9 times for 0. From 100-399: 3 sets of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per set, so 30 times each. From 400-488: each digit 0-8 appears 9 times. So, total for tens place:\n\n- Digit 0: 9 (from 1-99) + 3*10 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =9+30+9=48\n- Digits 1-8: 10 (from 1-99) +3*10 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =10+30+9=49\n- Digit 9: 10 (from 1-99) +3*10 (from 100-399) +0 (from 400-488) =10+30=40\n\nWait, but this is for the tens place. So, digit 4 in the tens place appears 49 times. Which matches my earlier count. Similarly, digit 8 in the tens place appears 49 times. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Wait, but earlier when I counted the 8's in the tens place, I had 49, which matches. But earlier, when I thought about 4's in the tens place, I had 50, which contradicts this. Wait, no, in the initial approach, I had 50 fours in the tens place, but according to this breakdown, it's 49. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in my initial approach, I considered 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, totaling 50. But according to this breakdown, it's 49. So, there's a discrepancy here. Let me figure out which one is correct.\n\nWait, from 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199:140-149:10\n\nFrom 200-299:240-249:10\n\nFrom 300-399:340-349:10\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. But according to the other method, it's 49. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, in the other method, when I broke down the tens place, I had:\n\nFrom 1-99:10 fours in the tens place (40-49)\n\nFrom 100-399:3 sets of 100, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place (140-149, 240-249, 340-349), so 3*10=30\n\nFrom 400-488:440-449:10 fours\n\nSo total:10+30+10=50. So that's 50 fours in the tens place. But in the other approach, I thought that from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 9 times, but that's not correct because 440-449 is a full set of 10 numbers, so it's 10 times. Therefore, the initial count of 50 fours in the tens place is correct, and the other approach was wrong because I miscounted the 440-449 range as 9 instead of 10. So, the correct count is 50 fours in the tens place, leading to total 4's being 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188, which matches the initial count.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the tens place, let's check:\n\nFrom 1-99:80-89:10 eights\n\nFrom 100-199:180-189:10\n\nFrom 200-299:280-289:10\n\nFrom 300-399:380-389:10\n\nFrom 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the digit position analysis, I thought the tens digit for 8's was 49, which is correct, and units digit was 49, so total 98. So, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, the 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. But in the hundreds place, 8's don't appear because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Units place: 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is included. Let's see: The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, how many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about page numbers, sometimes the hundreds digit might not be considered, but in this case, the hundreds digit for 4's does contribute a lot. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units and tens, it's similar, but hundreds is different. For units digit: Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last few numbers. For 488 pages, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, total number of units digits is 488 /10 =48 full cycles, with 8 extra numbers (480-488). Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the extra 8 numbers (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8, so digits 0-8 appear once more. So, digit 4 appears 48 +1=49 times in units place. Similarly, digit 8 appears 48 +1=49 times. Wait, but in the units place, 8 appears in 488, so yes, 49 times. Similarly, for the tens place: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have their tens digits. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 480-489 would be tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488). So, in 401-480, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 7 (471-480). Then, 481-488 has tens digit 8. So, for the tens place in 401-488: digits 0-8 each appear 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times (from 481-488). Wait, no. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, from 401-488, the tens digits are as follows: 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n...\n471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488:\n- digits 0-7: 10 each\n- digit 8: 8 times\n\nSo, total in the tens place for 401-488 is 8 digits (0-7) with 10 each, and 8 with 8. So, the number of 8's in the tens place from 401-488 is 8. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) +8=48. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. From 1-100: 10 eights in tens place (80-89)\n101-200: another 10 (180-189)\n201-300: another 10 (280-289)\n301-400: another 10 (380-389)\n401-488: as above, 8 eights in tens place (480-488)\nSo, total eights in tens place:10+10+10+10+8=48. So, that's 48, not 49 as I thought earlier. Wait, so earlier I thought it was 49, but now it's 48. Which is correct? Let me recount. From 80-89:10\n180-189:10\n280-289:10\n380-389:10\n480-488:9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488)\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, that's 9, not 8. So, total eights in tens place:10+10+10+10+9=49. So, the correct count is 49. Earlier, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in tens place:49. So, the earlier count was correct. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98. So, that's correct. Now, the fours: units (49), tens (50), hundreds (89). Wait, let me check the tens place for fours again. From 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 occurrences:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349. So, 4 sets of 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total fours in tens place:40+10=50. Correct. Hundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. So, 188 fours and 98 eights. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).  \n   - Total occurrences: 50 (10 in each of the five blocks).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total number of 4's:**  \n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).  \n   - Total occurrences: 49 (10 in each of the four full blocks and 9 in the partial block 480-488).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**  \n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Tens place for 4's: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's:400-488:89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, for 8's: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10,180-189:10,280-289:10,380-389:10,480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Similarly, for 8's in units place, up to 488, the last one is 488, which is included. So, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers. So, units place for 4's:49, for 8's:49.

Did I count correctly for the tens place in 8's? Let me check 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 5 sets: 10,10,10,10,9. That adds up to 49.

    "text": " Units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 90 seems like a big number. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's? Let me check: from 400 to 488, inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. And the tens place for 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So that's 10. So, 5 sets, 10 each, 50. Correct. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it differently. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm. Let me try another approach for 4's. For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 appears. 1. Units place: For each complete group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, in the 49th group (481-490), but our book ends at 488, so only up to 488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The first term is 4, last term is 484. The difference between terms is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times. Correct. 2. Tens place: For each complete group of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, how many complete groups of 100 are there in 488? 488 /100=4.88, so 4 complete groups. Each contributes 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete group (from 400-488), how many fours in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 fours. So, total tens place fours:40+10=50. Correct. 3. Hundreds place: From 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Correct. Now, for 8's: 1. Units place: Similar to 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8,18,...,488. How many terms? (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. 2. Tens place: For each complete group of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete group (401-488), we have 480-488, which is 480-488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488-480+1=9. So, 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights:40+9=49. Correct. 3. Hundreds place: As before, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each complete set (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights, totaling 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 480-488, there are 9 eights.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear here since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
