But just to be thorough, maybe I can check with a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a book with 28 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-28. Counting 4's: units place: 4,14,24: 3 times. Tens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 28, no 4's in tens place. Hundreds place: none. So, total 4's:3. 8's: units place:8,18,28:3 times. Tens place:80-89, but only up to 28, so none. So, total 8's:3. So, 3-3=0. So, no difference. Now, let's see if my method would give that. Units place for 4: from 4 to 24, which is 24/10=2.4, so 3 numbers (4,14,24). Correct. For 8's: units place:8,18,28:3. Correct. So, the method works here. Another test: book with 50 pages. How many 4's and 8's? 4's: units:4,14,24,34,44:5. Tens:40-49:10. Hundreds: none. Total 4's:15. 8's: units:8,18,28,38,48:5. Tens:40-49: none, since 8 in tens would be 80-89, which is beyond 50. So, 5 eights. So, 15-5=10 more 4's. Let's see if my method gives that. Units 4's:44 is the last, so (44-4)/10 +1=4+1=5. Correct. Tens 4's:40-49:10, but since 50 is the limit, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10. Total 15. For 8's: units:8,18,28,38,48:5. Tens: none, since 80-89 >50. So, 5. 15-5=10. Correct. So, my method seems to work.

    "text": " units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. So, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or something. For counting digits, a common approach is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears. For a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits. But in this case, since the number isn't too large, maybe breaking it down as I did is sufficient. Alternatively, for the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is given by (n / 10) + (1 if the remainder is >=d else 0). But maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, for each position, the count can be calculated as follows: For the units digit: number of complete groups of 10 is 488 // 10 =48, and the remainder is 8. So, for 4's in units place: each group contributes 1, so 48, plus if the remainder is >=4, which it is (8>=4), so add 1, total 49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation, 48 groups, each contributing 1, and remainder 8 >=8, so add 1, total 49. For the tens place: each group of 100 contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for 4's in tens place: 488 // 100 =4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining part is 88. In the tens place, we look at how many complete tens are there in 88. 88//10=8, and the digit we're looking for is 4. Since 8 >=4, we add 10 more fours (from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in the hundreds place, but wait, actually, in the tens place, for the remaining 88, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for 4's in the tens place in the remaining 88, we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49 in the 400s). So, total for tens place: 4*10 +10=50. Similarly, for 8's in tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 eights (80-89 in each hundred). So, 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the remaining 88, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total eights in tens place:40 +9=49. For the hundreds place: for 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. For 8's, the hundreds digit would be 8 from 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0 eights in the hundreds place. So, same as before, 188 fours and 98 eights, difference is 90. Yeah, so that seems consistent.
