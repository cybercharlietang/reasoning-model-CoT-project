    "text": " Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try another approach. Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit, but maybe using a formula or a more systematic approach. For the units digit: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Wait, but in our case, we're considering 4 and 8. Wait, no, actually, for any digit, the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is equal to (n + 1) // 10 * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, for the units digit, the number of times 4 appears is (488 + 1) // 10 = 48.9, which is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then if the last partial cycle has a 4, which it does because 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in units place is 484, so 48 +1=49. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's (488 +1) //10=48, and since 488 ends with 8, we add 1, so 49. So, units digits: 49 fours, 49 eights. For the tens digit, the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n can be calculated by looking at each hundred block. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488, which is 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 488 is in the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488. So, for the tens digit:\n\n- For each hundred (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nBut in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the max). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, for digit 4 in the tens place: in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and in 400-488, it's another 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 5 *10=50. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: in each of the first four hundreds, 10 times, and in 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times. So, total for 8 in tens place: 4*10 +9=49. So, that matches my earlier count: 50 fours in tens place, 49 eights in tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated earlier.\n- Digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 89 fours in hundreds place, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n- Fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n- Eights:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think my initial calculation was correct.

    "text": " Wait, but another way to approach this is to think about how many digits are there in total and then calculate the frequency. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula for each digit position. Let me try that for 4's and 8's.\n\nFor the units place of 4's: The number of times 4 appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor((N +1)/10). For N=488, floor(489/10)=48, but since 488 has a 4 in the units place, it's actually 49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: floor((488 +1)/10)=48.9, which is 48, but since 488 is included, it's 49. So, that matches.\n\nFor the tens place, the formula is a bit more complex. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to N can be calculated by considering higher digits and the lower digits. For example, for 4 in the tens place up to 488: The higher digits are 0 to 4, but wait, let's see. The tens digit is 4 in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 numbers. So, the number of complete blocks is 4 (since 400-488 is the last block, but the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449). Wait, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. But in the last block, 440-449, that's within 488, so it's 10 numbers. So, 5*10=50. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place: blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, the number of times 4 appears is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, as calculated earlier. And 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.

For counting digits, sometimes it's helpful to break down each digit position separately, as I did, but maybe I missed something. Let me try to recount the 4's and 8's again. Counting 4's: Units place: numbers ending with 4. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. So, the sequence is 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: numbers where the tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d710=50. Correct. Hundreds place: numbers from 400-488. 488-400+1=89. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, 8's: Units place: numbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480, so (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: numbers where tens digit is 8. These are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, 49+49=98. Thus, 188-98=90.

Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Wait, but let me try another approach to cross-verify. Let's calculate the total number of digits used in the page numbers and see how many 4's and 8's are there. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position. For units and tens places, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except for the last partial set. For example, in the units place, for each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit appears once. So, up to page 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 complete sets, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for units place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count. So, for units place: digits 0:48, 1:49, 2:49, ..., 8:49, 9:48. Similarly, for tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). For each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens place in 401-488: - 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each for 10 numbers except the last one, which is only 8 numbers (481-488). So, for each digit 0-7, they appear 10 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, for 401-488, digits 0-7:10 each, 8:8. So, total for the tens place in the entire book: 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 for digits 0-7 and 8 for digit 8. So, for digits 0-7: 4*10 +10=50 each. For digit 8:4*10 +8=48. Wait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up something. Wait, no, because in the earlier approach, I considered 80-89, 180-189, etc., which are in different hundreds. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the earlier approach, I considered all sets where the tens digit is 8, which includes 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. But in this approach, when I broke down the tens digits per hundred, I saw that in each complete hundred (like 1-100), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 40+9=49. So, that matches the earlier count. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 49 times. Similarly, in the units place, as per the earlier approach, 8 appears 49 times. So, total 8's:49+49=98. That's consistent. Now, for the 4's: in units place, 49 times; tens place, 50 times; hundreds place,89 times. Total 188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. I can't spot any errors in the reasoning, so I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me see if I can think of another way to approach this problem. Maybe by calculating the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and then summing them up. For 4's: Units: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 has a 4 in the units place, we add 1, making it 49. Tens: floor(488/100)*10=4*10=40, plus the remainder: 88/10=8, so 40+8=48, but wait, no, that's not the right approach. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in each position. For units digit: For each complete set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). In those, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49. Similarly, for tens place: For each complete set of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In the tens place, how many 4's? From 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50. For hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total 4's:49+50+89=188. For 8's: Units place: Similarly, each set of 10 has one 8. 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. Total units place 8's:48+1=49. Tens place: Each set of 100 has one set of 10 where the tens digit is 8 (80-89). So, 488/100=4.88, so 4 complete sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). In the tens place, 480-488 has 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (480-488). So, 9. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49. Hundreds place: As before, 0. So, total 8's:49+49=98. Therefore, the difference is 188-98=90. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 90. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 8's, I initially thought of 480-488 as 9 numbers, but let me check: 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 488-480=8, so plus 1 is 9. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place from 480-488. So, 40 (from the first four sets) plus 9=49. Correct. So, yes, 98 eights in total.

    "text": " Let me think of another way to approach it. Maybe by considering each digit position separately for both 4's and 8's. For 4's: units, tens, hundreds. For 8's: units, tens, hundreds. Let me try to visualize the page numbers as three-digit numbers, padding with leading zeros for numbers less than 100. So, page 1 is 001, page 10 is 010, page 100 is 100, etc. Then, for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's. So, for units digit: from 000 to 488, but since pages start at 1, maybe 001 to 488. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe using a formula. For each digit position, the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows. Let's denote the position as the units, tens, or hundreds place. For each position, we can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear. Let's start with the units place for 4's. In the units place, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. But since the last group is 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the last group is incomplete. But wait, in the units place, the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place, not a 4. So, the last complete group would be 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the units digit 4 in 484 is included. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is floor((488 +1)/10) = floor(489/10)=48. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the number of units digits is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, 48*10=480, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is within 480-489. So, 484 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because from 1-10: one 4, 11-20: one 4, ..., 481-490: one 4 at 484. So, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and the 49th ten would be 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so in that incomplete ten, we have 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, total units place 4's:49. Similarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation. From 1 to 488, number of 8's in units place is floor((488)/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, it's 49. Wait, let me think again. The first 8 is at 8, then 18, 28,...,488. So, how many terms? The sequence is 8,18,28,...,488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 +10(n-1) =488. Solving for n: 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. So, that's correct. Now, for the tens place. For 4's in the tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 sets of hundreds. In each, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, except possibly the last set if it's incomplete. Wait, the last set is 400-488. The tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, but wait, no: the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, 4 in 440-449. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 tens digit 4's, except maybe the last one. Wait, 400-488 includes 400-499, but we stop at 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, total tens digit 4's: 5 sets *10=50. Correct. Now, for 8's in the tens place: similar approach. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such sets? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, 5 sets. In each, 10 numbers. But in the last set, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, in the last set, instead of 10, we have 9. So, total tens digit 8's: 4 sets *10 +1 set *9=40+9=49. Correct. Now, hundreds place: 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 hundreds digit 4's. For 8's in the hundreds place: since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0. So, total 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=188. Total 8's: units(49)+tens(49)+hundreds(0)=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, I think that's correct. Maybe I should try a smaller example to verify. Let's say a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n- Units:4,14 \u2192 2\n- Tens:40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 4's:2\n\nCounting 8's:\n- Units:8,18 \u21922\n- Tens:80-89, but we only go up to 20, so 0\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:2\n\nDifference:2-2=0. That makes sense because in 1-20, 4's and 8's appear equally in units place, and no tens or hundreds.\n\nAnother example: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n- Units:4,14,24,34,44 \u21925\n- Tens:40-49 \u219210\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:15\n\n8's:\n- Units:8,18,28,38,48 \u21925\n- Tens:40-49 is 4's tens, but 8's tens would be 80-89, which is beyond 50, so 0\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:5\n\nDifference:15-5=10. Let's see if that's correct. Pages 1-50.\n\n4's: units (5) + tens (10) =15.\n\n8's: units (5) + tens (0)=5.\n\nYes, difference is 10. So, the method works. Therefore, applying it to 488 pages, the difference is 90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, so total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\nTotal number of 4's: \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences except the last range, which contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place for any page number up to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 0 \\).\n\nTotal number of 8's: \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n### Calculating the difference:\n- Number of 4's: 188\n- Number of 8's: 98\n- Difference: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\)\n\nThus, the number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(\\boxed{90}\\)."

    "text": " Wait, but let me think again: 188 fours and 98 eights. 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Alternatively, maybe I should consider each digit position separately for both 4 and 8, and ensure I didn't double-count or miss any. Let me try a different approach: for each page number from 1 to 488, count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit. But that might be too time-consuming, but perhaps I can verify a part of it. For example, in the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 fours there. 8's in the hundreds place: none, since 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 eights there. In the tens place, 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. 8's in the tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 5 sets, the last one being 9 numbers, totaling 49 eights. In the units place, 4's: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, each contributing one 4. 8's in the units place: 8,18,...,488. That's 49 numbers, each contributing one 8. So, adding up: 4's:89 (hundreds) +50 (tens) +49 (units) =188. 8's:0 (hundreds) +49 (tens) +49 (units)=98. So, 188-98=90.

Count is ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 fours, 49 eights. Tens place: For 4's: numbers where tens digit is 4. These are 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks: 5*10=50. For 8's: numbers where tens digit is 8: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, but the last block (480-488) has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Hundreds place: For 4's: numbers from 400-488. That's 488-400+1=89. For 8's: no numbers, since 800>488. So, hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Total eights:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90. Yes, that's consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).

The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I'm overcomplicating, but I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me try another approach: instead of counting each digit place separately, maybe I can count the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense. But that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different counting method. For example, for each position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear. Let me try that again for each digit position.\n\nFor the units place:\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/10) =48, but since 488 ends with 8, the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is 484/10=48.4, so 49 times.\n- Similarly, for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 is included, it's 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems consistent with what I had before.\n\nFor the tens place:\n- For 4's: Each hundred has a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4, so 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, each hundred has a block of 10 where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc. But in the last hundred (400-488), the block would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10, and one partial block with 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- For 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4.\n- For 8's: There are no hundreds digits of 8 since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.

But since 488 is included, and 488 has 8 in units, but 484 is the last 4 in units. So, from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in units is 48 +1 (since 484 is included), so 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the units digit is >=8. Since 488 ends with 8, so 48 +1=49.

So, for 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete block 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. So, that's 10 numbers. So total tens digit 4's:40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place:\n\n- Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the incomplete block 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens digit 8's:40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place for digit 4:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 fours. Correct.\n\nFor digit 8 in hundreds place:\n\n- Since 800-899 is beyond 488, there are 0 eights in hundreds place.

Then, from 481 to 488, the next number with a 4 in the units place is 484, which is within this range. So, that's one more. So, total 49. Correct.\n\n- For 8: Similarly, from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the number of complete decades. Each decade has one 8 in the units place (8,18,...,488).

Wait, that contradicts my earlier count of 49. Wait, no, because 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, so from 8 to 488, how many terms? It's (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 terms. So, 49 eights in the units place. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n- For 4: The tens digit is 4 in numbers from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.

Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- For 8: The tens digit is 8 in numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last set, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total 40+9=49.
