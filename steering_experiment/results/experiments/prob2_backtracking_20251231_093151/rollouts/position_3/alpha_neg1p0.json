    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the units place because that's where the 4's and 8's can appear. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nStarting with the units place. The page numbers go from 1 to 488. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in cycles of 10. So, for every 10 pages, each digit appears once in the units place. Let's see how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (480 to 488). In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, we have 8 extra pages beyond 480. Let me check those: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. In these, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal. \n\nNow moving to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89). So, for each hundred, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, let's check the partial hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in the range 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but each of these has the tens digit as 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. But actually, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so it's 9 times. Wait, no, 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8, and from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The total number of 8's is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. Each of these digits appears 100 times in the hundreds place for each hundred. For example, 1 appears 100 times from 1-100, 2 appears 100 times from 101-200, and so on. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nThe hundreds digit 8 never appears because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Complete groups: 48, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n- Extra pages: 484 and 488, so 1 each.\nTotal units: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each.\n- Partial hundred: 440-449 (10 4's) and 480-488 (9 8's).\nTotal tens: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n8's: 49 +49 +0 =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the units place, the extra pages are 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 481,482,...,488. So, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 0 times for 8's.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1 =89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: each digit place is handled separately, so units, tens, hundreds. For each, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages have 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages have 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits are involved. Page numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, from 10 to 99 are two-digit, and from 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. So, I can split the problem into three parts: single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers. \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digits are just 1 through 9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only page 4, so that's one 4. How about 8's? Only page 8, so one 8. So, in single-digit pages, 4 appears once and 8 appears once, so the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count the number of 4's and 8's in both places.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), the number of 4's in the units place is 9. \n\nWait, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, yes, 9 times 4 appears in the units place. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's also 9 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 1 through 9. When the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. The total number of 8's is 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. So, again, the difference here is zero.\n\nMoving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. I'll need to analyze each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. Let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. The numbers from 400 to 488 are 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0 through 9, and the same goes for the units digit. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places.\n\nStarting with the tens place. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), except for the last hundred, 400-488, where we might have fewer numbers if the upper limit isn't a full hundred.\n\nWait, let me think. From 100-399, each hundred is complete, so each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times 4 appears in the tens place. For 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, that's another 10. So total 40 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place. In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears for 10 numbers each (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times. For 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, 9 times. So total 39 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, but the units digit goes up to 8 as well. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, 9 times. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once in the units place for each ten numbers. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. For 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-8, so 4 appears once in each ten, so 9 times (404, 414, ..., 484). Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think: from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, 4 appears once. There are 9 tens (0-8), so 9 times. So total for units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place. In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 8 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198). So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. For 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, ..., 488. Let's see how many that is. Starting from 408, each ten adds 10, so 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't double count. For three-digit numbers, the units place for 4 is 30 (from 100-399) plus 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Similarly for 8, it's 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier in the tens place, I had 40 times for 4 and 39 times for 8. So, let me sum up:\n\nFor three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal for 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me go through each part again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n- 4: 1 (page 4)\n- 8: 1 (page 8)\nCorrect.\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Units place for 4: 9 (14,24,...,94)\n- Tens place for 4: 10 (40-49)\nTotal: 19\nSimilarly for 8:\n- Units place: 9 (18,28,...,98)\n- Tens place: 10 (80-89)\nTotal: 19\nSo, correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 never appears here.\n- Tens place: For 4, each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399) has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149), so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488 has 440-449, which is 10, so total 40. For 8, each hundred has 10 numbers (180-189, etc.), so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488 has 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 39.\n- Units place: For 4, each hundred has 10 numbers (e.g., 104,114,...,194), so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488 has 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers, so total 39. For 8, each hundred has 10 numbers (108,118,...,198), so 3\u00d710=30. Then, 400-488 has 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers, so total 39.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nTotal across all pages:\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears 9 times, '8' appears 9 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 10 times (40-49), '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: '4' = 19, '8' = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears 89 times (400-488), '8' appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 40 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** '4' appears 39 times, '8' appears 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: '4' = 168, '8' = 78.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - '4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - '8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated independently. Let me start with the units place because that seems the simplest.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra in the last partial block. The last 8 numbers are 481 to 488. Let's see, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So adding that, the total 4's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there?\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and 88 extra numbers. In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and the same for 8 (like 80-89). So for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. So 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the extra 88 numbers are from 401 to 488. Let me check the tens digits here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So from 400-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place in these 88 numbers? Well, the tens digit is 4 only in the range 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive) because 488 is the last page. So 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total 4's are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The total 8's are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. In a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 1 appears from 100-199: that's 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- Digit 2 appears from 200-299: 100 times.\n- Digit 3 appears from 300-399: 100 times.\n- Digit 4 appears from 400-488: that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, how many 4's and 8's are in the hundreds place? \n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nAdding these together: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 48 full tens, so 48 each, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. So 4 hundreds would give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times) and 8 for 480-488 (9 times). So 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. So difference is 1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. So difference is 89. That seems correct.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the hundreds place, I counted 89 times because 400-488 is 89 numbers. But does page 400 count as the first page with 4 in the hundreds place? Yes, so 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So 10 vs 9, difference of 1. Correct.\n\nUnits place, as we saw, is equal. So the total difference is 89 + 1 = 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 (484) and 1 more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's. Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 / 100 = 4 full cycles, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's. Difference: 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488 (89 pages), contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Total: 89 4's and 0 8's. Difference: 89.\n\nSumming the differences: 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers range from 1 to 488. I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference between the two totals.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 groups, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So adding that, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Wait, that means in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 pages) plus 8 more pages. So in each 10, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 48 times each, and then in the last 8 pages, only 484 and 488 have 4 and 8 in the units place, so that's one more each. So yes, units place gives 49 fours and 49 eights. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. For example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but we can ignore that since we're only considering the digits printed. Starting from 10, the tens digit becomes 1, then 2, up to 48 in the case of 488. Wait, no, 488 is 4 digits, but page numbers go up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8 in the case of 480-488.\n\nWait, let me correct that. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go 0 (10 times: 1-9), 1 (10 times: 10-19), up to 9 (10 times: 90-99). But since our book goes up to 488, which is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place. Let me think: the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So for numbers 1-9, the tens digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 10-99, the tens digits go from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So in the first 99 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nThen, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So in 100-199, 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). Similarly, in 200-299, the same pattern, so another 10 fours and 10 eights. \n\nThen, 300-399: same thing, 10 fours and 10 eights. Now, 400-488: here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). So in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Let me see: from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers, so 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480 is 480, 481, ..., up to 488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these, so 9 times. So in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo let's sum up the tens digits:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 fours, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 100-199: 10 fours, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 200-299: 10 fours, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 fours, 10 eights.\n\nFrom 400-488: 10 fours, 9 eights.\n\nSo total fours in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo in the tens place, fours appear 50 times and eights appear 49 times, so the difference here is 1 more four.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so we can ignore that. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no fours or eights here. From 200-299, it's 2, same thing. From 300-399, it's 3. Now, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. \n\nAs for the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page numbered 800 or above, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So the difference here is 89 more fours than eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each digit place.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for eights:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo the total number of fours is 188, and the total number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full decades (each contributing 1 four and 1 eight) plus the last 8 pages (481-488), which contribute one four (484) and one eight (488). So 48*1 +1=49 fours, same for eights. Correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-99, 10 fours and 10 eights. Then from 100-399, each hundred contributes another 10 fours and 10 eights, so 3 more hundreds, so 3*10=30 fours and 30 eights. Then from 400-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total fours in tens place: 10 (1-99) + 30 (100-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50. Eights: 10 + 30 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-99, 100-199) has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - From 1-99: 10 fours, 10 eights.\n   - From 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, totaling 30 fours and 30 eights.\n   - From 400-488: The tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this range.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has pages from 1 to 488, so that's 488 pages in total. Now, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to look at each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll do this for both digits 4 and 8 and then sum up their occurrences.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's first count how many times 4 appears in the units place. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at page 4). From 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, 4 appears once in the units place. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to find how many complete sets of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole sets, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, I should check if the 49th set (from 481 to 490) is partially included. Since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 would appear at 484, which is within the 481-490 range. So, that's one more occurrence, making it 49 times in the units place for 4.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 occurrences. Similarly, from 101 to 200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues every hundred. \n\nLet me calculate how many hundreds are in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the next set, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 occurrences. So, adding that, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so after 400, we have 401-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total for tens place is 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 4 in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in each set of 10 pages, 8 appears once (like page 8, 18, etc.). So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, totaling 48. But wait, in the 49th set (481-490), page 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place at 488. So, total units place occurrences for 8 are 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. \n\nLet's count how many complete hundreds are in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each of these, the tens digit 8 appears once per hundred, so that's 4 times, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 4 x 10 = 40. \n\nNow, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is the first, then 481 up to 488, that's 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, so that's 9 occurrences. So, adding that, the tens place for 8 is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place for 8 is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, that's 9 more. So, total tens place for 8 is 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8 in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the 8 at 488, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 8 would be 0, which is correct because the book ends at 488, so no page numbers in the 800s.\n\nNow, let me confirm the counts for 4 and 8 again.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I made any mistakes in counting.\n\nFor the units place of 4:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges. Wait, wait, no, earlier I thought it was 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, and then one more in 401-488. Let me recount.\n\nFrom 1-100: 40-49: 10\n101-200: 140-149:10\n201-300:240-249:10\n301-400:340-349:10\n401-488:440-449:10 (since 440-449 is within 401-488)\nWait, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, that's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place of 4:\n\nFrom 400-488: how many numbers? 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct.\n\nFor 8:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many terms. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) is 10 numbers, but the last one, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So, 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, none. So, 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I included all the numbers correctly. For example, in the tens place for 8, in 480-488, is that 9 numbers? 480,481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence.\n\nI think I did it right. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to separate the problem into units, tens, hundreds, etc., places. So maybe I should calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then compare the totals.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the units place. For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So how many such blocks are there up to page 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, plus one more time in the 481-490 range, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so in the 481-488 range, 484 is the only page with a 4 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. Each block of 10 pages has one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete tens. That gives 48 fours in the units place. But then from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages, and 484 is one of them, so that's an additional 1. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. So how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, the next would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So 5 blocks x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 40-49: 10 pages, 4 in tens place. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on. So up to 440-449, that's five blocks. So 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is indeed 89 pages. So hundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nNow, let's add up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total fours printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to fours, each block of 10 pages has one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks. So 48 eights in the units place. Then, from 481-488, we have 488, which is an additional 8 in the units place. So total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that block. Each full block (like 80-89) has 10 eights in the tens place. So how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFirst block: 80-89: 10 pages. Second: 180-189: 10. Third: 280-289: 10. Fourth: 380-389: 10. Fifth: 480-488: which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last). So for the tens place, each full block gives 10 eights, and the last partial block gives 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So yes, that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nSo total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And 480-488: 9. So 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So 188 fours minus 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total: 49.\n\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5x10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 pages, each with a 4 in hundreds place. So 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1. Total: 49.\n\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. First four blocks are full, each contributing 10 eights, so 4x10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 pages, so 9 eights. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds: none, as pages go up to 488. So 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 eights. Correct.\n\nSo yes, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me check the tens place for fours again. From 40-49: 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: 10. 340-349: 10. 440-449: 10. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So 5x10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is partial. So 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial (9). So 4x10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: for fours, 48 full tens, plus one more in 484. So 49. For eights, 48 full tens, plus one in 488. So 49. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the total fours are 188, eights are 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages up to 480, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - Pages 481-488 include an additional '4' in 484, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages has a sequence where the tens digit is '4' for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such blocks up to 488: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 '4's, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - This range includes 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, each block of 10 pages contributes one '8'.\n   - 48 complete blocks contribute 48 '8's.\n   - Page 488 adds an additional '8' in the units place.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages has a sequence where the tens digit is '8' for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete blocks up to 480: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, contributing 40 '8's.\n   - Pages 480-488 contribute 9 more '8's in the tens place.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in a 488-page book have '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by figuring out how many digits each page number has. Page 1 to page 9 are single-digit, pages 10 to 99 are two-digit, and pages 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. So, I can split the problem into these three parts: single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that can appear are 1 through 9. So, how many times does the digit 4 appear here? Well, only once, on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once on page 8. So, for single-digit pages, the count of 4's is 1 and 8's is also 1. That means, in this part, there are zero more 4's than 8's.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place. For the tens digit, the numbers go from 10-19, 20-29, ..., up to 90-99. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, also 10 times. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each set of ten pages. So, for each ten pages (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94). There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears once in each set (18, 28, ..., 98), so 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, for each digit in the units place, it should appear 9 times. So, yes, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nAdding up the counts for two-digit numbers: in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and in the units place, 4 appears 9 times, so total 19 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place, totaling 19 times. So, again, in two-digit pages, the number of 4's and 8's is the same, each appearing 19 times.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I need to consider each place separately for digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, let's see how 4 appears in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. Now, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the highest page number is 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nBut wait, for the last hundred, which is 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but not up to 9. So, for the tens place in 400-488, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is included). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, for the tens place in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total for the tens place across all three-digit numbers. The first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's. Then, in the last hundred (400-488), as we saw, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding that, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40, and 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 3*10=30 for 4's, 3*10=30 for 8's. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 4's: 10, 8's:9. So, total for tens place: 4's=30+10=40, 8's=30+9=39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each set of ten. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nBut again, for the last hundred (400-488), we have to check if the units digit goes up to 9 or stops at 8. Since 488 is the last page, in the 400-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 9 for each tens digit up to 8, and for tens digit 8, units go up to 8. Wait, no, actually, for each tens digit, the units go from 0-9, except when the page number exceeds 488. So, in 400-488, the units digits go from 0-9 for tens digits 0-8, and for tens digit 8, units go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how does that affect the count?\n\nLet me think. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit goes from 0 to 9, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place. For the tens digit 8, units go from 0 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place (48 and 88). Wait, but 48 would be in the units place as 48, but wait, no, the units digit is the last digit, so 48 would be in the tens place as 4 and 8 in units. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9, except when the page number would exceed 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit goes from 0 to 9, so each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the units place. For the tens digit 8, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so digits 0-8 appear once each. Therefore, in the units place, for the 400-488 range, 4 appears once (as 48) and 8 appears once (as 88), but wait, that's not correct because 48 is in the units place as 48, but the units digit is 8, not 4. Wait, no, the units digit is the last digit, so 48 would be units digit 8, and 44 would be units digit 4. So, in the tens digit 4, units digit 4 is 44, which is within 400-488. Similarly, in tens digit 8, units digit 4 would be 484, which is within 488, so 484 is included, so units digit 4 appears once in the tens digit 8's units place. Similarly, units digit 8 appears once in tens digit 8's units place (488).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it differently. For the units place in 400-488:\n\n- For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once in each of these tens groups, totaling 8 times (since 0-7 is 8 tens digits). Similarly, 8 appears once in each of these, so 8 times.\n\n- For the tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and units digit 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nSo, total units digit 4's in 400-488: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in each tens group from 0-7, units digits 0-9 are present, so 4 and 8 each appear once per tens group. So, 8 tens groups (0-7) would give 8 occurrences each for 4 and 8. Then, in the 80-88 group, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units digit 4's: 8 +1=9, and units digit 8's:8 +1=9.\n\nWait, but that would mean in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times in the 400-488 range. But let me check with an example. For tens digit 0: 400-409, units digits 0-9, so 404 is 4 in units, and 408 is 8 in units. Similarly, for tens digit 1: 410-419, 414 has 4, 418 has 8. This continues up to tens digit 7: 470-479, 474 and 478. Then, for tens digit 8: 480-488, units digits 0-8. So, 484 has 4, and 488 has 8. So, yes, that's 8 times from tens 0-7, and 1 each from tens 8, totaling 9 each.\n\nSo, in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the units place across all three-digit numbers. The first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each have 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the units place. So, 3*10=30 for 4's and 30 for 8's. Then, in 400-488, as we saw, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total units digit 4's: 30 +9=39, and 8's:30+9=39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 had 9 each, so adding to the first three hundreds, that's 30+9=39 each. So, units place contributes 39 each.\n\nNow, let's add up all the places for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check the math:\n\n89 +40=129, +39=168.\n\n0 +39=39, +39=78.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n4's:1, 8's:1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's:19, 8's:19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:168, 8's:78.\n\nSo, total 4's:1 +19 +168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1+19=20, +168=188.\n\n1+19=20, +78=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which is correct because from 400-488, that's 89 pages. Tens place: 40 times for 4's and 39 for 8's. Units place:39 each.\n\nSo, 4's:89+40+39=168, 8's:0+39+39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's:1+19=20, 8's:1+19=20.\n\nTotal 4's:20+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place in three-digit numbers. Did I count correctly?\n\nIn the first three hundreds (100-399), each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place, so 30 each.\n\nIn 400-488, units digits for 4's:9 times, 8's:9 times.\n\nSo, total units place:30+9=39 each.\n\nSimilarly, tens place: in 100-399, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in tens place, so 30 each.\n\nIn 400-488, tens place:4's=10, 8's=9.\n\nSo, total tens place:30+10=40 for 4's, 30+9=39 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168.\n\n8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any pages. For example, in the three-digit numbers, 400-488, how many pages is that? 488-400+1=89 pages. So, 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated, 40 times for 4's, 39 for 8's.\n\nIn the units place, 39 each.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times (once per ten pages), so 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-399) and 10 times in 400-488, totaling 40 times.\n     - 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** \n     - 4 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n     - 8 appears similarly 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me structure this by looking at each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe that will make it easier to count without missing any numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nSo, in the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each set of 10) plus 1 if the extra numbers include a 4. Wait, the extra numbers go up to 488, so the units digits in the extra set are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, there is a 4 in the units place once. Therefore, total 4's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: each set of 10 has one 8, so 48 times 1 is 48. The extra numbers include an 8 in the units place (488), so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times. That's interesting. So, so far, the count is equal for both digits in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's calculate. Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, in 400 pages, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. Each hundred is 100 numbers, so 488 pages would have 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages from 401 to 488.\n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So, that's 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place from 1-400. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, how many 4's are there beyond the first 400 pages? Let me think. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 numbers (441,442,...,450). Wait, but 450 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 occurrences. So, in the tens place beyond 400, we have 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 441-450), totaling 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, in the tens place from 401-488, the 4's in the tens place are from 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, how about the digit 8 in the tens place? From 1-488, each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, in 1-100, it's 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 180-189, and so on up to 400. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 more times beyond the 400 pages. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's in tens place: 50, and 8's in tens place: 48. So, 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more. So, total 48. So, yes, 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place, from 1-400, it's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making it 50. So, yes, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's appear 48 times. So, 2 more 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, 97 8's.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 numbers have 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers.\n- Units 4's: 48 +1=49\n- Units 8's: 48 +1=49\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 numbers have 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 488 pages: 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488).\n- For fours in tens place:\n  - 4*10=40 from 1-400\n  - From 401-488, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so +10\n  - Total 50\n- For eights in tens place:\n  - 4*10=40 from 1-400\n  - From 401-488, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so +8\n  - Total 48\nSo, 50 fours and 48 eights in tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- 8's: 0, since the book doesn't go up to 800.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 488, plus 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 488 pages include 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 extra pages (401-488).\n   - 4's: 4*10 = 40 from 1-400, plus 10 from 441-450, totaling 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 = 40 from 1-400, plus 8 from 481-488, totaling 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n   - 8's: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and how many times the digit 8 appears in each place. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 pages, the digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but the total number of pages is 488, so let's see. For the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8).\n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Similarly, for 8's, it's 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 8's in the remaining 8 pages.\n\nLooking at the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra pages, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each block of 100. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit again cycles through 0-9 ten times each, and so on.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, for each hundred, 10 times each digit. Therefore, for 4 hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10=40, and similarly, 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's break this down further. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages, so from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, we'll stop at 488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. But wait, in the 401-488 range, 440-449 would be pages 440 to 449. So, that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. However, since our upper limit is 488, we don't have any issues with that range. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 440-449.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449) = 50. For 8's, it's 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. Each complete hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be less. Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last set (tens digit 8) only has 8 pages (481-488). So, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me list the ranges:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-490: tens digit 8 (but only up to 488, so 8 pages)\n\nWait, so from 401-488, the tens digits go through 0-8, but the last one (tens digit 8) only has 8 pages. So, for each tens digit from 0-7, they appear 10 times each, and tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, within 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48\n\nWait, earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 49, but now I'm getting 48. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recount. Each complete hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds mean 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, which is 401-488, the tens digits go through 0-8, but the last one (8) is cut short. So, for digit 4 in the tens place, it appears once in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For digit 8, it appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9.\n\nWait, so that would mean digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the last set was 8 pages. Hmm, I'm confused now. Let me clarify.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 has 10 pages, and the tens digit 8 has 9 pages (480-488). So, digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times in 440-449, so 10 times. Therefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in tens place were 50, and 8's were 49, so the difference would be 1. But let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the hundreds place as well. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore it. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears as follows:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 numbers)\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (100 numbers)\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (100 numbers)\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 numbers, since 488-400+1=89)\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times (from 400-488). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, which is still in the 400s. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 to the count of 4's and 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 49, but let me double-check that. From the units place, both 4 and 8 had 49 each. In the tens place, 4 had 50 and 8 had 49. In the hundreds place, 4 had 89 and 8 had 0. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188; 8's: 49+49+0=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\nEach 10 pages, units digit cycles 0-9. So, number of complete 10s: 48 (since 48*10=480). Remaining pages: 8 (481-488).\n\nIn units place:\n- 4 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times in complete blocks.\n- In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\nTotal 4's in units: 48 +1=49\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n- 48 times in complete blocks.\n- In remaining pages, 8 appears once (488).\nTotal 8's in units:48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 pages, tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each.\n\nTotal complete hundreds:4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in tens place.\n\nSo, 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nRemaining pages:401-488 (88 pages).\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last set is 8 pages (481-488).\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0-7, they appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nThus, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449)\n- 8 appears 8 times (in 480-488)\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50\nTotal 8's in tens place:40 +8=48\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 49 for 8's, but now I'm getting 48. Which is correct?\n\nWait, in the remaining 88 pages, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 +1=9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488). Therefore, total 8's in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but how does that reconcile with the earlier breakdown? Let me think.\n\nIf from 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-490: tens digit 8 (but only up to 488, so 9 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times (481-489, but only up to 488). Therefore, in the tens place, 8's count is 9 in the remaining pages, so total 40 +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449, so 10 in the remaining pages, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSo, total 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total=49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and there are 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4.\n\nTherefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 to 4's and 0 to 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should count the number of times each digit appears in each place separately.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n- Total numbers:488\n- For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, with a remainder of 8.\n- So, for digits 0-9, each appears 48 times, plus 1 more time if the digit is <=8 (since the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 get an extra count in the units place).\nWait, actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so for numbers 1-488, the units digits go from 1-9 in the first 9 numbers, then 0-9 in each subsequent block of 10.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place:\n\nFor d=0: It appears floor(488/10)=48 times, but since page numbers start at 1, the first page is 1, so 0 doesn't appear in the units place for page 1. So, actually, 0 appears 48 times (from 10,20,...480). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480 is included, so 0 appears 48 times in units place.\n\nFor d=1-9: Each digit appears floor(488/10)=48 times, plus an additional 1 if the digit is <= (488 mod 10). Since 488 mod 10=8, so digits 1-8 get an extra count, and 9 doesn't.\n\nTherefore, for units place:\n\n- 0:48\n- 1-8:48+1=49 each\n- 9:48\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 49 times in units place, and 8 appears 49 times as well.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/100)*10=4*10=40 times in each block of 100. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for each tens digit:\n\n- 0:10 (401-410)\n- 1:10 (411-420)\n- 2:10 (421-430)\n- 3:10 (431-440)\n- 4:10 (441-450)\n- 5:10 (451-460)\n- 6:10 (461-470)\n- 7:10 (471-480)\n- 8:8 (481-488)\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- Digit 4 in tens place:10\n- Digit 8 in tens place:8\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- 4:40 +10=50\n- 8:40 +8=48\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 49, but now it's 48. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again. The total number of pages is 488, so in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, which is 401-488, the tens digits go through 0-8, with 0-7 each appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 8 times. So, for digit 4 in tens place:10, digit 8:8.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50\nTotal 8's in tens place:40+8=48\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 49 because I considered 480-488 as 9 pages, but actually, 480-488 is 9 pages, but in the tens place, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, but in the remaining 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the number of pages where tens digit is 8 is 9 (480-488). So, why did I get 8 earlier?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier breakdown. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but only up to 488, so 8 pages (481-488)\n\nWait, that's 8 pages, not 9. Because 488 -481 +1=8.\n\nWait, no, 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488: that's 8 pages.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, but 480 is included in the previous block (401-488). Wait, no, 480 is in the 400-488 range, so in the 401-488 range, 480 is included.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the pages:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but only up to 488\n\nSo, 481-488 is 8 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480 is in the 471-480 block? No, 471-480 is tens digit 7, so 480 is actually in the 481-490 block? Wait, no, 480 is in the 480-489 range, which would be tens digit 8. Wait, no, 480 is in the 480-489 block, but in our case, we're only going up to 488.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but only up to 488, so 8 pages (481-488)\n\nSo, in the 481-490 block, we only have 8 pages (481-488), so tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nNow, moving to the hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit doesn't exist, so 0 for both 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit 1 (100 numbers)\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit 2 (100 numbers)\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit 3 (100 numbers)\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit 4 (89 numbers)\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, total counts:\n\n- 4's: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 188\n- 8's: units 49 + tens 48 + hundreds 0 = 97\n\nWait, wait, earlier I thought 8's in tens place were 48, so total 8's would be 49 (units) +48 (tens) =97, not 98. Did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, now I'm getting a different answer. Earlier I thought 8's were 98, but now it's 97. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let's recount the 8's in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nTherefore, total 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 98. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place.\n\nTotal pages:488\n\nFor units digit, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times. The remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 get an extra count in the units place.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- 0:48\n- 1-8:48+1=49 each\n- 9:48\n\nSo, digit 8 appears 49 times in the units place, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the complete hundreds. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, as we've determined, digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens)=97.\n\nTherefore, total 4's:188\nTotal 8's:97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, but now it's 97. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me think again.\n\nTotal pages:488.\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place:\n\nFor d=0: floor(488/10)=48 times (pages 10,20,...480)\nFor d=1-9: floor(488/10)=48 times, plus 1 if d <= (488 mod 10)=8.\n\nSo, for d=1-8:48+1=49\nFor d=9:48\n\nTherefore, digit 8 appears 49 times in units place.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8, with 0-7 each appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 8 times.\n\nTherefore, digit 8 in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+48=97.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90. So, which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write a small program or use a formula to calculate the exact count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for digit frequency.\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nfloor(N/10)*1 + min(max(d, N%10 +1), d+1)\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the number of times a digit appears in each position can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count is:\n\nhigher = N divided by the position's base (10, 100, 1000)\ncurrent = (N / position's base) % 10\nlower = N % position's base\n\ncount = higher * position's base /10\n\nif current > d: count += position's base /10\nif current == d: count += lower +1\n\nBut since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, and not all digits, perhaps it's easier to calculate separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, contributing 48*1=48.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484).\nTotal:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488/100=4.88, so 4 full cycles, contributing 4*10=40.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0-8.\n- In the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages.\nTotal:40+10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Each 1000 pages, but since we're only going to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\nTotal:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 8 appears once. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, contributing 48*"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the different digit places separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears once. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. But wait, there's an extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488), so the units digit goes from 1 to 8. In this extra set, 4 doesn't appear in the units place, but 8 does. So, that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. The total number of pages is 488, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of times 4 is in the units digit across all page numbers. Similarly for 8.\n\nSo, for units place:\nNumber of 4's = number of times 4 appears in units digit from 1 to 488.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's = number of times 8 appears in units digit from 1 to 488.\n\nSince every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear, but 8 does. So, that's one more 8. So total units place: 48 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but the first page is 1, so does 0 appear as a units digit? No, because page 10 is the first page with a 0 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 9, then 0, etc. So, the count for 4 and 8 in the units place is correct as 48 each, except that in the last partial set, 481-488, 4 doesn't appear, but 8 does. So, 48 4's and 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each block of 100, and similarly for 8.\n\nSo, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, from 401 to 488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: from 401 to 410, the tens digit is 0, then 411-420 is 1, 421-430 is 2, 431-440 is 3, 441-450 is 4, 451-460 is 5, 461-470 is 6, 471-480 is 7, and 481-488 is 8. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? That would be in 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 8 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 4's. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is the start, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit is 8, and 481 is 4-8-1, so yes, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but now I'm getting 9. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place contributions: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought from 401-488, the tens place had 10 4's and 8 8's, but now I'm getting 9 8's. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 40 4's and 40 8's from 1-400, then 10 4's and 9 8's from 401-488, so total 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be required for 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total hundreds place contributions: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place:\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's in units place? It's the number of times 4 appears as the last digit. Since every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, units digit 8 appears once (488), so total 49.\n\nTens place:\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's in tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n8's: 0, as discussed.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place. Let me check: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, 49 in total for 8's in tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place, from 401-488, it's 10 times (440-449). So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nUnits place: 48 4's, 49 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place:**\n   - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10, giving 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once more.\n   - Total units place: 48 4's, 49 8's.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, giving 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total tens place: 50 4's, 49 8's.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the hundreds place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times (no page numbers in 800-899).\n\n4. **Sum the totals:**\n   - Total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Find the difference:**\n   - 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the ranges. Pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, pages 10 to 99 are two-digit, and pages 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. I guess I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately and then add them up to get the total.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the only single-digit numbers that have a 4 or an 8 are 4 and 8 themselves. So, for single-digit pages, there is exactly one 4 and one 8. That means the count for 4's is 1 and for 8's is also 1. So, the difference here is 0.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 1 to 9, and the units digit can be 0 to 9. So, for each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: The numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: The numbers would be 80 to 89. Again, that's 10 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit can be 0 to 9, and the tens digit can be 1 to 9. So, for each digit in the units place, there are 9 possible tens digits. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the units place: It appears in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: It appears in 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. The total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. So, the difference here is 0 as well.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the hundreds place: It appears in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: Wait, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're going up to 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Hmm, this might complicate things a bit. Let me think.\n\nActually, perhaps it's easier to split the three-digit numbers into two parts: from 100 to 399 and from 400 to 488. Because from 100 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, and the tens and units digits can be 0 to 9. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0 to 8, with the units digit varying accordingly.\n\nLet me handle the tens place first. Let's consider the tens digit for 4's and 8's separately.\n\nStarting with the digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nFor numbers from 100 to 399: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, or 3. For each of these, the tens digit is 4, and the units digit can be 0 to 9. So, for each hundreds digit, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Since there are 3 hundreds digits (1, 2, 3), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nFor numbers from 400 to 488: The hundreds digit is 4. The tens digit is 4, and the units digit can be 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but when the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be 0 to 9, but since the maximum is 488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8. Hmm, but wait, in this case, we're looking at the tens digit being 4, so the units digit can be 0 to 9 regardless because 440 to 449 are all within 488. So, that's 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but actually, from 400 to 488, the tens digit can be 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 4, the units digit can be 0 to 9 because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 10 numbers. So, total for 4 in the tens place is 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nFor numbers from 100 to 399: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. For each, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit can be 0 to 9. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nFor numbers from 400 to 488: The hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit is 8. Now, the units digit can be 0 to 8 because the maximum page is 488. So, that's 9 numbers (0-8). Therefore, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nSo, total for 8 in the tens place is 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4 in the tens place, I had 40 times, and for 8 in the tens place, I have 39 times. So, the difference here is 40 - 39 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor the digit 4 in the units place:\n\nIn numbers from 100 to 399: Each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3) has 10 possible tens digits (0-9), and for each tens digit, the units digit can be 4 once. So, that's 3 * 10 * 1 = 30 times.\n\nIn numbers from 400 to 488: The hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the units digit can be 4 once. So, that's 9 (tens digits 0-8) * 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can go up to 8, so 4 is still possible. So, yes, 9 times. So, total for 4 in the units place is 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the units place:\n\nIn numbers from 100 to 399: Each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3) has 10 possible tens digits (0-9), and for each tens digit, the units digit can be 8 once. So, that's 3 * 10 * 1 = 30 times.\n\nIn numbers from 400 to 488: The hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the units digit can be 8 once. So, that's 9 (tens digits 0-8) * 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can go up to 8, so 8 is included. So, yes, 9 times. So, total for 8 in the units place is 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each. So, the difference here is 0.\n\nNow, let's summarize the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition.\n\nFor 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 0 + 39 = 39; 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times and 8's appear 78 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188 and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1 each, correct.\n\nTwo-digit: 10 + 9 = 19 for 4's, same for 8's. Correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, 30 (100-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40. For 8's, 30 (100-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For 4's, 30 (100-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. For 8's, same, 30 +9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: 89 +40+39=168. Three-digit 8's: 0+39+39=78.\n\nAdding up all:\n\n4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference between these counts is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits are there in total for each place: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think it's best to approach this by looking at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014and count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place. Then, I can add them up and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 fours and 48 eights. \n\nNow, looking at the extra numbers from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 8 appears once (488), and the digit 4 doesn't appear because the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Wait, actually, 484 is in this range, so the units digit 4 does appear once here. So, in the extra 8 numbers, we have one 4 and one 8. \n\nSo, adding that up, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, in the units place, the counts are equal.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. \n\nIn each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 fours. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10 = 40 eights. \n\nNow, looking at the last partial hundred, 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 fours. \n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred. \n\nWait, no, hold on. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10 except for the last one, which might be less. \n\nWait, actually, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440 is included and 449 is included, so that's 10 pages. \n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 480 is the first and 488 is the last. So, that's 9 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, the fours are 10 in the partial hundred, and the eights are 9. \n\nTherefore, adding to the previous counts: fours in tens place are 40 (from the 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 fours. \n\nEights in tens place are 40 (from the 4 hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 eights. \n\nWait, that's a bit confusing. Let me clarify. \n\nEach full hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds contribute 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights. \n\nNow, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. \n\nThe tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights. \n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the partial hundred, we're only considering the tens digit. So, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. \n\nFor each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10 except for the last one, which might be less. \n\nSo, for tens digit 4: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. \n\nFor tens digit 8: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. \n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, fours in tens place: 50, eights: 49. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. \n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-9, 1 for 10-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). But wait, how does that translate to the hundreds digit? \n\nEach page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. \n\nSimilarly, the hundreds digit 8 would appear in pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, fours appear 89 times, and eights appear 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with fours:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, eights:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference between the number of fours and eights is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete tens: 488 // 10 = 48, with a remainder of 8.\n\nIn each complete ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48*1=48 for each.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-400). So, 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\nFor tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, tens place total: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (400 is the first, 488 is the last). So, 89 fours.\n\nEights in hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 isn't in the book.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place count. Let me check again.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of eights is 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer would be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the total number of digits printed and then see how many of each digit there are.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, but since I'm doing this manually, let me just recheck each place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. For 488 pages, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times for each digit, plus an extra 8 pages where digits 1-8 appear once each. So, digits 0-8 get an extra one, but since we're only considering 4 and 8, 4 appears once more (48+1=49) and 8 appears once more (48+1=49). Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but in the partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nEights in tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 fours.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for pages 1-480.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 fours (440-449) and 9 eights (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n   - No pages have an 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by figuring out how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each position: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit separately and then compare them.\n\nStarting with the digit '4':\n\n1. **Units place**: For every block of 10 pages, the digit '4' appears exactly once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, since the book has 488 pages, the number of times '4' appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra pages beyond that. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one '4' in the units place, and then pages 481 to 488, which includes page 484. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, looking at the tens place. The digit '4' appears in the tens place for every block of 100 pages, specifically from page 40 to 49, 140 to 149, and so on. Each such block has 10 occurrences of '4' in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's in the tens place. That's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, we also have pages 400 to 488, which is another partial block. From 400 to 488, the tens digit is '4' for pages 400 to 409, which is 10 pages. So, adding that, we get 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds place can only be '4' in the pages from 400 to 488. Each of these pages has '4' in the hundreds place. Now, how many pages are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up for '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit '8':\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to '4', in the units place, '8' appears once every 10 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, '8' appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, the last partial block is pages 481 to 488, which includes page 488. So, that's one more '8', making it 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens place, '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 '8's in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 '8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, looking at the partial block from 400 to 488, the tens digit is '8' only in the range 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but actually, 480 to 489 would be a full block, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages. So, that's 9 '8's in the tens place. So, total '8's in the tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit can be '8' only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no '8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up for '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more '4's there are than '8's, subtract the total number of '8's from the total number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor '4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades (480 pages) plus page 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (400 pages) each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 from 400-409, totaling 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 pages (400-488), so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor '8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades, plus page 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (40), plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more '4's are printed than '8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**For the digit '4':**\n- **Units place:** Appears once every 10 pages. With 48 full decades and one extra page (484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** Appears in blocks like 40-49, contributing 10 '4's per block. With 4 full blocks and an additional 10 pages (400-409), totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** Appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**For the digit '8':**\n- **Units place:** Appears once every 10 pages, totaling 49 times (including page 488).\n- **Tens place:** Appears in blocks like 80-89, contributing 10 '8's per block. With 4 full blocks and 9 extra pages (480-488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** Does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits each page number has. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, so that's 9 pages. Pages 10 through 99 are two-digit numbers, which is 90 pages. Then, pages 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers, which is 488 - 99 = 389 pages. Wait, but 100 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages. That makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me tackle the digit 4 first. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and a partial set of 8 numbers (481 to 488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 484 is in this range, which adds another 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in each hundred. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times every 100 pages. Let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1 to 488, that's four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each full hundred contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is fully within 401-488. Wait, actually, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but hold on, 401-488 is only 88 pages, so does 440-449 fit entirely within that? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and 449 is less than 488. So yes, that's 10 more, making it 50.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when considering the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times, but in the 401-488 range, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, total tens place 4's are 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but actually, from 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so total 50. That seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only for page numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial set from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. From 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's correct, 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because I feel like 8's might be less than 4's, but let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the tens place in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188, which is more than 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me double-check the 4's count:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-400) is 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, plus one in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 hundreds contributing 10 each, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. So, that's 10 more, making it 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making it 49.\n\nWait, but in the units place, for 4's, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484, so that's correct.\n\nFor 8's, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check the hundreds place again.\n\nFor 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, correct.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so zero.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, so 48 complete sets, plus 484, which is the 49th. So, 49.\n\nUnits place for 8's: same logic, 48 complete sets, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: 4 hundreds contributing 10 each, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 hundreds contributing 10 each, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4: 48.\n   - The partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding one more: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - 440-449 in 401-488 adds 10 more: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488 has 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8: 48.\n   - The partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding one more: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - 480-488 in 401-488 adds 9 more: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for single-digit pages, the count of 4's and 8's is equal, each being 1. That means the difference so far is zero.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a ones place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4 or 8. If the tens digit is 4, the numbers range from 40 to 49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, if the tens digit is 8, the numbers range from 80 to 89, also 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, for the ones place in two-digit numbers: Here, 4 and 8 can appear in the ones place for each set of ten numbers. For example, in 10-19, the number 14 has a 4, and 18 has an 8. This pattern repeats every ten numbers. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit range (10-99), each digit (4 and 8) appears 9 times in the ones place. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, for each digit, in the ones place, it's 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8. But wait, that doesn't seem right because from 10 to 99, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the ones place, except for the first set where 0 is included. Wait, no, actually, in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the ones place. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29,...90-99), so each digit appears 9 times in the ones place. So, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the ones place for two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 10 to 19, the ones digits go from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once (14) and 8 appears once (18). Similarly, in 20-29, 4 appears once (24) and 8 once (28). This continues up to 90-99, where 4 appears once (94) and 8 once (98). So, that's 9 times each for both 4 and 8 in the ones place. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 times. So, the count is equal again, so the difference remains zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and ones places to consider.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many three-digit page numbers there are. From 100 to 488, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers. But I think it's better to break this down by hundreds place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nI'll handle each hundred separately.\n\nStarting with 100-199: The hundreds digit is 1. So, let's look at the tens and ones digits.\n\nIn the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear? For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, for the tens digit:\n\n- When tens digit is 4: Numbers are 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- When tens digit is 8: Numbers are 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nIn the ones place, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. So, in 100-199, 4 appears 10 times (once in each ten's group, e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194) and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198).\n\nSo, in 100-199, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 10 (ones) = 20 times, and 8 appears 10 (tens) + 10 (ones) = 20 times. So, equal again.\n\nNext, 200-299: Similar to 100-199. Tens digit:\n\n- 4 appears in 240-249: 10 times.\n- 8 appears in 280-289: 10 times.\n\nOnes digit:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (204, 214, ..., 294).\n- 8 appears 10 times (208, 218, ..., 298).\n\nSo, 4: 10 + 10 = 20, 8: 10 + 10 = 20. Equal.\n\nNow, 300-399: Same approach.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- 4: 340-349: 10 times.\n- 8: 380-389: 10 times.\n\nOnes digit:\n\n- 4: 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 times.\n- 8: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 times.\n\nSo, 4: 20, 8: 20. Equal.\n\nNow, the last set is 400-488. This is a bit trickier because it doesn't go up to 499, only to 488. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds digit is 4, so from 400 to 488.\n\nLet me break this down into tens and ones places.\n\nStarting with the tens place:\n\n- When the tens digit is 0: 400-409. Here, 4 appears in the hundreds place, but we're considering the tens place. So, 4 doesn't appear in the tens place here. The ones place in 400-409: 404 is a 4, and 408 is an 8. So, in 400-409, 4 appears once in the ones place, and 8 appears once in the ones place.\n\nWait, but actually, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let me structure this properly.\n\nIn the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- The tens digits can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. But since the last page is 488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488.\n\nSo, let's go through each possible tens digit:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409. Here, 400-409 is 10 numbers. In the tens place, 0 appears, so 4 and 8 don't appear here in the tens place. But in the ones place, 4 appears once (404) and 8 appears once (408).\n\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419. Similarly, in the tens place, 1 appears, so no 4 or 8. In the ones place, 4 appears once (414) and 8 once (418).\n\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429. Ones place: 424 and 428.\n\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439. Ones place: 434 and 438.\n\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449. Here, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449). Also, in the ones place, each number from 440-449 has a ones digit from 0-9, so 4 appears once (444) and 8 appears once (448).\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times. In the ones place, 4 appears once (444) and 8 appears once (448).\n\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459. Ones place: 454 and 458.\n\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469. Ones place: 464 and 468.\n\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479. Ones place: 474 and 478.\n\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488. Here, the tens digit is 8, so 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). In the ones place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10.\n\nSo, let's summarize the counts for 400-488.\n\nFirst, hundreds digit is 4, so every page number is 4XY, where X is the tens digit and Y is the ones digit.\n\nLet's count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nHundreds place: Every number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So, 4 appears 89 times here (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers). 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place here because all numbers are 4XX.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place when X=4 (440-449), which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- 8 appears in the tens place when X=8 (480-488), which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nOnes place:\n\nFor each tens group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the ones digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each group, 4 appears once in the ones place, and 8 appears once.\n\nBut wait, in the last group, 480-488, the ones digits go from 0-8, so 484 is present, but 488 is the last number. So, in the ones place for 480-488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the ones place, except perhaps the last group if it's cut short.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n- For X=0 (400-409): ones digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404), 8 once (408).\n- X=1 (410-419): same, 414 and 418.\n- X=2: 424, 428.\n- X=3: 434, 438.\n- X=4: 444, 448.\n- X=5: 454, 458.\n- X=6: 464, 468.\n- X=7: 474, 478.\n- X=8: 480-488: ones digits 0-8, so 484 and 488.\n\nSo, each X group from 0 to 8 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the ones place, except that when X=8, the ones digits only go up to 8, so 488 is included. Therefore, each of the 9 X groups (0-8) contributes one 4 and one 8 in the ones place. So, total in ones place: 9 4's and 9 8's.\n\nWait, but let me count how many X groups there are. From X=0 to X=8, that's 9 groups. Each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the ones place, so 9 each.\n\nSo, in the ones place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n- Ones place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 400-488:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 108 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 18 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 8's in the tens place are 9 times and ones place 9 times, so 18 total.\n\nBut let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's there.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nOnes place: 9 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488: 89 + 10 + 9 = 108.\n\nTotal 8's in 400-488: 9 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 18.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts from all page ranges.\n\nFirst, single-digit: 1-9.\n\n4's: 1 (page 4)\n8's: 1 (page 8)\nDifference so far: 0.\n\nTwo-digit: 10-99.\n\n4's: 19 (as calculated earlier)\n8's: 19\nDifference: 0.\n\nThree-digit: 100-488.\n\nBut wait, I just calculated 400-488, but I also need to include 100-399.\n\nWait, no, earlier I broke down three-digit into 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each had 20 4's and 20 8's.\n\nSo, 3 sets of 20 each, so 3*20=60 4's and 3*20=60 8's.\n\nThen, 400-488: 108 4's and 18 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 60 + 108 = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 60 + 18 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit counts.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n4's: 1\n8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's: 19\n8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's: 168\n8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because 188 - 98 = 90, but let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, let me re-add:\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n4's: 1\n8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's: 19\n8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n100-199: 20 4's, 20 8's\n200-299: 20 4's, 20 8's\n300-399: 20 4's, 20 8's\n400-488: 108 4's, 18 8's\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: 20 + 20 + 20 + 108 = 168\nThree-digit 8's: 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78\n\nNow, total 4's: single (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (168) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: single (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in 400-488, I had 89 4's in the hundreds place, 10 in the tens place (440-449), and 9 in the ones place, totaling 108.\n\n8's in 400-488: 9 in the tens place (480-488) and 9 in the ones place, totaling 18.\n\nThen, three-digit before 400: 100-399, which is three sets of 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each had 20 4's and 20 8's, so 3*20=60 each.\n\nSo, 60 + 108 = 168 4's in three-digit.\n\n60 + 18 = 78 8's in three-digit.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Tens place: 4 and 8 each appear 10 times (40-49, 80-89).\n   - Ones place: Each digit appears 9 times in each set of ten (e.g., 14, 18).\n   - Total for two-digit: 19 each.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **100-199, 200-299, 300-399:**\n     - Each has 20 4's and 20 8's.\n     - Total: 60 each.\n   - **400-488:**\n     - Hundreds place: 89 4's.\n     - Tens place: 10 4's, 9 8's.\n     - Ones place: 9 4's, 9 8's.\n     - Total: 108 4's, 18 8's.\n   - Total three-digit: 168 4's, 78 8's.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by determining how many times the digit 4 appears in each position\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is roughly the total number of pages divided by 10. \n\nCalculating that, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I think I should take the integer part, which is 48, but wait, actually, when you have 488 pages, the units digit cycles 48 full times (from 1 to 480), and then there's a partial cycle from 481 to 488. So, in each full cycle of 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 full cycles, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the partial cycle from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1 through 8 appear once each, and 9 and 0 don't appear in this partial cycle.\n\nWait, but actually, page 480 is included in the 48th cycle, so the 48th cycle ends at 480. Then, the next pages are 481 (units digit 1), 482 (2), up to 488 (8). So, in the units place, digits 1 through 8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear here.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the full cycles) plus 1 (from the partial cycle, since 484 would have a units digit of 4 in the partial cycle? Wait, no, 481 is 1, 482 is 2, so 484 is 4 in the units place. So yes, 4 appears once more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place 8's, in the full cycles, each 8 appears 48 times, and in the partial cycle, 488 is the last page, which has a units digit of 8. So, that's one more 8. So, units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, the first page is 1, so the units digits start at 1 and go up. So, in the first cycle, from 1 to 10, units digits are 1-9 and 0. So, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place every 10 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many full cycles are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, and then 8 more pages. So, in each full cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, yes, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, the units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-488). \n\nWait, let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages. So, for the tens digit in the remaining 88 pages:\n- 0 appears 10 times (401-410)\n- 1 appears 10 times (411-420)\n- 2 appears 10 times (421-430)\n- 3 appears 10 times (431-440)\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 5 appears 10 times (451-460)\n- 6 appears 10 times (461-470)\n- 7 appears 10 times (471-480)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so yes, 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the 488 pages:\n- 4 appears 40 times (from the 4 full hundreds) plus 10 times in 441-450, so total 50 times.\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the 4 full hundreds (1-400) each have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit for 4 is 10 times (441-450). So, total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, in the 4 full hundreds, 4*10 = 40 times. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 481-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, so that's correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers 100 and above. So, for pages 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 48 = +2\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 full cycles (480 pages) give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 (at 484) and 1 more 8 (at 488). So, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times (441-450), so total 50. For 8, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (481-488), so 40 + 8 = 48. So, 50 - 48 = +2.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. So, 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nAdding up: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times (441-450). So, 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50. For 8, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages (481-488). So, 40 + 8 = 48. So, yes, 50 - 48 = +2.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because when I think about the units place, in the last partial cycle, 481-488, the units digit is 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units place: 48 +1=49, 8's:48 +1=49, so no difference.\n\nTens place: 50-48=+2.\n\nHundreds place:89-0=+89.\n\nTotal:91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place (from 1 to 400).\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = +2\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: No hundreds digit.\n   - Pages 100-399: Hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +2\n- Hundreds: +89\n- Combined: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I can approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 also appears once. Since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to get 48 full sets of 10 pages, and then there are 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each full set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 sets, that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So in the units place, there's one more 8 but no additional 4. So in total, units place contributes 48 4's and 49 8's. \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is the last page. So from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 doesn't appear in the units place in these last 8 pages, but 8 does appear once. So units place total is 48 4's and 49 8's. \n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each ten pages. So in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the last 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. So for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, no, 480-488 is actually 9 pages (480, 481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. \n\nSo in the last 88 pages, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 9 8's. \n\nAdding that to the previous 40, the total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So yes, 10 4's and 9 8's in the tens place for the last 88 pages. \n\nSo total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 8's. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 for 400-488. \n\nWait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nThe digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So in the hundreds place, we have 89 4's and 0 8's. \n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits. \n\nFor the units place: 48 4's and 49 8's. \n\nFor the tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's. \n\nFor the hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's. \n\nAdding them all together: \n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. \n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. \n\nSo the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. \n\nThe difference is 187 - 98 = 89. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, plus the last 8 pages contributing 1 more 8. So 48 + 1 = 49 8's in units, and 48 4's. \n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then the last 88 pages contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488). So total tens: 50 4's and 49 8's. \n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear. \n\nSo total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. \n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 = 98. \n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units digits. \n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So for 488 pages, that's 48 full cycles of 10, and 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So 48 cycles give 48 4's and 48 8's. \n\nIn the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nWait, so in the units place, the last 8 pages contribute 1 4 and 1 8. So total units: 48 +1 =49 4's and 48 +1=49 8's. \n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So units place: 49 4's and 49 8's. \n\nThen, tens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then the last 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 to 8. \n\nWhen the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449: 10 pages, so 10 4's. \n\nWhen the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488: 9 pages, so 9 8's. \n\nSo tens place total: 40 +10=50 4's and 40 +9=49 8's. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's. \n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. \n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. \n\nDifference: 188 -98=90. \n\nWait, now I'm getting a different answer. I think I made a mistake earlier in the units place. Let me clarify. \n\nWhen counting the units digits, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? \n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488 /10 =48 full tens, with 8 remaining pages. \n\nIn each full ten, 4 appears once. So 48 times. \n\nIn the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So 4 appears once (484). \n\nSo total units 4's:48 +1=49. \n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once in each ten, so 48 times, plus once in 488. So 48 +1=49. \n\nSo units place:49 4's and 49 8's. \n\nTens place: \n\nEach hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So 4 hundreds:40 each. \n\nIn the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. \n\nWhen the tens digit is 4: 440-449:10 pages, so 10 4's. \n\nWhen the tens digit is 8:480-488:9 pages, so 9 8's. \n\nSo tens place total:40 +10=50 4's and 40 +9=49 8's. \n\nHundreds place: \n\n400-488:89 pages, so 89 4's. \n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. \n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. \n\nDifference:188 -98=90. \n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Which is correct? \n\nI think the correct answer is 90, because in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Then in the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49. In the hundreds place, 4's have 89. So total 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49=98. 188-98=90. \n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, right? 488-400+1=89. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. \n\nYes, so 188 total 4's and 98 total 8's. So the difference is 90. \n\nBut wait, I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 89. Let me recount. \n\nUnits place:49 4's and 49 8's. \n\nTens place:50 4's and 49 8's. \n\nHundreds place:89 4's and 0 8's. \n\nAdding up:49+50=99 for 4's, plus 89=188. \n\nFor 8's:49+49=98. \n\nSo 188-98=90. \n\nYes, so the correct difference is 90. \n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by miscalculating the units place, thinking that the last 8 pages only added one 8 and no 4, but actually, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place in those last 8 pages. \n\nSo the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n- The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n- Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n- No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll start by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's in the units place.\n\nBut wait, there's also the extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the units place, we have 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct. Let me think again. The partial block is 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, the total units place counts are:\n\n4's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49\n8's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so maybe the partial block is 481-488, which is 8 pages, so the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, yes, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nHow many hundreds are there in 488 pages? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 fours. Similarly, 8's in the tens place are also 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages are from 401-488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. So, for each ten's place digit, how many times does it appear? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear? Well, from 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8. Wait, let me check:\n\n401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n421-430: tens digit 2, 10 numbers\n431-440: tens digit 3, 10 numbers\n441-450: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n451-460: tens digit 5, 10 numbers\n461-470: tens digit 6, 10 numbers\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 numbers (since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the range 481-488. So, in the tens place for the partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\nTotal fours: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\nTotal eights: 40 (from full hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me double-check. The full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Then, the partial hundred (401-488) has:\n\n- For fours in tens place: 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n- For eights in tens place: 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each page from 1-99 has a hundreds digit of 0, which we can ignore. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 fours.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of eights in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total fours in hundreds place: 89\nTotal eights in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Fours: 49\n- Eights: 49\n\nTens place:\n- Fours: 50\n- Eights: 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- Fours: 89\n- Eights: 0\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\nTotal fours = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\nTotal eights = 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97\n\nSo, total fours printed: 188\nTotal eights printed: 97\n\nThe difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each 10 pages, 1 four and 1 eight. 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n- 48 fours and 48 eights from the full tens.\n- In the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units fours: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Units eights: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 fours (40-49) and 10 eights (80-89).\n- 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n- In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450 (10 pages), so 10 fours.\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 eights.\n- So, tens fours: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Tens eights: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- So, 89 fours.\n- No eights in hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute 1 four and 1 eight.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n   - Fours: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n   - Eights: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 fours (40-49) and 10 eights (80-89).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - In 401-488, fours appear 10 times (441-450), and eights appear 8 times (481-488).\n   - Fours: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Eights: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - Eights never appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Fours: 89\n   - Eights: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 97 eights = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

The first page is 1, which is a one-digit number, and the last page is 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I can split the problem into three parts: one-digit page numbers, two-digit page numbers, and three-digit page numbers. \n\nFor one-digit page numbers, that's pages 1 through 9. In this range, the digits we can have are 1 to 9. So, I need to count how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Well, in the one-digit range, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. That means, in one-digit pages, the count of 4's and 8's is the same, so no difference there.\n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from page 10 to page 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I need to consider both places separately for the digits 4 and 8. \n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, 4 can appear in the units place for each set of ten pages. So, from 10 to 19, 4 appears once (at page 14). Similarly, from 20 to 29, 4 appears once (24), and this pattern continues up to 90-99, where 4 appears at 94. So, that's 9 times in the units place for 4's. Wait, but wait, page 99 is the last two-digit page, so actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. Similarly, for 8's, the same logic applies. From 10 to 19, 8 is at 18; 20-29 at 28, and so on up to 98. That's also 9 times. \n\nNow, for the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in the entire 40-49 range, which is 10 pages (40 to 49), so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the 80-89 range, which is another 10 pages, so 10 times. \n\nSo, adding up the counts for two-digit pages: for 4's, it's 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times. For 8's, it's also 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times. So, in two-digit pages, the counts are equal again. \n\nWait, but hold on, the two-digit pages go up to 99, so that's correct. Now, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from page 100 to 488. This is where it gets a bit more complicated because each page number now has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. \n\nI think I'll need to break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places separately again. Let me start with the units place. For each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each hundred, 4 appears once in the units place (like 104, 114, etc.) and 8 appears once (like 108, 118, etc.). Since the book goes up to 488, that's four full hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred; it's 89 pages. Hmm, so I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, let me check: 488 is the last page, so from 100 to 488, that's actually 389 pages (since 488 - 100 + 1 = 389). But maybe it's better to consider each hundred separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds from 100 to 399, which are three full hundreds, each of 100 pages. So, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Then, the last hundred is 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nSo, for each full hundred (100-199, etc.), in the units place, 4 appears 10 times (once per ten pages, 10 times across 100 pages). Wait, no, actually, in each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the units place (like 104, 114, ..., 194), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198). \n\nSo, for three full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place. So, that's 3 * 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place here. From 400 to 488, the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears once at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, and 484. Wait, but 484 is within 400-488, so that's 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's also 9 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place for 4's in three-digit pages: 30 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 39 times. Similarly, 8's: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit page numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages (like 140-149, 240-249, etc.), so that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (180-189, etc.), so 10 times per hundred.\n\nSo, for the three full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit in 400-488 can be 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, the pages would be 440-449. But wait, 440 to 449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, the pages would be 480-489. But wait, our last page is 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 489 is beyond 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times (from 480 to 488). \n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, adding this to the previous counts: for 4's in the tens place, 30 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 40. For 8's, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's are 40 times and 8's are 39 times. Hmm, that's a difference of 1 so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place in three-digit page numbers. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for each hundred, the hundreds digit is fixed. \n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: only in the 400-488 range, so that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so that's 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: Well, in the range we're considering (100-488), the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800-899 would be beyond 488. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, adding that up: 4's in hundreds place: 89 times. 8's: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts for 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 39 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 39 + 40 + 89 = 168 times.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 39 times\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 39 + 39 + 0 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier in the units and tens places, 4's and 8's were equal in two-digit pages, but in three-digit pages, 4's are more due to the hundreds place. So, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the counts for three-digit pages:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399): 3 * 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n- Partial hundred (400-488): 9 for 4's and 9 for 8's.\nTotal units: 30 + 9 = 39 for 4's and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8's. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Full hundreds: 3 * 10 = 30 for 4's and 30 for 8's.\n- Partial hundred (400-488):\n  - 4 in tens place: 10 times (440-449)\n  - 8 in tens place: 9 times (480-488)\nSo, 4's: 30 + 10 = 40; 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times (400-488)\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 39 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's: 39 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 78.\n\nSo, the difference is 168 - 78 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me cross-verify.\n\nWait, another approach: instead of breaking it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, maybe I can consider all pages from 1 to 488 and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nSo, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total number of tens is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, contributing 48 times, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic. 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and in the last partial ten, 8 appears at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did it per section, I got 39 for units place. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach by separating into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit. Maybe it's better to consider all pages as three-digit numbers, padding with leading zeros for one and two-digit numbers. So, page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, etc. That way, each page number is three digits, and I can count each digit place uniformly.\n\nSo, using this method:\n\nTotal pages: 488, so page numbers from 001 to 488.\n\nBut wait, page 1 is actually 1, not 001, so perhaps leading zeros aren't printed. So, maybe this approach isn't directly applicable. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider each digit place separately without padding.\n\nSo, for the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial cycle, 481-488, 4 appears at 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the units place 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did it per section, I had 39 for units place. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the per-section approach. Let me check.\n\nIn the one-digit pages (1-9), units place: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nIn two-digit pages (10-99), units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), and 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98).\n\nIn three-digit pages (100-488), units place: Let's see, from 100 to 488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nEach hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place, except the last hundred, 400-488, which only goes up to 488.\n\nWait, so 100-199: 10 times 4, 10 times 8.\n\n200-299: same, 10 each.\n\n300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears at 404, 414,...,484. That's 9 times (since 404 + 10*8 = 484, so 9 numbers). Similarly, 8 appears at 408,418,...,488. That's also 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place for 4's: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I considered all pages up to 488, I thought it was 49 each. So, where is the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I see. The issue is that when considering all pages from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 pages) plus a partial cycle. But when I break it down into sections, I get 39 for units place. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's calculate it more carefully.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, total number of tens is 488 // 10 = 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial ten (481-488), 4 appears at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nBut when I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages, I got 39 for units place. So, that must mean I made a mistake in that approach.\n\nWait, in the one-digit pages (1-9), units place: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99): units place, 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488): units place, 4 appears 39 - 1 (since 1-99 had 10+9=19, but wait, no, in the three-digit pages, the units place is 100-488, so units place 4's would be as calculated earlier: 3*10 +9=39. But wait, 100-199: 10 4's, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39.\n\nBut when considering all pages, 1-488, units place 4's: 49, which is 49.\n\nSo, where is the mistake? Oh, I think I see. When I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages, I didn't account for the fact that in the three-digit pages, the units place is part of the 100-488 range, which includes the 100-199, etc., but when I calculated all pages from 1-488, I included the one-digit and two-digit pages as well, which have their own units digits.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages. So, in one-digit pages, units place 4's:1, 8's:1.\n\nTwo-digit pages: units place 4's:9, 8's:9.\n\nThree-digit pages: units place 4's:39, 8's:39.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because 39 + 9 +1 = 49 for 4's in units place, which matches the all-pages approach. Similarly, 39 +9 +1=49 for 8's.\n\nSo, in the initial breakdown, the three-digit pages contribute 39 units place 4's, but that's only from 100-488. So, when adding one-digit and two-digit, we get the total of 49 for units place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, so in the initial approach, when I broke it down, for three-digit pages, units place 4's were 39, but that's only from 100-488. So, when considering all pages, we have to add the one-digit and two-digit units place counts as well.\n\nWait, but in my initial approach, I think I considered three-digit pages as 100-488, so the units place 4's there are 39. But when I did the all-pages approach, I got 49, which includes the one-digit and two-digit pages. So, that makes sense.\n\nSo, perhaps in the initial approach, I was correct in the three-digit pages contributing 39 units place 4's, but when I considered all pages, I got 49, which is 39 (three-digit) + 10 (two-digit) + 1 (one-digit). Wait, no, two-digit units place 4's are 9, and one-digit is 1, so 9 +1=10, plus three-digit 39, total 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, going back, in the initial approach, I correctly calculated units place 4's as 39 in three-digit pages, but when considering all pages, it's 49. So, I think the initial approach was correct, but perhaps I confused the total counts.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I had:\n\n- Units place: 39 for 4's and 39 for 8's in three-digit pages.\n\nBut that's only for 100-488. So, to get the total, I have to add the one-digit and two-digit units place counts.\n\nSo, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 1 (one-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nIn one-digit pages, there is no tens place, so 0.\n\nIn two-digit pages, tens place:\n\n4's: 10 times (40-49).\n\n8's:10 times (80-89).\n\nIn three-digit pages, tens place:\n\n4's: 10 (140-149) +10 (240-249) +10 (340-349) +10 (440-449) = 40.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages. So, 40 times.\n\n8's: 10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, tens place:\n\n4's: 10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit) =50.\n\n8's:10 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit)=49.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the initial approach, I had:\n\nIn three-digit pages, tens place:\n\n4's:10 (per hundred) *3 +10 (440-449) =40.\n\n8's:10*3 +9=39.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's:40 (three-digit) +10 (two-digit)=50.\n\n8's:39 (three-digit) +10 (two-digit)=49.\n\nSo, units place:49 each.\n\nTens place:50 for 4's, 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly in three-digit pages.\n\n4's: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n4's:89.\n\n8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that's different from the initial approach where I thought 4's were 168 and 8's 78, difference 90. Wait, no, 188-98=90. So, same difference.\n\nWait, so in the initial approach, I had:\n\n4's:39 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=168.\n\n8's:39 (units) +39 (tens) +0=78.\n\nDifference:168-78=90.\n\nBut in the second approach, considering all pages, I have 4's=188, 8's=98, difference=90.\n\nSo, both approaches give the same difference, but the counts are different because in the first approach, I was only considering three-digit pages, whereas in the second approach, I considered all pages.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the book has 488 pages, so pages are from 1 to 488. So, I think the correct approach is to consider all pages, not just three-digit pages. So, in that case, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, I considered one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages separately. So, for one-digit pages:\n\n- 4's:1 (page 4)\n- 8's:1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n\n- Units place:9 each\n- Tens place:10 each\nTotal 4's:9+10=19\nTotal 8's:9+10=19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n\n- Units place:39 each\n- Tens place:40 for 4's, 39 for 8's\n- Hundreds place:89 for 4's, 0 for 8's\nTotal 4's:39+40+89=168\nTotal 8's:39+39+0=78\n\nSo, total across all pages:\n\n4's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)=188.\n\n8's:1 +19 +78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's consistent with the second approach.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just double-check the hundreds place count. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd in the tens place, for three-digit pages, 4's:10 per hundred for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 for 400-449, but wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:10 per hundred for 100-199, etc., but in 400-488, only 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the parts, and the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Categorize Page Numbers:**\n   - Pages 1\u20139: One-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 10\u201399: Two-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 100\u2013488: Three-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in Each Category:**\n\n   - **One-Digit Pages (1\u20139):**\n     - 4 appears once (page 4).\n     - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n   - **Two-Digit Pages (10\u201399):**\n     - **Units Place:**\n       - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n       - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n     - **Tens Place:**\n       - 4 appears 10 times (40\u201349).\n       - 8 appears 10 times (80\u201389).\n     - **Total in Two-Digit Pages:**\n       - 4's: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19.\n       - 8's: 9 + 10 = 19.\n\n   - **Three-Digit Pages (100\u2013488):**\n     - **Units Place:**\n       - Each hundred (100\u2013199, 200\u2013299, 300\u2013399) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n       - 400\u2013488 contributes 9 4's and 9 8's.\n       - Total: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39 for both 4's and 8's.\n     - **Tens Place:**\n       - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n       - 400\u2013488: 10 4's (440\u2013449) and 9 8's (480\u2013488).\n       - Total: 3\u00d710 + 10 = 40 for 4's; 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39 for 8's.\n     - **Hundreds Place:**\n       - 4 appears 89 times (400\u2013488).\n       - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1\u2013488.\n\n3. **Summing Up Across All Pages:**\n   - **4's:**\n     - One-digit: 1.\n     - Two-digit: 19.\n     - Three-digit: 39 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 168.\n     - Total: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n   - **8's:**\n     - One-digit: 1.\n     - Two-digit: 19.\n     - Three-digit: 39 (units) + 39 (tens) = 78.\n     - Total: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's. That should give me the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, as does the digit 8. \n\nBut wait, I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, that's the same, so the difference here is zero.\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit in the tens place is the same for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1; from 20-29, it's 2, and so on.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears in the range 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for 4 and 4*10=40 times for 8.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see:\n\n- Tens digit 4: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page. So from 401-488, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, tens digit 8 is in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). \n\nWait, no, let me correct that. The tens digit 8 in the 400s would be from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So in the partial hundred:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (440-449)\n- Tens digit 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo total for tens place:\n\n4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\nSo the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, the hundreds digit. This is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So for 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 100, so after 400-499, the next would be 500-599, but our book ends at 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So 8's in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**4. Total Difference:**\n\nNow, adding up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +1\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I count correctly in each place?\n\nIn units place, both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times, so no difference there. That seems right.\n\nIn tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's, so a difference of +1. That also seems correct because in the last partial hundred, 4's had 10 and 8's had 9.\n\nIn hundreds place, 4's had 89 and 8's had 0, so that's a big difference of +89.\n\nAdding them up gives 90, so 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, correct. So 89 times. And 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, which is less than 500. So 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So yeah, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place.\n   - Total units digits: 488.\n   - Number of times 4 appears: 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full cycles + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - Similarly, 8 appears 49 times.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400), each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total for 4: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total for 8: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8. After that, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place for each block of 10.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each of those 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, looking at the last 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (page 484), and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 100 pages. For example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100 pages, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages (like 40-49). Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages (80-89). \n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks and then 88 pages left. In each of those 4 blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages and 8 for 10 pages. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages. So that's 10 times. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. From 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 times each, the total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 1000 pages, but since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, page numbers start at 1, so pages 1-99 are one or two-digit numbers, and pages 100-488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, meaning 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be where 8 appears in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 full blocks of 10: 48 times each\n- Last 8 pages: 484 (1 time) and 488 (1 time)\nTotal 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4 blocks of 100: 4 * 10 = 40 each\n- Remaining 88 pages:\n  - 440-449: 10 times for 4\n  - 480-488: 9 times for 8\nTotal 4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 times for 4\n- 800-...: 0 times for 8\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. Now, looking at the extra 8 pages (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. How many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nSo, in each of these 4 hundreds, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. That's 4 x 10 = 40 times each. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 9 for each ten pages. So, in the 401-488 range, how many times does the tens digit 4 and 8 appear? \n\nFrom 401-410, the tens digit is 0. 411-420, it's 1, and so on. Wait, actually, 401-410 is tens digit 0, 411-420 is 1, 421-430 is 2, 431-440 is 3, 441-450 is 4, 451-460 is 5, 461-470 is 6, 471-480 is 7, and 481-490 would be 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488. \n\nWait, so in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, the tens digit 8 would be from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages (481-488), so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place here. \n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but in 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 pages. So, for the tens digit, in the 401-488 range, digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nSo, adding that to the earlier 40 times from the four hundreds, the total for the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 times for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have the hundreds digit as 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit would be 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. The hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399 and 400-488. So, yes, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in this book. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8: 48 each.\n- Pages 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 for 4 and 8: 40 each.\n- Pages 401-488: tens digit 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times), and tens digit 8 appears in 481-488 (8 times).\n- So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets and 8 extra pages.\n- 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place.\n- In the extra 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- **Total:** 49 times each.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n- Pages 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (441-450), 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- **Total:** 50 times for 4, 48 times for 8.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, appearing 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- **Total:** 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by figuring out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488. Then I'll do the same for the digit 8 and subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nLet's tackle the digit 4 first. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. Each set contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Yes, 484 is within that range. So that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). How many full hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 times, so that's 4\u00d710=40 times. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, 40+10=50 times in the tens place.\n\nNext, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Again, every set of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. As before, there are 48 full sets and one partial set. Each full set gives one 8, so 48. The last partial set (481-488) includes 488, so that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place: In each set of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are four full hundreds, contributing 4\u00d710=40 times. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, no, in the tens place, each occurrence is a full ten. So, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. But in terms of the tens digit, each of those 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 times. So total tens place 8's are 40+9=49 times.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49+49=98 times.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** Occurs once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** Occurs 10 times every 100 numbers, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** Occurs from 400 to 488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Occurs once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** Occurs 10 times every 100 numbers, with an additional 9 times in the last partial set, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** Does not occur as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, so the book has pages from 1 to 488. That means page numbers range from 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference between the two counts.\n\nStarting with the 1-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once, right? So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. The difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to the 2-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in 2-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49. That's 10 times (40, 41, ..., 49).\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89. That's also 10 times (80, 81, ..., 89).\n\nFor the units place in 2-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, so from 10-99, that's 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, but 44 has two 4's, so actually, in the units place, it's 9 times, but 44 contributes an extra 4 in the tens place, which we've already counted. So, for units place, 4 appears 9 times.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every ten numbers, so that's 9 times (18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98). But 88 has two 8's, so in the units place, it's 9 times, with the extra 8 in the tens place already counted.\n\nWait, no, actually, when considering units place, each occurrence is just once per ten numbers, regardless of the tens digit. So from 10-99, for units digit 4, it's 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Similarly, for 8, it's 9 times (18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98). So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nBut wait, 44 and 88 are both two-digit numbers where the digit appears twice. So, in the tens place, we've already counted the 4 and 8, and in the units place, we're counting them again. So, for each of these numbers, the digit appears twice, but in separate places.\n\nSo, putting it together for 2-digit numbers:\n- 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and 9 times in the units place (14,24,...,94), totaling 19 times.\n- 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89) and 9 times in the units place (18,28,...,98), totaling 19 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 40-49 is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place, and 14,24,...,94 are 9 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the units place. So, 10 + 9 = 19 for 4. Similarly, 10 + 9 = 19 for 8. So, in 2-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. Hmm, but that seems high. Let me check.\n\nWait, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. For the tens place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 10 times, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 9 times (since the tens digit ranges from 1 to 9). So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well. So, 10 + 9 = 19 for both 4 and 8 in 2-digit numbers. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to 3-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. I think I need to consider each place separately again.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488.\n- For 4 in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- For 8 in the hundreds place: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in 3-digit numbers:\n- For 4 in the tens place: We need to consider numbers where the tens digit is 4. These would be from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. But wait, since the book goes up to 488, the last set is 440-449, which is within 488. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 4 ranges \u00d7 10 = 40 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included, right? So, 4 times 10 is 40. So, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\n- For 8 in the tens place: Similarly, numbers where the tens digit is 8. These would be 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. So, let's count each:\n\n180-189: 10 numbers\n280-289: 10 numbers\n380-389: 10 numbers\n480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo total for 8 in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 180-189 is 10 numbers, same for 280-289 and 380-389. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, the units place in 3-digit numbers:\n- For 4 in the units place: We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit across all 3-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n100-199: The units digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, the units digit 4 appears 10 times (104,114,...,194). Similarly, in 200-299, it's 204,214,...,294: 10 times. Same for 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times. Now, 400-488: The units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo total for 4 in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\n- For 8 in the units place: Similarly, count how many times 8 appears in the units digit.\n\n100-199: 108,118,...,198: 10 times.\n200-299: 208,218,...,298: 10 times.\n300-399: 308,318,...,398: 10 times.\n400-488: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included, so from 408 to 488, stepping by 10, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total for 8 in the units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 for units digit 8: starting at 408, then 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each.\n\nWait, but let me add up the counts for 4 and 8 in 3-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4:\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because pages 400-488 are 89 pages. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 4 times 10 is 40. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred (100-199, etc.) except the last one, which is 9 times. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place: 0 times, correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, 8 appears 10 times in each hundred except the last, which is 9 times. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, total for 4 in 3-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal for 8 in 3-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts from 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit numbers.\n\n1-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\n2-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\n3-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts because the difference seems quite large.\n\nWait, in the 3-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times and 8 appears 78 times. That's a big difference, but considering that 4 is in the hundreds place 89 times, which 8 doesn't have, it makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me check the 3-digit counts again.\n\nHundreds place for 4: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each is 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 39. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTens place for 8: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8: same as 4, 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 4: 89+40+39=168.\n\n8: 0+39+39=78.\n\nAdding the 1-digit and 2-digit:\n\n4: 1+19=20. 20+168=188.\n\n8: 1+19=20. 20+78=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **1-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - **4 appears once.**\n   - **8 appears once.**\n   - **Count so far:** 4:1, 8:1.\n\n2. **2-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98).\n   - **Total for 2-digit:**\n     - 4:10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n     - 8:10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n   - **Count so far:** 4:1+19=20, 8:1+19=20.\n\n3. **3-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times (104,114,...,484).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (108,118,...,488).\n   - **Total for 3-digit:**\n     - 4:89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n     - 8:0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Count so far:** 4:20+168=188, 8:20+78=98.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4:** 188 times.\n   - **8:** 98 times.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll start by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for example, in pages 1-10, 4 appears on page 4 and 8 appears on page 8. \n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 pages. In each of the 48 complete groups, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. \n\nBut wait, in the partial group, which is pages 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this group, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding that to the previous count, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages. So, for example, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, then 10-19 it's 1, and so on. So, each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 consecutive pages. \n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, in the range 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. Similarly, for 8, it's in the range 80-89. So, each of these digits appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to page 488. So, for the 8's in the tens place, the range is 80-89, which is within 488, so that's 10 pages. For 4's, the range is 40-49, which is also within 488, so that's another 10 pages. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 1-100, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Then from 101-200, same thing, and so on. So, up to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place? Wait, no, that can't be right because each hundred only has one set of 0-9 in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, each hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4 and 10 pages where it's 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for 4 and 40 for 8? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 488 is less than 500. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me approach it differently. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each 100-page block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49) and 8 for 10 pages (80-89). So, in each 100 pages, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks and a partial block of 88 pages. \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per block, so 4*10=40 times. \n\nNow, in the partial block, which is pages 401-488, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. \n\nLooking at the tens digit in this range: from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, it's 2; 430-439, it's 3; 440-449, it's 4; 450-459, it's 5; 460-469, it's 6; 470-479, it's 7; 480-488, it's 8. \n\nSo, in the partial block, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block. \n\nWait, so in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). \n\nSo, adding up, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4 blocks * 10 + 10 = 50 times. \n\nAnd the total number of 8's in the tens place is 4 blocks * 10 + 9 = 49 times. \n\nWait, that seems right. Because in the partial block, the 8's in the tens place only go up to 488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, 9 times instead of 10. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the next hundred would be 500-599, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's total up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places. \n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 for 4 and 8, and the last group (481-488) has one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. Then in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 4: 4*10 +10=50, 8:4*10 +9=49. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) include one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each 100-page block.\n   - There are 4 complete 100-page blocks, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - The partial block (401-488) includes 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits each page number has. Page numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, so that's 9 pages. From 10 to 99, each page number is two digits, so that's 90 pages. Then from 100 to 488, each page number is three digits, which would be 488 - 99 = 389 pages. Wait, but actually, 488 - 100 + 1 = 389, right? Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each complete set of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does 8. But since the book doesn't end exactly at a multiple of ten, I need to check the last set.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 pages. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48 complete sets, with 8 pages remaining (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, except for the last partial set. But wait, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each set of ten. So, for 48 complete sets, 4 appears 48 times in the units place, and 8 appears 48 times as well. Then, in the last 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, total units digit 4's: 48 +1=49, and units digit 8's: 48+1=49. So, in the units place, they are equal. So, no difference there.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see.\n\nFrom 0-99: 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nNow, from 100-199: The tens digit cycles again. So, 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 180-189, also 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: 4 appears in 240-249 (10 times), and 8 appears in 280-289 (10 times).\n\nFrom 300-399: 4 appears in 340-349 (10 times), and 8 appears in 380-389 (10 times).\n\nNow, from 400-488: The tens digit here would be 0-8, but let's see. From 400-409: tens digit is 0. 410-419: tens digit is 1. 420-429: tens digit is 2. 430-439: tens digit is 3. 440-449: tens digit is 4. 450-459: tens digit is 5. 460-469: tens digit is 6. 470-479: tens digit is 7. 480-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's only in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in this last block, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's count all the tens digits:\n\nFrom 0-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 100-199: 10 times each.\n\nFrom 200-299: 10 times each.\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 times each.\n\nFrom 400-488: 10 times for 4, 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total tens digits:\n\n4's: 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 in 400-488, so total 50.\n\n8's: same as above, 4 blocks each contributing 10, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. So, 4's are more by 1.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each of these 100-page blocks contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40 each. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40+10=50, 8's: 40+9=49. So, yes, 50 vs 49, so 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, 8's are 0. So, 4's are more by 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nUnits place: 4's=49, 8's=49. Difference: 0.\n\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=49. Difference: +1.\n\nHundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nWait, so 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: Each set of 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units digit. There are 48 complete sets (480 pages), so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8 in the tens place. So, 40 each. Then, from 400-488: 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 for 4. For 8, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 for 8. So, total 50 for 4, 49 for 8. So, 4's are more by 1.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. So, 89 more for 4.\n\nAdding up: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine the Range of Page Numbers:**\n   - Pages 1-9: 1-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 10-99: 2-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 100-488: 3-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Count Occurrences in Each Digit Position:**\n   \n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n     - 48 occurrences each for 4 and 8 in units place.\n     - Last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more for both 4 and 8.\n     - Total units: 49 each.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages.\n     - From 0-399: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 each for 4 and 8.\n     - Pages 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - Total tens: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 400-488: 4 appears 89 times.\n     - 8 does not appear in hundreds place.\n     - Total hundreds: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Differences:**\n   - Units: 49 - 49 = 0.\n   - Tens: 50 - 49 = +1.\n   - Hundreds: 89 - 0 = +89.\n   - Total difference: 0 +1 +89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means we'll be dealing with one-digit numbers (1-9), two-digit numbers (10-99), and three-digit numbers (100-488). \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the whole number part, which is 48 groups. That gives us 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Let me check: the last page is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last group. Since 8 is less than 9, the 48th group ends at 480, and then we have pages 481 to 488. In the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is indeed 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so we have 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. Each complete block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks give us 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, in each group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages, so that's 48 occurrences. Now, checking the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once here. Therefore, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. Wait, let's check: the tens digit is 8 when the number is between 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 pages, 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 times).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 per 100 pages, 488/100 = 4.88, so 4 full blocks contributing 40, plus 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 in complete groups, plus 1 in 481-488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 in complete blocks, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has pages from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 through 99 are two-digit, and 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all these page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, let's consider each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, I need to figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are and if there's a partial block at the end.\n\nTotal pages: 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages (since 488 - 48*10 = 8). In each complete block, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at page 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, each number has 4 in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nEach hundred has one such block (40-49), so in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's five blocks where the tens digit is 4, but actually, the first block is 1-100, which includes 40-49. Then 101-200 includes 140-149, 201-300 includes 240-249, 301-400 includes 340-349, and 401-488 includes 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 401-488, which includes 440-449, so that's a full 10 numbers. So yes, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 1-100: 40-49 is 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149 is another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. 401-488: 440-449, another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the partial block of 8 pages (481-488). In the units place, the last number is 488, so 8 appears at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 = 8, so 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many such blocks?\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189 is 10. 201-300: 280-289 is 10. 301-400: 380-389 is 10. 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 4 full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, the tens place was 50. Hmm, but here, for 8's, it's 49. Let me make sure.\n\nYes, because the last block for 8's in the tens place is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, so 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the units place for 8's. From 1-488, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place, so 48 blocks give 48, and the last partial block (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's 49. So, yes, 49 units place 8's.\n\nTens place: 49 as calculated.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Because in the hundreds place, 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 9 occurrences in the tens place for 8's in the last block. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again. For the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, total 188.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, yes, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? From 1 to 488, how many numbers ending with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. The last term is 484, so 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 numbers ending with 4, so 49 occurrences.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 8,18,28,...,488. So, starting at 8, each 10 numbers, up to 488. Let's see, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 numbers ending with 8, so 49 occurrences.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So, 5 blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, so 49 in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, let me check: 400 is included, so 400 is the first, then 401, 402,... up to 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once.  \n   - There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).  \n   - Total units place 4's: 48 (complete blocks) + 1 (partial block) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).  \n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Total tens place 4's: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - From 400 to 488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers.  \n   - Total units place 8's: 48 (complete blocks) + 1 (partial block) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - In every block of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).  \n   - There are 4 complete blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial block (480-488).  \n   - Total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No page numbers in 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then it repeats. So in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 additional pages. In each complete block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in these, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). \n\nSo, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 +1 = 49 times for 8. So so far, both digits have appeared 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each cycle of 100 has 10 instances where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49) and 10 instances where the tens digit is 8 (like 80-89). \n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So there are 4 complete hundreds, and then 88 pages left. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages and 8 for 10 pages. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the hundreds place. Wait, no, the hundreds place is fixed at 4 for pages 401-499, but we're only going up to 488. So the tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. \n\nLet me think: from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred, but since we're only going up to 88, it's a bit different. Wait, actually, from 401 to 499, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each set of ten pages. But since we're stopping at 488, the tens digits go up to 8 in the tens place. \n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 401 to 488. \n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? Each tens digit appears 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times because we're stopping at 488. Wait, no, actually, from 401 to 488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except the last one, which is 8, but let's check:\n\nWait, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages.\n\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages.\n\n421-430: tens digit 2, 10 pages.\n\n431-440: tens digit 3, 10 pages.\n\n441-450: tens digit 4, 10 pages.\n\n451-460: tens digit 5, 10 pages.\n\n461-470: tens digit 6, 10 pages.\n\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 pages.\n\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages.\n\nSo, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nSo in the tens place from 401 to 488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\nFor 4: 4*10 (from the hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times.\n\nFor 8: 4*10 (from the hundreds) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the 4 in the tens place in the hundreds is 4*10, which is 40, plus the 10 from 441-450, making 50. For 8, it's 4*10=40 plus the 8 from 481-488, making 48.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 50 times for 4, 48 times for 8.\n\nSo, so far, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) = 99.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) = 97.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding to our totals:\n\nTotal 4's: 99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: 97 +0=97.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nBut 8 in the hundreds place would start at 800, which is beyond 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo yes, 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89)= 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. From 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So in each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488).\n\nWait, but earlier I considered from 401-488, which is 88 pages, and in that range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 appears 4*10=40 times, 8 appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nFrom 401-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo total tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+8=48.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1 4 and 1 8) and then 8 extra pages where 4 and 8 each appear once. So units:49 each.\n\nHundreds place:4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the frequency of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds), we find that 4 appears 188 times while 8 appears 97 times. Thus, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the different places where the digits 4 and 8 can appear: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. I'll need to calculate how many times each digit appears in each of these positions and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I need to check those extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488). In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 8 appears once more in the units place. That means the total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49, while the 4's remain at 48. So, in the units place, 8 appears once more than 4.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 100 pages. For example, from 1-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 pages. But wait, actually, it's every 10 pages. So, in each block of 100 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Hmm, maybe I should think of it differently. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten pages. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut let me see: from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each 100 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 times 100, so each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. But wait, 488 is more than 400, so I need to check the remaining 88 pages.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all pages. Let me think again. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 times each digit appears in the tens place. But from 401 to 488, that's 88 pages. So, the tens digits here go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-488). Wait, no, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, and so on up to 481-490: tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 481-488, which is 8 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, from 401 to 488, how many times does each digit appear? Let's see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0 (10 pages), 411-420: 1 (10 pages), ..., 481-490: 8 (10 pages), but since we stop at 488, that's only 8 pages for the tens digit 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 times for each hundred, but in the last partial hundred (401-488), it appears 8 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, each hundred block from 1-100, 101-200, etc., each has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, so each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear? \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n- 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 pages\n- 1: 411-420 \u2192 10 pages\n- 2: 421-430 \u2192 10 pages\n- 3: 431-440 \u2192 10 pages\n- 4: 441-450 \u2192 10 pages\n- 5: 451-460 \u2192 10 pages\n- 6: 461-470 \u2192 10 pages\n- 7: 471-480 \u2192 10 pages\n- 8: 481-488 \u2192 8 pages\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 8 appears 8 times, and all other digits from 0-7 appear 10 times each. But wait, we're considering the entire range from 1-488, so the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place is:\n\nFor digits 0-7: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-480) = 50 times each.\n\nFor digit 8: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because from 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear?\n\nAs I listed before, from 401-488:\n- 0: 10 pages\n- 1: 10 pages\n- 2: 10 pages\n- 3: 10 pages\n- 4: 10 pages\n- 5: 10 pages\n- 6: 10 pages\n- 7: 10 pages\n- 8: 8 pages\n\nSo, for each digit from 0-7, they appear 10 more times in the tens place, making it 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 times each. For digit 8, it's 40 (from 1-400) + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so the tens digits go up to 8, but only 8 pages for 8. So, the total for 8 in the tens place is 48 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times. Then, from 401-488, each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times (since each tens digit is present for 10 pages except for 8, which is only present for 8 pages). So, the total for each digit:\n\n- 0: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 1: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 2: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 3: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 5: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 6: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8 appears 48 times, and 4 appears 50 times.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears compared to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 appears 2 more times than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times. From 401-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. So, 4's total is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's total is 40 + 8 = 48. So, yes, 4 appears 2 more times than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total number of times each digit appears:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 48 (from earlier)\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 (from earlier)\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place. Earlier, I thought that in the units place, 8 appears 49 times and 4 appears 48 times because from 1-480, each digit appears 48 times (since 480/10=48), and then from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more, making it 49. But 4 doesn't appear in the units place in 481-488 because 484 would be the next one, but 488 is the last page. Wait, 484 is within 481-488, right? So, 484 would be page 484, which is within 481-488. So, in the units place from 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more in the units place (at 484), and 8 appears once more (at 488). So, that would mean in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 +1 = 49 times. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the units place properly. The total number of units digits is 488. Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then the first 8 digits (0-7) appear once more in the units place of the last 8 pages (481-488). Wait, no, the units digits from 481-488 are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once more. So, digits 1-8 each appear 48 +1 = 49 times, and digits 9 and 0 appear 48 times.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, in the units place, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times as well. Because from 1-480, each digit appears 48 times, and from 481-488, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8 appeared 49 times and 4 appeared 48 times, but that was incorrect because I didn't consider that 484 is within 481-488, so 4 also appears once more in the units place.\n\nSo, correcting that:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (484) = 49\n- 8: 48 (from 1-480) +1 (488) = 49\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving back to the tens place. Earlier, I thought that from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times. So, 4 appears 40 +10=50 times, and 8 appears 40 +8=48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n- 4: 50\n- 8: 48\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n- 4: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8: 0\n\nSo, total for 4:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nTotal for 8:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's =49 +48=97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but now it's 91. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 are 49 each.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 is 50, 8 is 48.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 is 89, 8 is 0.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, so earlier I miscalculated the units place, thinking 4 appeared 48 times, but actually, it's 49. So, the correct difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place calculation. From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. From 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0-7, they appear 10 times each (401-410, 411-420, etc.), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place from 401-488, making it 40+10=50. 8 appears 8 times, making it 40+8=48.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nWait, but let me check if 400-488 is 89 pages. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488-400=88, so 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 90, but that was before correcting the units place. So, the correct answer should be 91.\n\nWait, but let me check once more.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480, and then from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count, making them 49 each. So, 4 and 8 each appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0-8. Each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, making total 50, and 8 appears 8 times, making total 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers 4 and 8 will each appear once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 488 is actually 48 full tens plus 8, so maybe I should adjust that. Hmm, actually, the units digit cycles every 10 pages, so for 488 pages, that's 48 full tens (480 pages) and 8 extra pages. So, for the units place, the digits 0 through 8 each appear 48 times, and 9 appears 48 times as well because the extra 8 pages go up to 488, which is a 488, so the units digit for the last partial set is 8, but that doesn't add an extra 9. Wait, no, actually, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 481 has 1, 482 has 2, up to 488 which has 8. So, the units digit 8 appears once more in this partial set. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times plus 1 more in the last 8 pages, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because the units digit 8 in the last partial set is just one more, so 48 + 1 = 49 for 8, and 48 for 4.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, in total, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Hmm, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages, which are from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; 421-430, tens digit is 2; 431-440, tens digit is 3; 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; 461-470, tens digit is 6; 471-480, tens digit is 7; and 481-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each of these ranges is 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 pages (481-488). So, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times in the last partial set. Wait, no, let me check. From 401-410, tens digit is 0, that's 10 pages. 411-420, tens digit 1, 10 pages. Similarly up to 471-480, tens digit 7, 10 pages. Then 481-488, tens digit 8, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this last partial set. So, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: for digits 0-7, it's 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 = 50 times each. For digit 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48 times. And for digit 9, it's only 40 times because we don't have any 9 in the tens place beyond the full hundreds.\n\nWait, but wait, in the full hundreds, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, right? So, for 400-488, the tens digits are as I described. So, for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in the 401-410 range? Wait, no, 401-410 has tens digit 0, right? Wait, no, 401 is 4-0-1, so tens digit is 0. 411-420 is 4-1-1 to 4-2-0, so tens digit is 1. Similarly, 421-430 is tens digit 2, up to 431-440 being tens digit 3, then 441-450 is tens digit 4, 451-460 is 5, 461-470 is 6, 471-480 is 7, and 481-488 is 8. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8 pages. So, for the tens digit, in 401-488, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, adding to the 40 times from the full hundreds, the total for each digit in the tens place is:\n\n- 0: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 1: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 2: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 3: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 5: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 6: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 7: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n- 9: 40 + 0 = 40\n\nWait, but this can't be right because from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, so 9 doesn't appear at all in the tens place beyond the full hundreds. So, yes, 9 appears only 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. So, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, each page number from 1-99 has a hundreds digit of 0 (since they're one or two-digit numbers). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 0: appears for pages 1-99, which is 99 pages, but since we're considering the hundreds digit, each page from 1-99 has a hundreds digit of 0, so that's 99 times.\n- 1: 100-199, which is 100 pages, so 100 times.\n- 2: 200-299, 100 times.\n- 3: 300-399, 100 times.\n- 4: 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because this seems a bit high. Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, except for the last partial set. Since 488 is 48*10 + 8, so from 1-480, each digit appears 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 8's: 48 +1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred, 10 times each digit. So, 4 hundreds, so 40 times each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8 pages. So, 0-7 each get 10 more, and 8 gets 8 more. So, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50. 8's: 40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times (400-488)\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear at all, which seems correct because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only up to 4.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8 pages. So, for each digit from 0 to 7, they appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, yes, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that I'm missing something in the hundreds place? For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, it's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, pages 1-9: 9 pages, each with 1 digit: 9 digits.\n\nPages 10-99: 90 pages, each with 2 digits: 180 digits.\n\nPages 100-488: 488 - 99 = 389 pages, each with 3 digits: 389 *3 = 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, the total number of 4's and 8's should be a portion of these. But let me not get bogged down here; my initial calculation seems consistent.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's:50\n- 8's:48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\n8's:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think if I considered all the digits correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so 0 appears 99 times, but that's not relevant here. From 100-199, 1 appears 100 times, etc.\n\nI think I've covered all the cases. So, the final answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in the units place from 1 to 480.\n   - From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, adding one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit from 1 to 400.\n   - From 401 to 488, the tens digits cycle through 0-8, with 8 appearing 8 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 89\n   - **Total 8's:** 0\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, let's consider each position:\n\n1. **Units place:** For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from page 1 to 488, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full sets of 10 pages, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets and then 8 more pages. In those 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place beyond the 48th set. So units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. For example, pages 40-49 have 4 in the tens place. So how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, in each hundred, there's one set of 10 pages with 4 in the tens place. So for 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, there's 10 pages with 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 in pages 440-449, which is another 10 pages. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 400 is the first page with a hundreds digit of 4, and it goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So 187 fours.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages every 100 pages. For example, pages 80-89, 180-189, etc. So how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. In each hundred, there's one set of 10 pages with 8 in the tens place. So 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 8 in pages 480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but our book ends at 488. So from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 pages. For every 10 pages, one 4. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digit is 1-8, so 4 appears once more? Wait, no. Wait, 488 is the last page. So from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480), and then 481-488. So in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 pages, so 48 times in the full sets, and then in 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm thinking 49. Which is correct? Let me clarify.\n\nFrom page 1 to 480, there are 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. I had 48, but it's actually 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributes 10 fours. So in 488 pages, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place: 4 * 10 = 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Earlier I thought 48 units, but now 49. So let me recalculate.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I confused the calculation earlier. Let's do it again.\n\nUnits place for 4:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 4:\n\nIn each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., so 10 pages each. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 pages. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4:\n\nPages 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 187, but now it's 188. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the 8's again.\n\nUnits place for 8:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once more (page 488). So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place for 8:\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., so 10 pages each. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place for 8:\n\nAs before, no pages in the book have 8 in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo now, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 187 - 98 = 89, but now it's 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, seems I made a mistake in the initial calculation of 4's.\n\nWait, let me make sure. Let me recalculate the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 pages with 4 in the tens place. 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets, 48 eights, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, 40 eights, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 89. Maybe I miscalculated the units place for 4's.\n\nWait, let's check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, starting from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. So the number of such pages is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is greater than or equal to 4, we add 1 more. So 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: same calculation, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo yes, 49 each in units place.\n\nTens place for 4's: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, how many pages? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400 is page 400, which is the first page with a hundreds digit of 4, and it goes up to 488, so that's 89 pages. So yes, 89 fours.\n\nSo, I think the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 90, but I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should list out the counts again:\n\nCount of 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nCount of 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4's, it became 90.\n\nWait, let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 pages: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such pages is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, we add 1 more. So 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's: 8,18,28,...,488. The last one is 488, so same calculation: 48 +1=49.\n\nSo units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nTens place for 4's: in each hundred, 40-49, so 10 times per hundred. 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 50.\n\nTens place for 8's: in each hundred, 80-89, so 10 times per hundred. 4 hundreds give 40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: only 4's, 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times each digit appears in each place and then sum them up. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Here, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, the digit 0 appears 48 times in the units place, but we're only concerned with 4's and 8's. So, for the units place, both 4 and 8 each appear 48 times. But then we have the extra 8 pages, which are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 doesn't appear here, but 8 does. So, that adds one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. For example, pages 1-100: the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. \n\nNow, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages? We have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. \n\nSo, in 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place. Now, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? Let's see, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). Wait, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit for 8 is only from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in these 88 pages?\n\nIn the range 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n- 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- 1: 411-420 (10)\n- 2: 421-430 (10)\n- 3: 431-440 (10)\n- 4: 441-450 (10)\n- 5: 451-460 (10)\n- 6: 461-470 (10)\n- 7: 471-480 (10)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Therefore, total tens place counts:\n- 4's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from the first 400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, but hold on, in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in the last 88 pages, 441-450 adds 10 more 4's in the tens place, and 481-488 adds 8 more 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but each cycle is 10 pages. So, for each digit in the tens place, it's 10 times except for the last one, which might be less. So, from 401-488, that's 88 pages, which is 8 full tens cycles (0-7) and then 8 pages into the 8's tens place. So, for the tens digit, 0 appears 10 times (401-410), 1 appears 10 (411-420), ..., up to 7 appears 10 times (471-480), and then 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, yes, that's correct. So, 4's in the tens place: 10 times in 441-450, so total 40 +10=50. 8's: 8 times in 481-488, so 40 +8=48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- 2: 200-299, 100 times.\n- 3: 300-399, 100 times.\n- 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). Wait, 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and it goes up to 488, so that's 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nBut wait, the problem is only about digits 4 and 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4, and 8 would only start at 800, which is beyond 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, summing up the counts for each digit place:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 97. So, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units place. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So, units 4's:48, units 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 4*10=40 for each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, with each digit from 0-7 appearing 10 times, and 8 appearing 8 times. So, in tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), so 40+10=50 for 4's. 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred, so 40+8=48 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear.\n\nAdding up:\n4's:48+50+89=187\n8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n- Pages 481-488 add one more 8.\n- Total 4's: 48\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the first 400 pages.\n- Pages 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (441-450), 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear.\n- Total 4's: 89\n- Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to separate the numbers based on the number of digits they have. So, I'll consider one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers separately. Let me start by figuring out how many pages fall into each category.\n\nOne-digit page numbers are from 1 to 9, so that's 9 pages. Two-digit numbers go from 10 to 99, which is 90 pages. Three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488, but wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so let me check how many three-digit pages there are. 488 minus 100 plus 1 is 389 pages. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me recalculate that. 488 - 100 = 388, and adding 1 gives 389 three-digit pages. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and similarly for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nFirst, the units place. For each complete set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nStarting with one-digit numbers: from 1 to 9, the number 4 appears once in the units place.\n\nFor two-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. There are 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). In each set, the units digit 4 appears once. So that's 9 times. But wait, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, 9 times 1 is 9. But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me think again. For each ten's place, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, for each ten's group, the units digit 4 appears once. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 ten's groups (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), so 9 times 1 is 9. But wait, that's only 9, but actually, from 10 to 99, it's 90 numbers, so 9 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 9 times 1 is 9, plus the one from 4 in the one-digit numbers. So, total units place 4's are 10? Wait, no, because from 1 to 9, the units digit 4 is only once, and from 10 to 99, it's 9 times, so total units place 4's are 10.\n\nWait, but let me check that. For example, from 1 to 9: 4 is one number. From 10 to 19: 14 is one. From 20 to 29: 24 is one. Similarly, up to 90-99: 94 is one. So that's 9 in two-digit numbers, plus 1 in single-digit, total 10 units place 4's. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for each set of 100. Wait, no, actually, for each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, the digits 0-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 0-99, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nBut wait, in our case, the book goes up to 488, so we have 1-99, 100-488. So, for the tens place:\n\nIn 1-99: The tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nIn 100-488: The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. So, from 100-199: tens digits 0-9 each appear 10 times. Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive), so the tens digits here go from 0-8 in the tens place (since 488 is the last). Let me see.\n\nWait, 400-488: The tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). But in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, but since 488 is the end, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, so that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0-9, except when we reach 488, which is in the tens digit 8, units digits 0-8. So, for tens digit 8, there are 9 numbers: 480-488.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4 in 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8 in 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of times 4 appears in the tens place:\n\nIn 1-99: 10 times (40-49).\n\nIn 100-399: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488: 10 times (440-449).\n\nSo total tens place 4's: 10 + 30 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn 1-99: 10 times (80-89).\n\nIn 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 times, so 3*10=30.\n\nIn 400-488: 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 10 + 30 +9=49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488.\n\nThe hundreds digit can be 1,2,3, or 4.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 4, it appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 8, but wait, in our book, the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in any page number. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's:89, and 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:10\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:10+50+89=149.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:10 (from 1-99) +9 (from 400-488)=19? Wait, no, I think I need to recalculate.\n\nWait, earlier I considered units place 8's in 1-99 as 10, but let me check that.\n\nWait, in the units place, for each set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, from 1-99, there are 9 sets of ten (10-19,...,90-99), each contributing one 8 in the units place. So that's 9 times. Plus the single-digit number 8, which is one more. So total units place 8's in 1-99:10.\n\nIn 100-488, the units digit 8 appears how many times?\n\nIn each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten's group. So, for 100-199: units digit 8 appears 10 times (108,118,...,198).\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 208,218,...,298:10 times.\n\n300-399:10 times.\n\n400-488: units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488. Let me count how many. From 400-488, the numbers ending with 8 are 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, units place 8's in 100-488:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTherefore, total units place 8's:10 (from 1-99) +39=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 10, but let me confirm that. From 1-99, units digit 4 appears once in each ten's group, so 10 times (4,14,24,...,94). That's correct. So, units place 4's:10, 8's:10 in 1-99, plus 39 in 100-488, total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 10, which matches, and 8's are 49. Hmm, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, in 1-99, units digit 8 appears 10 times (8,18,28,...,98). Then in 100-488, units digit 8 appears 39 times, as calculated. So total units place 8's:10+39=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated tens place 8's as 49, so adding units place 49, that's 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. Earlier, I thought tens place 4's were 50 and 8's were 49. Let me confirm that.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n1-99:10 times (40-49).\n\n100-399:3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 3*10=30.\n\n400-488:10 times (440-449).\n\nTotal:10+30+10=50.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n1-99:10 times (80-89).\n\n100-399:3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 3*10=30.\n\n400-488:9 times (480-488).\n\nTotal:10+30+9=49.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:149, total 8's:98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 149 -98=51.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I feel like I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, total 4's:\n\nUnits:10\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:10+50+89=149.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:149-98=51.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 51 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any 4's or 8's.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try that again.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nFrom 1-9:1\n\nFrom 10-99:9 (14,24,...,94)\n\nFrom 100-488:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 units place 4's, except the last partial hundred.\n\nFrom 100-399:3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 10 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484. How many numbers is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10, so that's (484 -404)/10 +1= (80)/10 +1=8+1=9 times. So, units place 4's in 400-488:9.\n\nSo, total units place 4's:1 (1-9) +9 (10-99) +30 (100-399) +9 (400-488)=1+9+30+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 10. Hmm, now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nWait, in 1-9:1\n\n10-99:9 (14,24,...,94) \u2192 9 numbers.\n\n100-399:3 hundreds, each contributing 10 units place 4's \u21923*10=30.\n\n400-488:9 units place 4's.\n\nSo total units place 4's:1+9+30+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 10. That must have been a mistake. So, actually, units place 4's are 49.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in 1-9: page 4 is one.\n\nFrom 10-99: pages 14,24,...,94: that's 9 pages, so 9.\n\nFrom 100-399: each hundred has 10 units place 4's, so 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: units place 4's are at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo total units place 4's:1+9+30+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for units place 8's:\n\nFrom 1-9: page 8 is one.\n\nFrom 10-99: pages 18,28,...,98:9 pages.\n\nFrom 100-399: each hundred contributes 10 units place 8's, so 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: units place 8's are at 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488:9 pages.\n\nSo total units place 8's:1+9+30+9=49.\n\nWait, so both units place 4's and 8's are 49. That's different from my earlier calculation where I thought units place 4's were 10. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify: in the initial approach, I considered 1-99, and thought that units place 4's were 10, but actually, it's 10 in 1-99, because from 1-9:1, and 10-99:9, so total 10. But when I broke it down into 1-9,10-99, etc., I got 1+9=10 for 1-99. Then, in 100-399:30, and 400-488:9, so total 10+30+9=49. So, yes, units place 4's are 49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:10 in 1-99, plus 30 in 100-399, and 9 in 400-488, total 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99:10 times (40-49).\n\nFrom 100-399:3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times (e.g., 140-149,240-249, etc.), so 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nSo total tens place 4's:10+30+10=50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99:10 times (80-89).\n\nFrom 100-399:3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 3*10=30.\n\nFrom 400-488: tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's:10+30+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor 8's: no page number has 8 in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nNow, summing up all 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 149. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in adding.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place 4's:49\n\nTens place 4's:50\n\nHundreds place 4's:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 49, which is correct, tens place 50, and hundreds 89. So total 188.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 51. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, let me go back. I think the confusion comes from whether in 400-488, the units place 4's are 9 or 10. Let me re-examine that.\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, units place 4's in 400-488:9.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's in 400-488:408,418,...,488:9 numbers.\n\nSo, units place 4's total:1+9+30+9=49.\n\nTens place 4's:10+30+10=50.\n\nHundreds place 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:1+9+30+9=49.\n\nTens place 8's:10+30+9=49.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check with a different approach.\n\nAnother way is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, considering all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/10)*1 + extra in the last partial decade.\n\nFrom 1 to 480, there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\nThen, from 481 to 488, check if there's a 4 in the units place. 484 is within this range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's:\n\nSame approach: floor(488/10)*1 + extra.\n\nFrom 1 to 480:48 units place 8's.\n\nFrom 481-488:488 has 8 in units place, so one more. So total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nOkay, that matches.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nNumber of hundreds:4 (1-100,101-200,...,401-500), but since we only go up to 488, the last hundred is 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, 10 tens place 4's.\n\nSo, for hundreds 1-3 (1-100,101-200,201-300), each contributes 10, so 3*10=30.\n\nIn the fourth hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:30+10=40.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 50. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, no, because from 1-100, tens digit 4 appears in 40-49:10 numbers.\n\nFrom 101-200:140-149:10.\n\nFrom 201-300:240-249:10.\n\nFrom 301-400:340-349:10.\n\nFrom 401-488:440-449:10.\n\nSo that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I miscounted the hundreds. From 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:10. So that's 5*10=50. So, tens place 4's:50.\n\nSimilarly, tens place 8's:\n\nFrom 1-100:80-89:10.\n\nFrom 101-200:180-189:10.\n\nFrom 201-300:280-289:10.\n\nFrom 301-400:380-389:10.\n\nFrom 401-488:480-488:9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nOkay, that matches.\n\nNow, hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488:89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNumber of 8's:0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 51, but that was due to an error in counting the units place 4's. After correcting that, it's 90.\n\nWait, but let me check with a different approach. Let me calculate the total number of digits printed and see if this makes sense.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to accept that the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's printed in the page numbers is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine the number of pages in each digit category:**\n   - 1-digit: 1-9 (9 pages)\n   - 2-digit: 10-99 (90 pages)\n   - 3-digit: 100-488 (389 pages)\n\n2. **Count occurrences of digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 1-9: 1 occurrence (page 4)\n     - 10-99: 9 occurrences (14,24,...,94)\n     - 100-399: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences\n     - 400-488: 9 occurrences (404,414,...,484)\n     - Total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 49\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 1-99: 10 occurrences (40-49)\n     - 100-399: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences\n     - 400-488: 10 occurrences (440-449)\n     - Total tens place 4's: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 400-488: 89 occurrences\n     - Total hundreds place 4's: 89\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n3. **Count occurrences of digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 1-9: 1 occurrence (page 8)\n     - 10-99: 9 occurrences (18,28,...,98)\n     - 100-399: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences\n     - 400-488: 9 occurrences (408,418,...,488)\n     - Total units place 8's: 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 49\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 1-99: 10 occurrences (80-89)\n     - 100-399: 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 occurrences\n     - 400-488: 9 occurrences (480-488)\n     - Total tens place 8's: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - No occurrences (pages go up to 488)\n     - Total hundreds place 8's: 0\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n4. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should separate the problem into looking at each digit place individually: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can calculate how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place and then sum them up. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. \n\nHow many complete groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each of those 48 groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, here, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nHmm, so they're equal in the units place. \n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each (from 1-10, 11-20, etc.). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nHow many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). \n\nIn each of those 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10=40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40. \n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. Specifically, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. \n\nLooking for when the tens digit is 4: That's 440-449. So, how many numbers is that? 440 to 449 is 10 numbers, but wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit 8: That's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. \n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from the hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. \nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from the hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nSo, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49 in the tens place. \n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit cycles as follows: \n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers, but technically, page 1 is just 1, so maybe I should consider it as 001, but in reality, the hundreds digit doesn't exist here. Hmm, maybe I should adjust my approach. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the hundreds digit is non-zero only from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so 4 and 8 can't appear in the hundreds place there. \n\nSo, from page 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nSo, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. \n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. So, no 4 or 8 here. \n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2. Again, no 4 or 8. \n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3. Still no 4 or 8. \n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. \n\nSo, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. \n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. \nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0. \n\nNow, summing up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 of each digit. So 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So total 4's: 48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For 4 in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8 in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 pages. So total 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So 89 4's. 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n- Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89.\n- No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the 4's. Let's consider each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from page 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. That means 48 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. But wait, in the last partial group (pages 481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so page 484 will have a 4 in the units place. So that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 pages. Specifically, from page 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4. Each of these 10 pages contributes a 4 in the tens place. So how many such blocks are there up to page 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) where the tens digit is 4. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial block (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's another 10 pages, so adding 10 more, making it 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So total 4's are 188.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), page 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 in the tens place appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial block (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So 9 more 8's in the tens place, making it 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only for pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. Yep, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (48 full groups of 10 plus one in 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (4 full blocks of 100 plus 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (48 full groups of 10 plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (4 full blocks of 100 plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (which is page 4), and the digit 8 also appears once (page 8). So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. \n\nNext, I'll move on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit can be 4 or 8. When it's 4, the page numbers are from 40 to 49, which gives 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n- Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the page numbers are from 80 to 89, giving 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, in each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 18, 28, etc.).\n- There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit range (10-99), so the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the same for 8.\n\nAdding these up for two-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nSo, in two-digit page numbers, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times as well.\n\nNow, onto the three-digit page numbers, which range from 100 to 488. This is where things might get a bit trickier because the upper limit isn't a round number. I'll need to be careful here.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\n- For hundreds digit 1, 2, or 3: The hundreds place isn't 4 or 8, so we can ignore these for now. But wait, actually, since we're looking for digits 4 and 8, the hundreds place can contribute if it's 4 or 8. But in this case, the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, 4 is a possibility, but 8 isn't because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit doesn't go up to 8.\n\nSo, when the hundreds digit is 4, the page numbers are from 400 to 488. Let's handle this case separately.\n\nFirst, let's count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in the hundreds place:\n- Hundreds digit 4: occurs from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears here because there's no hundreds digit 8 in this range.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and we need to count how often 4 and 8 appear here across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nBut wait, the three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488, so we have hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4. For each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and each cycle has 10 numbers. \n\nFor each hundreds digit (1, 2, 3, 4), the tens digit 4 will appear 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly, the tens digit 8 will appear 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). \n\nBut wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit goes up to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, and 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). Hmm, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's consider each hundreds group separately.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488\n\nFor each of these, let's count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens and units places.\n\nStarting with hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n- Tens place: 4 appears in 140-149 (10 times), and 8 appears in 180-189 (10 times).\n- Units place: For each ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 10 tens (00-99), so 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n- So, total for hundreds digit 1:\n  - 4's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n  - 8's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n- Same logic applies. Tens place: 4 in 240-249 (10), 8 in 280-289 (10).\n- Units place: 10 each for 4 and 8.\n- Total:\n  - 4's: 10 + 10 = 20\n  - 8's: 10 + 10 = 20\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n- Again, same as above.\n- Tens place: 4 in 340-349 (10), 8 in 380-389 (10).\n- Units place: 10 each.\n- Total:\n  - 4's: 20\n  - 8's: 20\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- Here, the tens and units places need to be handled carefully because the upper limit is 488, not 499.\n\nFirst, the tens place:\n- Tens digit can be 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page.\n- So, for tens digit 4: 440-449 (10 pages)\n- For tens digit 8: 480-488 (9 pages, since 488 is the end)\n- So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each ten, units digits go from 0 to 9, except in the case of 480-488, where units go only up to 8.\n- Let's break it down by tens:\n  - For tens digits 0-3: Each ten (400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439) will have units digits 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once per ten, and there are 4 tens here (0-3), so 4*1=4 for 4's and 4*1=4 for 8's.\n  - For tens digit 4 (440-449): Units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (444) and 8 appears once (448). Wait, but 440-449 has 10 numbers, so 4 appears once in units place, and 8 appears once.\n  - For tens digit 5 (450-459): Units digits 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear once.\n  - Similarly, tens digits 6,7: same as above.\n  - For tens digit 8 (480-488): Units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n  \nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nLet me think: For hundreds digit 4, the page numbers are from 400 to 488.\n\nThe units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit, except for the last tens digit (80-88), where units go up to 8.\n\nSo, the number of times 4 appears in the units place:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7 (i.e., 400-479), each ten has a units digit 4 once, so that's 8 tens (0-7) * 1 = 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8 (480-488), units digit 4 appears once (484).\n- So total units digit 4's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7, each ten has a units digit 8 once, so 8 tens * 1 = 8.\n- For tens digit 8 (480-488), units digit 8 appears once (488).\n- So total units digit 8's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, but in the tens digit 8 case, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so units digits 0-8. So, 8 appears once (488), and 4 appears once (484). So, yes, units digits for 4 and 8 each get an extra count.\n\nSo, summarizing for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 10 (440-449)\n  - 8's: 9 (480-488)\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 9\n  - 8's: 9\n- So total for hundreds digit 4:\n  - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n  - 8's: 9 + 9 = 18\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the units place, I think I might have made a mistake. Let's see:\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, the units digit 4 appears:\n\n- In 400-409: 404\n- 410-419: 414\n- 420-429: 424\n- 430-439: 434\n- 440-449: 444\n- 450-459: 454\n- 460-469: 464\n- 470-479: 474\n- 480-488: 484\nSo that's 9 times, right? From 404 up to 484, every 10 pages, but in the last ten (480-488), it's only 484.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears:\n\n- 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488\nThat's 9 times as well.\n\nSo yes, units digit 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n\nBut wait, in the tens digit 8 case, 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, but 484 is also included. So, yes, units digits 4 and 8 each appear once in that last partial ten.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens place: 4's = 10, 8's = 9\n- Units place: 4's = 9, 8's = 9\n- Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n- Total 8's: 9 + 9 = 18\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the hundreds digit 4, the hundreds place contributes 89 times for 4, but that's actually the hundreds digit itself, not the tens or units. So, I need to include that as well.\n\nWait, no, the hundreds digit 4 is separate from the tens and units. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive), which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of those 89 page numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, contributing 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nSo, putting it all together for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8\n- Tens place: 19 times for 4, 18 times for 8\n- Units place: 9 times for 4, 9 times for 8\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. I think I need to separate the hundreds digit contributions from the tens and units.\n\nWait, let's reorganize:\n\nFor three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digit:\n  - 4: 89 times\n  - 8: 0 times\n- Tens digit:\n  - 4: 10 (from 440-449) + 10 (from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) * 3 hundreds digits (1,2,3) = 10 + 3*10 = 40? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. Instead of separating hundreds, tens, and units, let's calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in all three-digit page numbers.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to calculate for each digit position (hundreds, tens, units) separately across all page numbers.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last digit if the total number isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (480 pages) plus 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nIn each group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nIn the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9 and 0 don't appear.\n\nSo, total units digit counts:\n\n- For digits 0-8: 48 times each from the complete groups, plus 1 more for digits 1-8 in the last partial group.\n- Digit 9: 48 times only.\n\nBut wait, let's calculate specifically for 4 and 8.\n\nUnits digit 4: appears 48 times in the complete groups, plus 1 more in the last partial group (484), so total 49.\n\nUnits digit 8: appears 48 times in the complete groups, plus 1 more in the last partial group (488), so total 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 are pages 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digit 4 appears once (484), and digit 8 appears once (488). So, yes, units digits 4 and 8 each get an extra count.\n\nSo, units place:\n- 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nSimilarly, each digit 0-9 appears in the tens place for each group of 100. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (for 100-109: tens digit 0, 110-119: tens digit 1, etc.). So, in each hundred, each tens digit appears 10 times. \n\nBut since we're going up to 488, let's break it down:\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n\nWait, no, 400-488 is only 89 pages, not a full hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each tens digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. So, for each of these three hundreds, 10 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digits 0-8 each appear how many times?\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages. The tens digits cycle as follows:\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 420-429: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 430-439: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 460-469: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 470-479: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 pages)\n\nSo, tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- In the first three hundreds (100-399), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30 times for each digit.\n- In the last partial hundred (400-488), tens digits:\n  - 0-7: 10 each\n  - 8: 9\n  - 9: 0 (since we don't reach 490-499)\n  \nSo, total tens digit counts:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40\n- For digit 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n- For digit 9: 30 + 0 = 30\n\nSo, specifically for 4 and 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 times\n- 8's: 39 times\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nEach page number from 1-99 is a one or two-digit number, so the hundreds digit is 0 (or non-existent). From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299: 2; 300-399: 3; 400-488: 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit:\n\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488)\n- 0: for pages 1-99, but since we're only considering the hundreds digit when it's non-zero, we can ignore 0 here.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n- 8's: 0 times (since we don't have page numbers 800-899)\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 39 = 88\n\nSo, total 4's: 178\nTotal 8's: 88\n\nDifference: 178 - 88 = 90\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I calculated 49 for both 4 and 8, but let's confirm:\n\nTotal page numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480). Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nThen, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor the first three hundreds (100-399), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30 for each digit.\n\nIn 400-488, tens digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 10 (from 400-449) = 40\n\nWait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so total for 4 in tens place: 30 +10=40\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: 30 (from first three hundreds) +9 (from 480-488)=39\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n\n8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=178\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +39 (tens)+0=88\n\nDifference:178-88=90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me just think again: is there a possibility I overcounted somewhere?\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 pages. So, each of those pages has a hundreds digit of 4, contributing 89 counts.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4, we have 40 counts, which includes 30 from the first three hundreds and 10 from 440-449.\n\nIn the units place, 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but when I add up 4's: 49+40+89=178\n\nAnd 8's:49+39=88\n\nYes, 178-88=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nLet me start by understanding the range of page numbers. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). I guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4) and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, so far, 4's count is 1 and 8's count is 1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, let's look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89. That's another 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (pages 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, but page 44 was already counted in the tens place, but I think when counting digits, we count each occurrence separately, so 44 would have two 4's. But in this case, since we're counting units place, it's just once per 10 pages, so 9 times total.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (pages 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98). Again, page 88 has two 8's, but we're only counting the units place here, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, for two-digit numbers, the units place from 10 to 99 includes 90 numbers, so for each digit, it's 9 times for units place, right? Because from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, etc.), each contributing one occurrence of the digit in the units place. So 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times, and the digit 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So the difference so far is still 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break this down by each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8.\n\nBut wait, for 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so we need to check if 480-488 is included. Let me think: 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since the book ends at 488, it's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the hundreds place, for 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, so 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449) and 8 appears once (480-488, but only 9 pages). Wait, but let me clarify.\n\nActually, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149 (10 times), same for 8 in 180-189 (10 times). Similarly, in 200-299, 240-249 (10 times) and 280-289 (10 times). Same for 300-399: 340-349 and 380-389, each 10 times.\n\nNow, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 pages. The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for each hundred except the last one, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. The last hundred (400-488) has 4 appearing 10 times and 8 appearing 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n- Hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times for 4 and 30 times for 8.\n- 400-488: 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n- So total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 times for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 times for 8.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each hundred except the last, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times for 4. Similarly, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 times for 8. Then, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So total tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers:\n- Similarly, for each hundred, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, and same for 8.\n\nSo, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred (since each hundred has 100 pages, so 10 occurrences of each digit in the units place). Wait, but for 400-488, it's only 89 pages, so does that affect the count?\n\nWait, no, because the units digit cycles every 10 pages, regardless of the total number of pages. So, in 100-199, units digit 4 appears 10 times (104,114,...,194). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times (108,118,...,198). Same for 200-299, 300-399.\n\nBut for 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear? Let's see: from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, 400-409: 404 is one, 410-419: 414, etc. How many complete decades are there? 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 pages. Each full decade has one 4 in the units place, so 8 times. Plus, in 480-488, does 484 fall within this range? Yes, 484 is page 484, which is within 480-488. So that's one more, making it 9 times for 4 in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place in 400-488: each full decade has one 8, so 8 times, plus in 480-488, 488 is included, so that's one more, making it 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-488 is 89 pages, which is 8 full decades (8\u00d710=80 pages) plus 9 pages (480-488). So, in the units place, for each full decade, 4 appears once, so 8 times. In the remaining 9 pages (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is one more, so total 9 times for 4. Similarly, for 8, each full decade has one 8, so 8 times, and in 480-488, 488 is included, so that's one more, making it 9 times.\n\nSo, for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 times for 4, and same for 8.\n- 400-488: 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n- So total for units place: 30 + 9 = 39 times for 4, and 30 + 9 = 39 times for 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the units place, but 400-488 only contributes 9 times because it's 89 pages. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nWait, actually, for each hundred, whether it's 100 pages or not, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has exactly 100 pages, so each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the units place. For 400-488, which is 89 pages, the units digit cycles 0-9 eight full times (80 pages) and then 9 more pages (480-488). In those 9 pages, the units digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 8 (from the full decades) + 1 = 9 times, and 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total units place counts:\n- 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n- 8: same as above, 39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 contributes 9 times for both, so 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8: 0 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 40 times\n- 8: 39 times\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 39 times\n- 8: 39 times\n\nSo total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place for 4 is 89, tens place for 4 is 40, units place for 4 is 39. So 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8, hundreds place is 0, tens place is 39, units place is 39. So 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all page numbers:\n\nOne-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I might have made a mistake in counting the tens and units places.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So total tens place for 4 is 30 + 10 = 40. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30, plus in 400-488, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So total tens place for 8 is 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for units place in three-digit numbers: each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 each. Then, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times, as previously determined. So units place for 4 is 30 + 9 = 39, and same for 8.\n\nSo, three-digit numbers:\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8: 0 + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n- 4: 1 + 19 = 20\n- 8: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nTotal:\n- 4: 20 + 168 = 188\n- 8: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Let me think: in page numbers, each digit is counted separately, whether it's in the tens or units place, or hundreds place. So, for example, page 44 has two 4's, both counted in their respective places.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4 only appears in 400-488, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed.\n\nFrom 1 to 9: 9 pages, each with 1 digit: 9 digits.\n\nFrom 10 to 99: 90 pages, each with 2 digits: 180 digits.\n\nFrom 100 to 488: 389 pages, each with 3 digits: 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So 188 + 98 = 286 digits. That leaves 1356 - 286 = 1070 digits for other numbers, which seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nWait, another approach: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nFor units place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\nWell, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial decade (481-488), 484 is included, so that's one more. So total 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial decade, 488 is included, so one more, total 49 times.\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier count where units place for 4 was 39 and for 8 was 39. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use this method to cross-verify.\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\nFor units place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many 4's? As above, 48 full decades (1-480) with one 4 each, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is present, so one more. Total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 full decades, each with one 8, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 is present, so one more. Total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I broke it down by page number lengths, I had for units place:\n\n- One-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 9 (pages 14,24,...,94)\n- Three-digit: 39 (as calculated earlier)\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49. That matches. So, 49 times for 4 in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:\n\n- One-digit: 1 (page 8)\n- Two-digit: 9 (pages 18,28,...,98)\n- Three-digit: 39 (as calculated earlier)\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49. That also matches.\n\nOkay, so units place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, in three-digit numbers, I had 39 for units place. So, that plus one-digit and two-digit gives 49, which is correct.\n\nNow, for tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is not a complete hundred.\n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nSo total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nIn each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, 9 times.\n\nThus, total 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n- 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 + 89 = 178\n- 8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 + 0 = 88\n\nWait, but earlier, when I broke it down by page lengths, I had 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's. Now, using this digit-by-digit approach, I have 178 for 4's and 88 for 8's. There's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's check where the mistake is.\n\nIn the page length breakdown, I had:\n\nOne-digit:\n- 4:1, 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4:19, 8:19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4:168, 8:78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nBut using the digit place approach, I have:\n\nUnits: 49 each\nTens: 4's=40, 8's=39\nHundreds: 4's=89, 8's=0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88\n\nThere's a difference here. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps in the page length approach, I double-counted something. Let me check.\n\nIn the page length approach for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488)\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times (10 each from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 for 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\n- Units place: 39 times (10 each from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78\n\nThen, adding one-digit and two-digit:\n\n- 4's: 1 + 19 = 20\n- 8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nTotal: 20 + 168 = 188 for 4's, 20 + 78 = 98 for 8's.\n\nBut in the digit place approach, I get 4's=178, 8's=88.\n\nWait, perhaps the discrepancy comes from the fact that in the digit place approach, I considered all page numbers, including one-digit and two-digit, while in the page length approach, I considered them separately. Let me check the digit place approach again.\n\nWait, in the digit place approach, when counting units place, I included one-digit and two-digit numbers, so:\n\nUnits place for 4: 49 times (as calculated)\nTens place for 4: 40 times\nHundreds place for 4: 89 times\nTotal: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\nUnits:49, Tens:39, Hundreds:0\nTotal:88\n\nBut in the page length approach, I had 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the page length approach. Let me think again.\n\nIn the page length approach, for three-digit numbers, I considered hundreds, tens, and units places separately. But when I added up, I might have miscounted.\n\nWait, let's try to calculate the total number of 4's and 8's using the digit place approach, which seems more accurate.\n\nSo, using the digit place approach:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4:49\n  - 8:49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4:40\n  - 8:39\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4:89\n  - 8:0\n\nTotal 4's:49 +40 +89=178\nTotal 8's:49 +39 +0=88\n\nDifference:178 -88=90\n\nBut wait, in the page length approach, I got 188-98=90. Wait, no, 178-88=90 as well. So, both methods agree on the difference, even though the total counts differ.\n\nWait, that can't be, because 178-88=90, and 188-98=90. So, the difference is the same, but the totals are different. That suggests that the discrepancy lies in the total counts, but the difference remains the same.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the page length approach. Let me check the three-digit numbers again.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488)\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times (10 each from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\nTotal:89 +40 +39=168\n\nBut according to the digit place approach, units place for 4 is 49, which includes one-digit and two-digit numbers. So, in the page length approach, I had:\n\nOne-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:168\nTotal:1+19+168=188\n\nBut according to the digit place approach, units place is 49, which includes one-digit (1), two-digit (9), and three-digit (39). Similarly, tens place is 40 for 4, which includes two-digit (9) and three-digit (31? Wait, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconcile these counts.\n\nWait, in the digit place approach, the tens place for 4 is 40, which includes:\n\n- Two-digit numbers: pages 40-49:10 pages, so 10 times in tens place.\n- Three-digit numbers: in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 times in tens place, so 3\u00d710=30, plus 440-449 in 400-488:10 times. So total 30 +10=40.\n\nSimilarly, in the page length approach, for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 19 times. That includes 10 in tens place (40-49) and 9 in units place (14,24,...,94). So, 10 +9=19.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, which includes:\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n- Tens place:40\n- Units place:39\n\nBut according to the digit place approach, the total 4's are 178, which is 1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) =188. Wait, that's not matching.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the digit place approach is more accurate because it systematically counts each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nSo, according to the digit place approach:\n\n- Units place:49 each for 4 and 8\n- Tens place:40 for 4, 39 for 8\n- Hundreds place:89 for 4, 0 for 8\n\nTotal 4's:49 +40 +89=178\nTotal 8's:49 +39 +0=88\nDifference:178-88=90\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nBut in the page length approach, I had:\n\n- One-digit:4 appears once, 8 appears once\n- Two-digit:4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times\n- Three-digit:4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, both methods give the same difference, even though the total counts differ. That suggests that the difference is correctly calculated as 90, but the total counts might have discrepancies because of overlapping counts in different digit places.\n\nWait, perhaps the page length approach overcounts because, for example, in three-digit numbers, when counting hundreds, tens, and units, it's correct, but when adding one-digit and two-digit, it's separate. So, perhaps the digit place approach is more accurate, giving 178-88=90.\n\nBut since both methods give the same difference, perhaps the answer is 90.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure. Let me think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately using the digit place approach.\n\nAs above:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's:40\n- 8's:39\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49+40+89=178\nTotal 8's:49+39+0=88\nDifference:178-88=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range of Page Numbers:**\n   - The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Break Down by Digit Places:**\n   - Page numbers can be one-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488).\n\n3. **Count Occurrences of 4 and 8 in Each Digit Place:**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - **4's:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and one partial decade (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n     - **8's:** Similarly, 49 occurrences.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - **4's:** Each hundred (100-199, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences. For 100-399, that's 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, 440-449 adds 10, totaling 40.\n     - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10, totaling 30. In 400-488, 480-488 adds 9, totaling 39.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - **4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n     - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Sum the Occurrences:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - 178 (4's) - 88 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: For every 10 consecutive pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages. To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, from page 1 to page 488, the units digit cycles exactly 48 full times (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more pages (481-488). In those 8 pages, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 4's in units place are 48.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each set of 100 pages has 10 instances where the tens digit is 4 (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. But wait, the last partial hundred is from 400-488, which is 89 pages. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear in the last partial hundred? Let's see, from 400-409: 10 times, 410-419: another 10, and so on until 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages, so does that affect the count? Hmm, no, because the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, right? Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 only when the page is 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let me think: Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes 10 times for the tens digit 4, except the last one. Wait, no, the last block is 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 block, but the tens digit here is 8, not 4. So, actually, the tens digit 4 appears in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479. That's 8 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 8*10=80. Wait, but that can't be right because 400-488 is only 89 pages, so 8 full decades (400-409, etc.) would take up 80 pages, and then 8 more pages (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears 8*10=80 times in the 400-488 block. So, overall, the tens digit 4 appears 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 80? Wait, no, because the first four hundreds would be 0-399, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears 80 times as calculated. So total tens digit 4's are 40+80=120? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think differently. For the tens place, in each group of 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 0-99: 10 times, 100-199: 10 times, 200-299: 10 times, 300-399: 10 times, and 400-488: how many times? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 has a tens digit of 8, so the last set where the tens digit is 4 is 470-479. So, from 400-479, that's 80 pages, which is 8 sets of 10, so 8*10=80. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 4 appears 80 times. So, total tens digit 4's are 4*10 (from 0-399) + 80 (from 400-479) = 40+80=120.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (120) + hundreds (89) = 48+120=168, 168+89=257. So, total 4's are 257.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4's, every 10 pages, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, contributing 48 8's. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, total units 8's: 48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: For the tens digit, in each block of 100 pages, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 0-99: 10 times, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: how many? From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens 8's: 4*10 (from 0-399) +9=40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is total 4's minus total 8's: 257-98=159.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (from 48 full decades) + 0 (last 8 pages don't include 4 in units) = 48.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, tens digit 4 appears 80 times (from 400-479, 8 sets of 10), so 40+80=120.\n- Hundreds: 89 pages (400-488), so 89.\nTotal 4's: 48+120+89=257.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digit 8 appears once, so 48+1=49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10, so 4*10=40, plus in 400-488, tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 257-98=159.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 159 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 full decades (480 pages), contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so total units 4's = 48.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (0-399), contributing 40 fours. In the 400-488 range, 4 appears in the tens place for 80 pages (400-479), adding 80 fours. Total tens 4's = 40 + 80 = 120.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 pages. So, hundreds 4's = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 120 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 257.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 full decades, contributing 48 eights. The last 8 pages (481-488) include one 8 in the units place, so total units 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 eights. In the 400-488 range, 8 appears in the tens place for 9 pages (480-488), adding 9 eights. Total tens 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page number exceeds 488, so hundreds 8's = 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Total 4's = 257\n   - Total 8's = 98\n   - Difference = 257 - 98 = 159\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{159}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because the number of times a digit appears in each place might be different. Let me start by figuring out how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nFor the units place, every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,...,10. The digit 4 appears once in the units place (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. \n\nNow, the total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete groups of 10 pages is 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So for 48 groups, that's 48 times each. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in the units place, 4 appears once (page 484), and 8 appears once (page 488). \n\nSo, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, meaning 8 appears once more, but 484 is within that. So yeah, both get an extra 1. So units place: 49 each.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4, it appears 10 times in the tens place (pages 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (pages 80-89). \n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let's figure out how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages into the fifth hundred.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 88 is less than 100). \n\nIn the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, but 449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, pages 480-489 would have 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 times for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. When the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the end. So yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So, let's see when each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are one or two-digit numbers). But in our case, since we're only considering page numbers starting from 1, maybe we don't count 0 as a valid hundreds digit. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place here.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. So, 4 and 8 don't appear here.\n\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2. Again, 4 and 8 don't appear.\n\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3. Still, 4 and 8 don't appear.\n\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all these pages. How many times? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full groups of 10, so 48 times each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n- 488 pages mean 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0-8.\n- For 4 in tens place: 440-449 is 10 pages, so +10.\n- For 8 in tens place: 480-488 is 9 pages, so +9.\n- So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nTotal counts:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each digit place, calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach to count the digits.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to page N is floor((N + 1)/10) + min(max(0, (N + 1) mod 10 - d), 0). Wait, maybe that's more complicated, but let me try.\n\nWait, for units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly floor(N/10) times, and then if the units digit of N is >= d, we add 1. But since we're starting from 1, maybe it's a bit different.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with my initial approach because it worked out.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, each digit appears floor(N/100)*10 times, plus the extra from the remaining pages.\n\nIn this case, N=488.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds is 4, so 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nRemaining pages: 488 - 400 = 88 pages.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 88 is the tens part). So, the digit 4 appears once in the tens place (from 440-449, which is 10 pages), and 8 appears once in the tens place (from 480-488, which is 9 pages). So, that's 10 and 9 respectively, as I had before.\n\nSo, 40 +10=50 for 4, 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: as before, 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."
