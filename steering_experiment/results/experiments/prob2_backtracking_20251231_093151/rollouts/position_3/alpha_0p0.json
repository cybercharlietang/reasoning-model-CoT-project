    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to page 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4. That's 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 48th block. In those extra pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (from 400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages: 400-409. So, that's another 10 times. So, total for tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have 8 in the units place once (page 488). So, total units place is 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds in 488, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages: 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 pages, but since 488 is the last page, it's 9 pages. Hmm, let me think. Wait, actually, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times. So, total tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding these up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. For the tens place in the remaining 88 pages, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when does the tens digit become 8? From 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total for 8 is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 times.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4, the hundreds place added 89, making it 188. So, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8 in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 pages, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 8. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as I did before, 40 from the full hundreds, and 9 from the last partial hundred, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can write a small table to count the occurrences.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. Let me recount that.\n\nFrom page 1 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40, plus in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 +10=50. Wait, earlier I thought it was 50, but then I had 40 +10=50. Wait, but in the initial calculation, I had 40 from the full hundreds and 10 from the last partial hundred, making 50. But earlier, I thought that in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, which is correct because 440-449 is 10 pages. So, that's 10 more, making it 50. So, units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, but in the case of 8, it only appeared 9 times because the book ends at 488. So, perhaps that's why 8's tens place was 49 instead of 50.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again for 8's in the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSo, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula or a more systematic method.\n\nFor any digit position, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by considering each digit separately.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times d appears = (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, actually, it's a bit more nuanced. Let me recall the standard method.\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times a digit appears by breaking down the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it for this problem, but perhaps it's better to use that method to cross-verify.\n\nLet me try that for the digit 4 in the units place.\n\nn = 488\n\nWe're looking at the units digit.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nhigher = n // 10 = 48\ncurrent = n % 10 = 8\nlower = n % 1 = 0 (but lower doesn't matter for units place)\n\nSo, count = higher * 10^0 (since units place) + min(max(current - 4, 0), 10)\n\nWait, actually, I think the formula is:\n\ncount = higher * 10^k + (if current > d then 10^k else 0) + (if current == d then lower + 1 else 0)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think as follows:\n\nFor the units place (k=0), the number of times 4 appears is:\n\nnumber of complete groups of 10: higher = 488 // 10 = 48\neach group contributes 1 occurrence, so 48 * 1 = 48\nthen, check the remainder: 488 % 10 = 8\nsince 8 >= 4, add 1 more occurrence\nso total units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nk=1, divisor=100, remainder=10\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\ncount = higher * 10 + (if current > 4 then 10 else 0) + (if current ==4 then lower +1 else 0)\n\nSo, higher=4, current=8, lower=8\n\nSince current=8 >4, add 10\nso count = 4*10 +10 + (if current==4? no, so 0) = 40 +10=50\n\nWhich matches our earlier count of 50 for 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nk=2, divisor=1000, remainder=100\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\ncount= higher*100 + (if current>4 then 100 else 0) + (if current==4 then lower +1 else 0)\n\nhigher=0, current=4, lower=88\n\nsince current=4, add lower +1 =88 +1=89\n\nso count=0 +0 +89=89\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8:\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher=488//10=48\ncurrent=8\nlower=0\n\ncount=48*1 + (if 8>8? no, so 0) + (if 8==8 then lower +1 else 0) =48 +0 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\ncount=4*10 + (if 8>8? no, so 0) + (if 8==8 then lower +1 else 0) =40 +0 + (8+1)=49\n\nWait, that gives 40 +0 +9=49, which is correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nhigher=488//1000=0\ncurrent=(488//100)%10=4\nlower=488%100=88\n\ncount=0*100 + (if 4>8? no) + (if 4==8? no) =0\n\nSo, total for 8 is 49 +49 +0=98\n\nWhich matches our earlier count.\n\nSo, using this formula, we get the same results. So, 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the book has 488 pages, so pages are from 1 to 488. So, does that include page 488? Yes, so our calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe digit 4 appears 188 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, and the same goes for 8.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once per each set of 10) plus one more time in the 484th page. Wait, no, 484 is in the 480s, so actually, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 48 times from the complete sets, plus one more in 488, so 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I need to adjust.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490?), but wait, 488 is less than 490, so actually, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, for each digit 0-9, they appear 48 times, but the last digit might be less. Wait, no, for units digits, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each set of 10, but if the total number isn't a multiple of 10, the last partial set will have only some digits.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of it as for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula. For the units place, the number of times a digit d appears is (n / 10) + something depending on the remainder.\n\nWait, maybe I should look up the standard way to calculate digit occurrences. I think the formula is as follows: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears is (n // 10) + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0). But wait, actually, for each full group of 10, each digit appears once. So, for n pages, the number of times digit d appears in the units place is (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if d <= (n % 10) else 0). But wait, no, that's not quite right because if n mod 10 is greater than or equal to d, then d appears an extra time in the incomplete group.\n\nWait, actually, the formula is:\n\nFor units place:\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly for tens place:\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + (min(max((n % 100) - d*10 + 1, 0), 10) if d != 0 else (n % 100) + 1)\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to break it down manually for each digit place.\n\nLet me try for the units place first.\n\nFor units place:\nEach digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) will have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, so yes, both 4 and 8 appear once in the remaining 8 pages. So units place gives 49 for both.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1 (10-19), up to 9 (90-99). So each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place. So for digits 4 and 8, each appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place from these complete sets.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. In the tens place, these pages have tens digits from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Wait, no, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, ..., 481-488: tens digit 8. So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, how many times do 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFor digit 4: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, our remaining pages are 401-488, so 440-449 is within this range. So, from 440-449, that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, 10 times.\n\nFor digit 8: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 in 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, right? So from 480-488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times and digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo total tens place counts:\n- 4: 40 (from complete sets) + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 (from complete sets) + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but wait, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the exact number of times each digit appears depends on the range. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- 1: 411-420 (10 pages)\n- 2: 421-430 (10 pages)\n- 3: 431-440 (10 pages)\n- 4: 441-450 (10 pages)\n- 5: 451-460 (10 pages)\n- 6: 461-470 (10 pages)\n- 7: 471-480 (10 pages)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nWait, but 401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 is another 10, etc., up to 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 0: 10\n- 1: 10\n- 2: 10\n- 3: 10\n- 4: 10\n- 5: 10\n- 6: 10\n- 7: 10\n- 8: 8\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8*10 + 8, but that doesn't add up. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) and then 8 more pages. Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 88 = 8*11, which doesn't make sense. Wait, actually, 488 - 400 = 88, so from 401 to 488, inclusive, that's 88 pages. So, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages\n411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages\n421-430: tens digit 2, 10 pages\n431-440: tens digit 3, 10 pages\n441-450: tens digit 4, 10 pages\n451-460: tens digit 5, 10 pages\n461-470: tens digit 6, 10 pages\n471-480: tens digit 7, 10 pages\n481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, adding to the earlier 40 from the complete sets, we have:\n\n- 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's would be 9, but now it's 8. Hmm, let me double-check. From 481-488, that's 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So that's 8 times. So, 8 times in the remaining 88 pages, plus 40 from the complete sets, total 48.\n\nSo, so far, units place: 49 each, tens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for certain ranges. Wait, since we're dealing with a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 0: appears in pages 1-99, so 99 times, but wait, actually, in the hundreds place, 0 doesn't appear because page numbers don't have leading zeros. So, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 only for pages 1-99, but in terms of digit counts, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, but since we're counting digits printed, the hundreds digit is 0 only if we consider leading zeros, which we don't. So, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 pages, so 100 times\n- Digit 2: 200-299, 100 times\n- Digit 3: 300-399, 100 times\n- Digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n- Digits 0,5-9: don't appear in the hundreds place except for 4.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking for 4's and 8's, so let's see:\n\n- Digit 4 in hundreds place: 89 times (pages 400-488)\n- Digit 8 in hundreds place: does it appear? Only if there were pages 800-899, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 to the count of 4's and 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8. So 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488, units digits 1-8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place: 48 + 1 = 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - For 4: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n  - For 8: tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, earlier I thought it was 8, but 488 - 480 +1 =9 pages. So, 9 times.\nSo, total tens place:\n- 4: 40 +10=50\n- 8:40 +9=49\n\nWait, earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times for 8 in the tens place. So, that's 49 for 8 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48, but now it's 49. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, tens place for 8:40 +9=49\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in tens place: 40 +10=50\n\nSo, now, hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nWait, wait, earlier I thought 8's in tens place was 48, but now it's 49. So, total 8's would be 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 each, tens place 49 for 8, so total 98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's were 97, but now it's 98. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me recast the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 480 +1=9 pages. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the remaining pages, plus 40 from the complete sets, total 49.\n\nSo, 8's in tens place:49\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:98\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's were 97, but now it's 98. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the units place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 pages: 48 full sets of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8 in units place: 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages:481-488, units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So, units place:48+1=49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4 complete hundreds: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 8 in tens place: 4*10=40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - For 4: tens digit 4 is in 440-449:10 pages.\n  - For 8: tens digit 8 is in 480-488:9 pages.\nSo, 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488:89 pages.\n- 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier I thought 8's were 97, but that was a mistake. It's actually 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages:480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages, plus 40 from the complete sets, total 49.\n\nSo, yes, 8's total 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, the final counts are:\n\n4's:188\n\n8's:98\n\nDifference:90\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nBut since I'm doing it manually, let me try another approach.\n\nFor each digit place:\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 4 <= (488 % 10) else 0) = 48 + 1=49\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 8 <= (488 %10) else 0)=48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)*10 + (min( (488 %100) - 4*10 +1, 10) if 4 >=1 else 0 )\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\n(higher digits) * 10 + min(max( (current digit) *10 +1, d*10 +1), (higher digits +1)*10 )\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to stick with my earlier manual count.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)*100 + (if 4 >=1, then ... ) Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think that in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place:89\n\n8's in hundreds place:0\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. Maybe I can check with a smaller number to see if my method is correct.\n\nFor example, let's say a 10-page book. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nPage numbers 1-10.\n\n4's: page 4 \u21921 occurrence\n\n8's: page 8 \u21921 occurrence\n\nDifference:0\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: floor(10/10)=1, and since 4<=0 (10%10=0), no, so units 4's:1\n\nSimilarly, 8's: floor(10/10)=1, and 8<=0? No, so units 8's:1\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: floor(10/100)=0, so 0, and in the remaining 10 pages, tens digit is 1 for 10-19, but since we only have up to 10, tens digit is 0 for 1-9 and 1 for 10. So, 4's in tens place:0\n\n8's in tens place:0\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nSo, total 4's:1+0+0=1\n\nTotal 8's:1+0+0=1\n\nDifference:0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test: 20-page book.\n\n4's: pages 4,14 \u21922 times\n\n8's: pages 8,18 \u21922 times\n\nDifference:0\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: floor(20/10)=2, and since 4<=0 (20%10=0), no extra. So 2\n\n8's: same, 2\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: floor(20/100)=0, and in the remaining 20 pages, tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, but since we only have up to 20, it doesn't. So 0\n\n8's: same, 0\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 4's:2+0+0=2\n\nTotal 8's:2+0+0=2\n\nDifference:0, correct.\n\nAnother test: 50-page book.\n\n4's: pages 4,14,24,34,40-49. Wait, 40-49 have 10 4's in units place, plus 4 in 4,14,24,34. So total 14.\n\nWait, no, 40-49: each has a 4 in the tens place, so 10 times. Plus 4 in units place: 4,14,24,34,44. Wait, 44 is counted twice, once in units and once in tens.\n\nWait, no, in the units place, 4 appears once every 10 pages, so from 1-50, units 4's:5 times (4,14,24,34,44). Tens 4's:10 times (40-49). So total 15.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: units 8's:5 times (8,18,28,38,48). Tens 8's:0 (since 50 is the limit, so 80-89 isn't included). So total 5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's: floor(50/10)=5, and 4<=0? 50%10=0, so no extra. So 5.\n\n8's: same, 5.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: floor(50/100)=0, and in the remaining 50 pages, tens digit 4 is in 40-49:10 times.\n\nSo, 0 +10=10.\n\n8's: floor(50/100)=0, and tens digit 8 would be in 80-89, but we only have up to 50, so 0.\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 4's:5+10+0=15\n\nTotal 8's:5+0+0=5\n\nDifference:10, correct.\n\nSo, my method works for smaller numbers. Therefore, applying it to 488 pages, the difference should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should separate the counting based on the number of digits. So, let's start with one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for one-digit numbers, the count of 4's is 1, and the count of 8's is also 1. That means there's no difference here yet.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place, then do the same for 8.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place: In the two-digit numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (1 through 9), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. That means there are 9 times 1, so 9 times 4 in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. For each tens digit, the units digits go from 0 to 9, so yes, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nSo, adding up the two-digit numbers: For 4's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. For 8's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, no difference here either.\n\nMoving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 100 to 199, 200 to 299, 300 to 399, and 400 to 488.\n\nLet's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's only in the range 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800 to 899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 0 to 9. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nLet's consider each hundred range separately:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). But wait, in the range 100-199, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, so for each digit, it appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\n2. 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n3. 300-399: Again, same pattern. 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, that's only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this range.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, adding up all the hundreds:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times as well, right? Because 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's break it down by each hundred range.\n\n1. 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. Since there are 10 tens groups, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above. 4 appears 10 times in the units place, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Same. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the units digit goes from 0 to 9 for each tens digit, but the tens digits go up to 8. Let's see:\n\n- For each tens digit (0-8), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each tens digit, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n\n- There are 9 tens digits (0-8), so 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400-409, units digits 0-9: 4 appears once (404), 8 appears once (408).\n\nSimilarly, 410-419: 414, 418.\n\nAnd so on up to 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 only goes up to 8 in the units place, right? So, for 480-488, the units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, for each tens group from 400-409 up to 480-488, the units digits 0-9 (or 0-8 in the last group) include 4 and 8 once each, except the last group where units go only up to 8.\n\nWait, but actually, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each with units digits 0-9 except the last one, which is 0-8. So, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once per tens group, and 8 appears once per tens group. For tens digit 8, the units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in total, for each tens group from 0 to 8, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place. So, 9 tens groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times 1 = 9 for 4, and 9 times 1 = 9 for 8.\n\nWait, but in the last tens group (480-488), units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is 488, so 8 appears once. So, yes, 9 times each.\n\nSo, adding up the units place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\n- 8 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, in 400-488, the units digits for each tens group (except the last one) go up to 9, so for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once per group, and 8 appears once per group. That's 8 groups, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, so 8 times each. Then, for the last group, tens digit 8, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place in 400-488: 9 times each.\n\nWait, so that would make it 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, total units place counts:\n\n- 4: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\n- 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (400-488).\n\n- Tens place: 40 times.\n\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\nTotal for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 39 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. So, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times and 8 appears 78 times.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a large discrepancy.\n\nWait, let's go back. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times for 4, 10 for 8.\n\n- 200-299: 10 each.\n\n- 300-399: 10 each.\n\n- 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 for 4 in the tens place.\n\nAnd 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each.\n\n- 200-299: 10 each.\n\n- 300-399: 10 each.\n\n- 400-488: 9 each.\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 each.\n\nSo, yes, 4 appears 39 times in the units place, and 8 appears 39 times as well.\n\nSo, total for 4 in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nFor 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- One-digit: 1.\n\n- Two-digit: 19.\n\n- Three-digit: 168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- One-digit: 1.\n\n- Two-digit: 19.\n\n- Three-digit: 78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check that again because I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, 4 appears 168 times, and 8 appears 78 times. So, the difference in three-digit numbers alone is 168 - 78 = 90. Then, in one-digit and two-digit numbers, both have the same count for 4 and 8, so the overall difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the three-digit counts again because 168 seems high.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. In the tens place, 40 times, and in the units place, 39 times. 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8, in the tens place, 39 times, and units place, 39 times. 39 + 39 = 78. So, yes.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me check if I counted correctly in each place.\n\nIn the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4, it's 10 times in each hundred range except the last one, where it's 10 times as well, so 40 times total. For 8, it's 10 times in each of the first three hundred ranges and 9 times in the last, so 39 times.\n\nIn the units place, for 4, it's 10 times in each of the first three hundred ranges and 9 times in the last, so 39 times. Same for 8.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nThen, adding the one-digit and two-digit numbers, which both have 1 and 19 each, so total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I overcounted in the three-digit numbers?\n\nWait, in the units place for 400-488, I considered each tens group contributing once for 4 and once for 8. But in the last tens group, 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, but 488 is also included. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in that group.\n\nSo, for each tens group from 400-409 up to 480-488, there are 9 groups, each contributing once for 4 and once for 8 in the units place. So, 9 times each, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 400-488, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times for 4. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers.\n\n1. **One-digit page numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit page numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 19 times, 8 appears 19 times.\n\n3. **Three-digit page numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit numbers: 4 appears 168 times, 8 appears 78 times.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each position.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 480th page, the units digit is 0, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each group of 10, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 480th page, the units digit is 0, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 488 include another 4 in the units place? Wait, 488's units digit is 8, so no. So, actually, it's 48 times. Wait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So total 4's in units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So, how many such groups are there up to 488?\n\nLet's see. The first group is 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Then 240-249: another 10. Then 340-349: another 10. Then 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. Then, what about 540-549? Wait, 540 is beyond 488, so that's not included. So how many groups is that? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 488 include all of that? Wait, 440-449 is up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 are included. So total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page with a 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, how many numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive? It's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So total 4's: 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4's, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So 48 times. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups, each with an 8 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's.\n\nSo how many such groups are there? Let's list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so the first four groups are complete, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. The last group, 480-488, is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 groups of 10 and one group of 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49 and tens place was 49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, that's correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 groups: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48, as each group of 10 contributes one 4, and 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 because in the last group (481-488), 8 appears once more. So 48 full groups (1-480) with 8 in units place, and then 488 adds another 8. So 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: 4 groups of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 4*10=40 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nTherefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. The last group (481-488) doesn't add another 4 in the units place.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 occurrences. The last group (481-488) adds one more 8 at 488.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers every 100 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 complete groups (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), contributing 40 occurrences. The last group (480-488) adds 9 more occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 187\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I should probably analyze the occurrence of the digit 4 and the digit 8 in each place and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. But since our range is from 1 to 488, I need to see how many full groups of 10 there are and then account for any remaining numbers.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in each position. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of times 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once as well (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from the complete groups) plus one more if the extra numbers include a 4. Wait, the extra numbers go up to 488, so the last number is 488. Let me check: from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once in the units place here as 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: in the complete groups, 48 times, and in the extra numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems like both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, but wait, let me check again. From 1 to 480, each group of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So yes, both have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place, let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1 to 488, we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's four complete hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, 1-100 is the first hundred, 101-200 the second, 201-300 the third, and 301-400 the fourth. Then 401-488 is the fifth partial hundred.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, in the first four hundreds (1-400), each digit 4 and 8 appears 4 times 10, which is 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 times (from 480 to 488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers are 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but I'm considering the tens place, so in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the first four hundreds, each 100 has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 = 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times. So total for tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if I'm correct here. Let me think again. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, four blocks give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For 8, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9 8's. So yes, total 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, there are no hundreds digits, so 0.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89).\n\nWait, but actually, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because we don't reach 800. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's total 188 and 8's total 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 each, so that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49, so that's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's have 89 and 8's have 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place in the partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the first four hundreds, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred, 401-488, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:9. So, total 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nEach group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete groups (since 488 /10 =48.8), so 48 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in those, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units place:48 +1=49, same for 8's:48 +1=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a lot. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again.\n\nWait, from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's every number from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers), and 8 in 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 10 and 9 respectively. So, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm overcounting in the tens place. Let me think about the numbers:\n\nFrom 1-100: 4's in tens place:40-49 (10 times), 8's:80-89 (10 times).\n\nSimilarly, from 101-200:140-149 (10 times), 180-189 (10 times).\n\nFrom 201-300:240-249 (10 times), 280-289 (10 times).\n\nFrom 301-400:340-349 (10 times), 380-389 (10 times).\n\nSo, that's 40 each for 4's and 8's in the tens place up to 400.\n\nThen, from 401-488:\n\n- 440-449:10 times 4 in tens place.\n- 480-488:9 times 8 in tens place.\n\nSo, 4's:10, 8's:9.\n\nTotal 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because the difference seems quite large. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1-488, that's 48 full groups, so 48 times, plus one more in 484. So, 49.\n\nTens place: every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, that's 4 times 10=40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10. So, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: from 400-488, 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49.\n\nTens place: from 1-400, 4 times 10=40. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the number 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. In the extra group, 484 has a 4 in the units place. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. From 1-400, it appears 40 times. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. From 1-400, it appears 40 times. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. \n\nIn each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Wait, the remaining numbers after 48 blocks would be from 481 to 488. Let me check those: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, the 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units digit 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: pages 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 pages, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be pages 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, because 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4's: 40 (from the hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. 8's: 40 (from the hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. That means 4's have 1 more in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the 401-488 range, the tens digit for 4's is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. For 8's, the tens digit is from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 4's have 10 more in this range, making the total 50, while 8's have 9, making the total 49. So, the tens place contributes 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has the same hundreds digit for all 100 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the 400-499 range, but since our book ends at 488, it's from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be needed, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. That's a significant difference.\n\nNow, let's tally up all the digits:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me add again. 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. For 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, how many 4's? Each block of 10 has one 4 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4, so 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place is correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 numbers have 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) would be 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449), so 40 + 10 = 50. For 8's in tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488), so 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place is correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. So, hundreds place is correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's. 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8's. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the counts make sense.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 (from 48 full decades) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 (from 48 full decades) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 (from 4 hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 (from 4 hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488.\n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many full sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with full sets, that's 48 full sets, and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 full sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to our count, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 divided by 10 is 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488). So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.), also 10 times per hundred.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and so does the tens digit 8. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see how the tens digit behaves. \n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, but since we're only going up to 488, which is 488 - 400 = 88 pages, that's 8 full tens (40-49, etc.) but wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 8 numbers here (481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 441-450, which is 10 times (441,442,...,450). So that's 10 times. How about 8? It appears in 481-488, but since there are only 8 pages, does that mean the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place? Wait, no, because each number from 481 to 488 has 8 in the tens place, so that's 8 times. So, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the 4 full hundreds, the total for the tens place is:\n\n- 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 4*10 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. That gives a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The last partial hundred is from 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, yes, that's correct. So, the total for tens place is 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is total 4's minus total 8's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages contribute 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n- Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 pages contribute 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 488 pages have 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10 = 40 for both.\n- Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages:\n   - 441-450: 10 fours\n   - 481-488: 8 eights\n- So, tens place for 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Tens place for 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total units place: 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n   - 488 pages have 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 441-450 adds 10 fours.\n     - 481-488 adds 8 eights.\n   - Total tens place: 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. So maybe I should calculate how many 4's appear in the units place, how many in the tens place, and how many in the hundreds place. Then do the same for 8's and subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to get the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. \n\nFirst, the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each of the 48 blocks, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would be the only number where 4 appears in the units place. So that's one more. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488. Wait, but in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the end, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place: Again, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So that's 1 more. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers, but wait, from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last 8, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last 88 numbers, 440-449 is 10, so 40+10=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last 8, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in the last 88, 480-488 is 9, so 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, like 4 or 8, I need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Maybe I should calculate how many times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. I'll consider the units place first. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, 4 appears once in the units place (page 4). Similarly, from 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on. So for every block of 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, the last block is from 481 to 490, but since the book ends at 488, I need to check if 484 is within this range. Yes, 484 is page 484, so that's another 4 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should think differently. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (blocks of 10) plus any extra pages beyond that. So 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So 48 times 1 (from each block) plus, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? Yes, at 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nOkay, so units place for 4: 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. Let's figure out how many such blocks exist in 488 pages.\n\nFirst, how many hundreds are there? 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So the blocks where the tens digit is 4 are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another block. Let me count them: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times 4 in the tens place. So 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nBut wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's correct. So 5 blocks, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but page 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and it goes up to 488, so yes, 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, yes, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me check again because that seems high.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think: from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So 89 in hundreds place. Then tens place: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 times, so 50. Units place: 49 times. So 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's. So I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to 4, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many blocks of 10? 48 full blocks (480 pages), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So 48 times from the blocks, plus in the last 8 pages, 488 is one of them, so that's another 8 in the units place. So 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, because in the last block, 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so 488 is the last page. So in 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 8 appears once in the units place in the last block. So units place for 8: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNow, tens place for 8. Similar to 4, 8 appears in blocks of 100. So from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that block.\n\nSo how many blocks? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 pages, because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9)\n\nWait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488. So that's 9 times in the tens place for 480-488.\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only go up to 488, so 9 pages. So each of those has a tens digit of 8. So that's 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place for 8: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 only from page 800 onwards, but our book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 188 times and 8's appear 98 times. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So 89 times. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place for 4's: 5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10 times, so 50.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units and tens each have 49.\n\nSo yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to find the number of times a specific digit appears, I need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4) and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. Since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to find out how many complete groups of 10 there are. \n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, for the units place, in each group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once. Therefore, for 48 complete groups, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 times in the units place. \n\nNow, I need to check the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488). In the units place of these, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, yes, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units place: 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. But since we're starting at 1, the first group is 1-10, where the tens digit is 0 for 1-9 and 1 for 10. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each hundred block.\n\nWait, actually, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. \n\nBut in our case, the book goes up to 488, so we have four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nWait, no, actually, 1-100 is the first hundred, 101-200 is the second, 201-300 the third, 301-400 the fourth, and then 401-488 is the fifth partial hundred. So, for the tens place, each complete hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 times, and similarly for 8.\n\nSo, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each complete hundred, that's 10 times. There are four complete hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449. That's 10 pages: 440-449. So, that's 10 more times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digits in this range go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 in the tens place occurs only once, from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, totaling 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, in each complete hundred, 10 times. So, 4 * 10 = 40. In the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages: 480-488. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. Therefore, total for 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 480 is the first and 488 is the last. So, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 8.\n- 48 * 1 = 48 for each.\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- So, 4: 48 +1 = 49, 8: 48 +1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred, 10 times for each digit.\n- 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 for 4, same for 8.\n- Partial hundred 401-488:\n  - For 4: 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more, total 50.\n  - For 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more, total 49.\n- So, 4:50, 8:49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I calculated the hundreds place, I thought 4 appears 89 times, which seems correct because 400 to 488 is 89 pages. But let me check that again. 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. And the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, from 481-488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, so 188 -98 =90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place? Because 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 is 1 digit, 10-99 is 2 digits, 100-488 is 3 digits.\n\nBut maybe that's not necessary. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, for each complete hundred, 10 times for each digit. So, 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40 for 8 in the tens place. Then, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to N is floor((N + 1)/10) *1 + (if d <= (N %10) then 1 else 0). But maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for units place, total occurrences of 4: floor(488/10)*1 + (if 4 <= 8 then 1 else 0). Wait, 488/10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. Then, since 4 <=8, add 1. So, 49. Similarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and 8<=8, so add 1, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For tens digit, each cycle is 100, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds and 88 pages into the fifth hundred.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place:\n- 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40\n- In the fifth hundred, check how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The fifth hundred starts at 401, so the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 more. Total 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n- 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40\n- In the fifth hundred, 480-488 has tens digit 8, which is 9 pages. So, 9 more.

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8 and sum them up.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. \n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last page is 488. Let me check how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and an additional 8 pages. So, in each complete set, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. \n\nLet me see how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. The first block is 40-49, which is within the first 100 pages. Then, each subsequent block is 100 pages apart. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. \n\nBut wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how about the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, in the units digit, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? \n\nAgain, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, counting 8 in the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488.\n\nLet me count how many such blocks there are. \n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, how about the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 98 times. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have missed something.\n\nWait, in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, comparing the counts: 4 appears 187 times, and 8 appears 98 times. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me just cross-verify.\n\nWait, 187 (4's) minus 98 (8's) equals 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4: 48 times, as 488/10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing a 4 in the units place. Then, the last partial decade (481-488) doesn't include a 4 in the units place, so total 48. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 8: 48 full decades, each contributing an 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial decade (481-488), 8 appears once (at 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full sets).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 blocks \u00d7 10).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers).\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full sets + 1 in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I'll start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about the units place first. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, the digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then seeing how many complete sets of 10 there are. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (since each set has one 4) plus 1 if the extra numbers include a 4. But in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so no 4 there. So, units place 4's total to 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it would be the same. Each set of 10 has one 8, so 48 times 1, and then in the extra 8 numbers, 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, units place 8's total to 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. The total number of units digits is 488, so from 1 to 488, each units digit cycles 48 times completely (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, for each digit, in the units place, the count would be 48 times 1 plus the number of times the digit appears in the extra 8 numbers. For 4, in 481-488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, so units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. For units digit 4: from 1 to 480, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8: from 1 to 480, 48 times. Then from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both units 4's and units 8's are 49 each. Hmm, that's interesting. So, maybe the difference isn't just in the units place. Let me check the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 in 80-89, 10 times.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40 times. Similarly, tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0\n410-419: tens digit 1\n...\n440-449: tens digit 4, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times\n450-459: tens digit 5\n...\n480-488: tens digit 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTens place 8's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, 488 is 4 hundreds, so the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4.\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, but in the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 49, and in the hundreds place, 4's were 89 and 8's were 0.\n\nSo, 49 (units 4) + 50 (tens 4) + 89 (hundreds 4) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units 8) + 49 (tens 8) + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place. When calculating units 4's, from 1-488, every 10 numbers have one 4 in the units place, so 48 full tens, giving 48, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: 48 full tens, and then in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nTens place 8's: in each hundred, 10 times, so 40. Then in 401-488, tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480, plus one more 4 in 484. Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. Plus one more 8 in 488. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. Four hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 440-449. Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. Four hundreds give 40, plus 9 in 480-488. Total: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appears 89 times in 400-488.\n   - **8's:** Never appears. Total: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n\nFor the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nWell, for every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks of 10, and then we have 8 remaining numbers (481 to 488). \n\nSo, in each block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: In each block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 blocks give 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears at 488, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so so far, the count for 4's and 8's in the units place is equal. Hmm, maybe the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of 4's in the tens place.\n\nIn each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each hundred, that's 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 8 times.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for when the tens digit is 4. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's correct, 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 50.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place. Let's do the same.\n\nIn each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, 4 blocks of 100 give 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no: 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. But wait, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since 488 is the last page, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in tens place were 50, and 8's are 49. So, so far, 4's are leading by 1 in the tens place.\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, right? Because those are two-digit numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. The number of pages here is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive), but wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, how about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book, since the highest page is 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\n**Now, let's sum up the totals for each digit place.**\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once at 484. So, 49.\n- 8's: Similarly, 48 full tens, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: Each hundred has 10 pages with tens digit 4, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n- 8's: Each hundred has 10 pages with tens digit 8, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89.\n- 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** 49 times (48 from full tens, plus 1 in the last 8 pages)\n   - **8's:** 49 times (48 from full tens, plus 1 in the last page)\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** 50 times (40 from full hundreds, plus 10 in the range 440-449)\n   - **8's:** 49 times (40 from full hundreds, plus 9 in the range 480-488)\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** 89 times (pages 400-488)\n   - **8's:** 0 times\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. \n   - To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10. But since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I'll take the integer part. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full sets of 10. Each set contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. But wait, I should check if the remaining pages after 480 have a 4 in the units place. Pages 481-488: 481, 482, ..., 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so no 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's total is 48.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49). \n   - So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, check the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488). In this range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNext, let's count the number of 8's using the same method.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, contributing 48 8's. Now, check the remaining pages 481-488. The units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89. So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, check the remaining 88 pages (400-488). The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 from page 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which doesn't add another 4)\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds (400 each) \u00d7 10 = 40, plus in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449), so 10, total 50\n- Hundreds: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, plus 1 in 488, so 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds \u00d710=40, plus in 400-488, tens digit 8 from 480-489, but only up to 488, so 9 numbers, total 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (once every 10 pages, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48)\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (40 per 100 pages \u00d7 4 hundreds + 10 in 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (48 full tens + 1 in 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (40 per 100 pages \u00d7 4 hundreds + 9 in 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. To find out how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10. \n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, that would give me 48 times, but actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each cycle being 10 numbers) and then 8 more numbers (481 to 488). In those 8 extra numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear. So the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times every 100 numbers. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.). So for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 440-449. So that's another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (40-49, 140-149, etc.) but wait, no, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So yes, 10 more. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 48 (units) + 50 (tens) = 98, plus 89 (hundreds) is indeed 187.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In those 8 extra numbers, the units digit is 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such range has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So how many such ranges are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 times, and the last one (480-488) contributes 9 times. So total tens place 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So the hundreds place contributes 0 times.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that. Units: 49, tens: 49, so total 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total cycles: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full cycles.\n   - 48 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Full hundreds: 4 (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Last 88 pages (401-488): 440-449 contributes another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once.\n   - Full cycles: 48, contributing 48.\n   - Pages 481-488: 8 appears once at 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contribute 10.\n   - Four full ranges: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Pages 480-488: 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for the units place: The 4's appear every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. To find how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives me 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48. So, there are 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nNext, for the tens place: The 4's appear in blocks of 100, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, the last block is only up to 488, not 499, but the tens digit is still 4 in 440-449. So, how many full blocks are there? From 0-99: one block (40-49), 100-199: another (140-149), 200-299: another (240-249), 300-399: another (340-349), and 400-488: another (440-449). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The 4's appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 up to 488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but I'm counting 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in hundreds place is 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for 8's. I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full occurrences. But wait, does 488 end with an 8? Yes, so actually, it's 49 occurrences because 488 is included. Wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The last one is 488, which is 48*10 + 8 = 488. So, the number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Because 8, 18, ..., 488 is 49 numbers. So, units place: 49.\n\nNext, tens place: 8's appear in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are there in 488 pages. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block. 100-199: 180-189 is another. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: Does 480-489 fall within 488? 480-489 would be pages 480 to 489, but the book only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is still present, but only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but for the tens place, each block is 100 numbers, so 480-489 is part of the 400-499 range, but since our book ends at 488, the 8 in the tens place occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks do we have? From 0-99: one block (80-89). 100-199: another (180-189). 200-299: another (280-289). 300-399: another (380-389). And 400-488: the 8 in the tens place occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not a full block. So, for the tens place, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Plus the 9 from 480-488. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place was 49, tens place 49, so total 98. But let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? The first is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The sequence is 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place is indeed 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: as calculated, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting 4's.\n\nWait, when I counted 4's in the hundreds place, I said from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50.\n\nIn the units place, 48.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 48 = 187.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place per block.\n\nHow many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block.\n\n100-199: 140-149.\n\n200-299: 240-249.\n\n300-399: 340-349.\n\n400-488: 440-449.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's the fifth block. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 10 each, so 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 + 50 + 48 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer would be 89, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full occurrences, but since 488 ends with 8, not 4, it's 48. Wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of complete decades, which is floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus 1 if the last digit is >=4. Wait, no, actually, it's better to think of it as 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is 484. So, 48 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 488 / 10 = 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and since 488 ends with 8, that's 49 times.\n\nWait, so for 4's in units place: 48.\n\nFor 8's in units place: 49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: as before, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 4 blocks of 10, plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But does each of these contribute an 8 in the tens place? Let's see: 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, ..., up to 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nSo, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades in 488 pages, so 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 4's, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers. Since 488 ends with 8, there are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (40 each) and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in 488 pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, I'll consider each position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's on page 4; in 11-20, it's on page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with complete sets, that's 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, there's also the 480-488 range. In this last partial set, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more on page 484. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so that's four full hundreds. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 is 40. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (from 401 to 488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's another 10 times. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 401 to 488, the tens digit being 4 occurs from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's correct, adding 10 more, making it 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8. I'll follow the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place. As before, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once on page 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for every block of 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, it's 80-89, which is 10 times. Similarly, 101-200 has 180-189, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nHow many complete hundreds are there? 488 / 100 = 4.88, so four full hundreds. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. Wait, that's only 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, in this case, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (pages 480, 481, ..., 488). So, adding that, the total tens place 8's is 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480, which is page 480, and goes up to 488. So, that's 9 pages, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899. But since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, 0 occurrences here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off because earlier I thought the tens place for 8's would be 49, but let me double-check. From 1-400, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times every 100, so 4 times 10 is 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 8's was 49, but let me check that again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Each 10 numbers contribute one 8, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once on 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But wait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so +10, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, checking the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, so 48. Then, 488 adds one more, so 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, four hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9, making it 49.\n\nHundreds place: None, since the book only goes up to 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that maybe the hundreds place for 8's would contribute, but no, since 800-899 isn't included. So, yes, 98 8's and 188 4's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place, from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, etc., but for 400-488, it's 4. So, 89 times.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0). But wait, that's not exactly accurate. Actually, for each digit d in the units place, the number of times it appears up to N is (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think.\n\nActually, for the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly N // 10 times, and then if the units digit of N is greater than or equal to d, we add 1 more. But since we're starting from 1, not 0, the first page is 1, so the units digit cycles from 1 to 9, then 0. Hmm, maybe it's better to adjust for that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think of the units digit as cycling every 10 numbers, starting from 1. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place every 10 numbers. But since we start at 1, the first cycle (1-10) has 0 appearing once on page 10. So, for N pages, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is floor((N + 9 - d) / 10). Wait, maybe that's a formula I can use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for digit frequency.\n\nWait, maybe I can use a more systematic approach. Let me try this for the units digit:\n\nFor digit d in units place, the number of times it appears from 1 to N is:\n\nnumber = (N // 10) * (1 if d != 0 else 1) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nWait, but this might not be accurate because when d is 0, it's a bit different since page numbers start at 1, not 0.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that from 1 to N, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers, but the first cycle is 1-10, which has 0 only once. So, for d=0, the count is floor(N / 10) if N >= 10, else 0.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the initial method.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\n- For d=4, how many times does it appear? In every block of 10, it appears once. So, from 1-488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 48 full blocks (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each full block of 10, 4 appears once. So, 48 full blocks give 48 fours. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once on page 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8, units digit: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, 8 appears on page 488, so +1, total 49.\n\nOkay, that's correct.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\nEach digit d appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for d=4, in each hundred, it's 10 times. From 1-400, that's four hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total 50.\n\nFor d=8, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 pages. From 1-400, that's four hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9, making it 49.\n\nSo, tens place: 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor d=4, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nFor d=8, there are no pages from 800-899, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large difference, but when I check each step, it seems correct.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. That's four sets, each 10 pages, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 pages, so 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four sets, 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so +9, making it 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, 188 vs 98, difference of 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. But let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 400-488 being 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. Therefore, in each block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear equally in the units place.\n\nBut wait, I should check how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48*1 +1=49, and similarly, 8's in the units place is 48*1 +1=49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0 or 1 (for 10). From 11-20, the tens digit is 1, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. Wait, actually, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each (for 0 in 1-9, 10-19, etc.), but actually, it's 10 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me consider how many times each digit appears in the tens place from 1 to 488. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 1-100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, from 101-200, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, and so on.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many hundreds do we have? 488 is 4*100 + 88. So, we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nIn each of these four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8. So, in each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, across four hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the remaining pages from 401 to 488? Let's see, from 401-488, the tens digit goes through 0-9 in each ten. So, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is a full set of 10 pages. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. For 8, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 pages. But wait, 480 is page 480, so 480-489 would be 10 pages, but 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages. Therefore, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining pages.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit occurs 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, and since we're stopping at 488, it's only 9 pages (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, in 440-449, that's 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times. For the tens digit 8, in 480-488, that's 9 pages, so 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, across all pages, 4 appears 40 (from four hundreds) +10=50 times, and 8 appears 40 +9=49 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the four hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs once in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 occurs in 480-488 (9 times). So, total for tens place: 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's: 40 +9=49. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 has one more occurrence in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the last 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, adding to the four hundreds, 4's tens: 40+10=50, 8's tens:40+9=49. So, yes, 4 appears once more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? The hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at maximum. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188 times.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0 = 98 times.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. So, 48*1=48 for each digit, plus in the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, total units: 48+1=49 for each digit. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, four hundreds: 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 occurs in 480-488 (9 times). So, total tens: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+9=49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 pages in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets (480 pages).\n   - Each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488. Here, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - **Total Units Place:** 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400): Each digit appears 40 times (4*10).\n   - Remaining pages (401-488):\n     - Tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **Total Tens Place:** 4 appears 50 times (40+10), 8 appears 49 times (40+9).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488 (89 pages).\n   - The hundreds digit is never 8 in this range.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:** 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, maybe I should calculate how many 4's appear in each place and do the same for 8's, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many 4's there are. I'll consider each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. How many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with complete sets, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, the last partial set is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. In this partial set, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit changes every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the tens place (440-449). But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but in the range 401-488, does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, because 440 is greater than 401 and 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 times. Wait, no, actually, when considering the tens place, each occurrence is for 10 numbers. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 times. But since 488 is less than 500, we don't go beyond 488. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the first four hundreds) plus 10 (from 440-449), totaling 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds would be 40, and then in the 400s, another 10, making it 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check that. 400 is the first page, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, correct. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 times. The last partial set is 481-488, which includes 8 in the units place (488). So, that's one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. How many hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. \n\nIn each full hundred, that's 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, each occurrence is 10 numbers. So, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, does that mean the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 8 for all numbers from 480 to 489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, does that mean 9 times? But wait, in the tens place, each occurrence is 10 numbers, so if we have a partial set, it's only 9. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100, so in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs exactly 10 times, regardless of the hundreds. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, which is 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times, not 10. Therefore, the total number of 8's in the tens place would be 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) plus 9 (from 480-488), totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For each hundred, 1-100: 10 times (80-89). 101-200: 10 times (180-189). 201-300: 10 times (280-289). 301-400: 10 times (380-389). Then 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 times for the digit 8.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 188 times, and 8's appear 98 times. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me go through this again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial cycle from 481-488 includes 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48. The last partial cycle from 481-488 includes 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. In the 400s, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4 again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4, in the 400s, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 8, in the 400s, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits seems correct as well.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full sets, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) \u2192 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full sets, contributing 48.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) \u2192 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place (pages go up to 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. Each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) can be analyzed separately to count the occurrences of each digit. So, I'll need to consider each position: units, tens, and hundreds. But wait, since 488 is a three-digit number, the hundreds place can go up to 4, and the tens and units can go up to 9, except for the last few pages where it might be less.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but not all hundreds digits are the same. Let me clarify. The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since page numbers start at 1, the hundreds digit starts at 0 (for pages 1-99) and then increases. Hmm, maybe it's better to break it down by each digit place.\n\nSo, I'll consider the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group of 8 numbers. In each complete group, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, for every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. Each complete block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Let's see, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 occurrences. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 401-488 is 88 numbers, and the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 8 times except for the last digit which might be less. Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently.\n\nActually, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 401-409) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, each digit from 0-8 appears exactly 9 times? Wait, no. Let me think: From 401-488, how many numbers are there? 488 - 400 = 88 pages. So, 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 88 / 10 = 8.8, meaning each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 8 or 9 times. Wait, actually, 88 divided by 10 is 8 full cycles and 8 extra. So, the tens digits 0-8 each appear 9 times except for the last one. Wait, no, let me correct that.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- ...\n- 481-490: tens digit 8 (but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers: 481-488)\n\nWait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, starting from 401 (tens digit 0), each subsequent 10 numbers increase the tens digit by 1. So, 401-410: tens 0 (10 numbers)\n411-420: tens 1 (10)\n...\n481-490: tens 8 (but 488 is the end, so 481-488 is 8 numbers). So, the tens digits from 0-7 each appear 10 times, and tens digit 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 401-488 had 88 numbers, so 8 full tens cycles plus 8. But in reality, each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, yes, 50 total.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, wait. When counting the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nUnits place: 48 times (as calculated earlier).\n\nTens place: 50 times.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similarly, for every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 48. Then, the partial group from 481-488: units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once in the partial group. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-489 would be 10, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 187 and 8's are 98. The question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me verify each part again.\n\nUnits place for 4:\n\nFrom 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in units. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which has 8 numbers (481-488). The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nTens place for 4:\n\nIn each hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10=50.\n\nHundreds place for 4:\n\nFrom 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each has 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1-488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in units. So, 48 full groups, 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers where tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNo hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 89 seems like a large difference. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try another approach for the units digit.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nFor 4's: In each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total sets = floor(488/10)=48, so 48 times. Then, check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 481,482,...,488. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear. So, 48.\n\nFor 8's: Similarly, in each set of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers: 481-488. Units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor 4's: In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). So, from 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50.\n\nFor 8's: In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, from 1-400, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's: From 400-488, 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nFor 8's: 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll go through each place one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last block is 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, we don't have a full 490th page. However, the units digit 4 still appears in 484, which is within 481-488. So, actually, we have 48 fours from the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (40-49). Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, and so on. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 fours. But wait, the last block is 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears from 401-410, 440-449, etc. Wait, actually, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, in the 400s, we have 10 fours in the tens place. So, in total, the tens place contributes 40 fours from 1-400, and then another 10 from 440-449, making it 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, that might be double-counting. Let me think again. From 1-100, 40-49: 10 fours. From 101-200, 140-149: another 10. From 201-300, 240-249: another 10. From 301-400, 340-349: another 10. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449: another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to fours, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 8 appears in 488, so that's one more. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: The tens digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-488, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (but only up to 488). So, for the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers (480-488). So, the tens place eights are: 4 blocks of 10 (80s, 180s, 280s, 380s) contributing 4*10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of fours is 187, and the total number of eights is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and in the last partial ten, 484 is the only one, so 48 + 1? Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 48, but actually, from 1-488, the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 4, ending at 484, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so earlier I thought units place fours were 48, but actually, it's 49. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the units place for fours. The units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the number of times 4,14,24,...,484 appear. So, starting at 4, each step +10. The number of terms is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place fours: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place fours: as before, 50.\n\nHundreds place fours: 89.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. Which is correct? Let me recount.\n\nUnits place: 49 fours.\n\nTens place: From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nNow, for eights:\n\nUnits place: 49 eights.\n\nTens place: 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I think I initially miscalculated the units place fours as 48 instead of 49, leading to an incorrect total of 187 instead of 188.\n\nSo, the correct total fours are 188, and eights are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me check the units place for eights again. From 1-488, the units digit 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms? It's an arithmetic sequence starting at 8, ending at 488, with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place eights: 49.\n\nTens place eights: as before, 49.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because earlier I thought the units place fours were 48, but upon recounting, it's 49. So, the correct total fours are 188, eights 98, difference 90.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure about the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place fours: five blocks of 10, each contributing 10 fours, so 50.\n\nUnits place fours: 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, total 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the answer was 89, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in my initial calculation by missing one in the units place fours.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 full blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributing 40.\n   - In the 400-488 range, 480-488 contributes 9 more.\n   - Total tens place 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these positions separately and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Here, both 4 and 8 appear once each.\n\nNow, how many such sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481 to 488). So, in each complete set of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this case, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the number of complete tens is 48, and the partial set is 8 numbers. So, in each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 +1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, so in units place, they are equal. So, maybe the difference comes from other places.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred from 401 to 488.\n\nIn each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nIn 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 there.\n\nIn 410-419, tens digit is 1.\n\nSimilarly, 420-429: 2; 430-439:3; 440-449:4; 450-459:5; 460-469:6; 470-479:7; 480-488:8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is part of 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-488, but since 488 is the end, that's 9 numbers: 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding that to the 40 times from the complete hundreds, total for tens place: 4's = 40 +10 =50, 8's = 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's have 1 more here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, 4 and 8 appear once, so 48 times each. In the last 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nIn 401-409: tens digit 0, so no 4 or 8.\n\n410-419: tens digit 1.\n\n420-429:2.\n\n430-439:3.\n\n440-449:4, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4.\n\n450-459:5.\n\n460-469:6.\n\n470-479:7.\n\n480-488:8, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 times 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:10, 8's:9. So, total tens place:4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8's: none, since the hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nSo, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check again. In the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, units place for 8's:48 (complete sets) +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place: same, 49.\n\nIn tens place, 4's have 50, 8's have 49.\n\nHundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, is 488 included in the hundreds place? Yes, 488 is in 400-488, so the hundreds digit is 4, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 appears and 8 appears.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 10\n\nremainder = N % 10\n\ncount = full_cycles * 1\n\nif remainder >= d:\n    count +=1\n\nBut wait, that's for a specific digit. So, for d=4:\n\nfull_cycles = 488 //10 =48\n\nremainder=488%10=8\n\nsince 8 >=4, count=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfull_cycles=48\n\nremainder=8\n\nsince 8>=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: both 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nfull_cycles =488 //100=4\n\nremainder=488%100=88\n\nIn each full cycle of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, count=4*10=40.\n\nNow, remainder is 88, so the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\nWe need to see how many times 4 appears in the tens place in 0-88.\n\nThe tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers, but since the remainder is 88, which is beyond 49, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the partial cycle.\n\nSo, total tens place for 4:40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in tens place:\n\nfull_cycles=4\n\ncount=4*10=40.\n\nRemainder=88, so tens digits go up to 8.\n\nSo, in the partial cycle, 8 appears in the tens place for 80-88, which is 9 numbers (80-88 inclusive). So, 9 times.\n\nThus, total tens place for 8:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nfull_cycles=488 //1000=0\n\nremainder=488\n\nSo, hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 89 times.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nfull_cycles=0\n\nremainder=488\n\nBut hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place:4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that when dealing with digit counting problems, it's helpful to consider each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. In this case, since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to look at each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) for both 4's and 8's and calculate how many times each appears.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in the units place, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nNow, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nBut wait, I have those extra 8 numbers beyond the 480th page. These would be pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here. The units digits for these are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's are 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nLet me calculate how many complete hundreds there are in 488. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), so that's 10 times per hundred. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so that's also 10 times per hundred. So, 4 * 10 = 40 for 8's in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages, from 401 to 488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). I need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4 in the tens place: The tens digit is 4 from 440-449. Wait, but 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: The tens digit is 8 from 480-488. But 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but wait a second, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts: For 4's in tens place, it's 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. For 8's in tens place, it's 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. That means in the tens place, there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. For page numbers 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so we can ignore those. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit starts at 1 and goes up.\n\nIn our case, the book has up to 488 pages, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199: that's 100 numbers, so 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, 2 appears 100 times from 200-299, 3 appears 100 times from 300-399, and 4 appears from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, I'm looking for how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. Since 8 is a higher digit, let's see if any hundreds digit is 8. But the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest is 4. So, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never goes beyond 4.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for each digit place:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations because I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, earlier when I was calculating the units place, I thought both 4's and 8's had 49 each, but let me confirm that.\n\nWait, in the units place, from 1 to 480, each digit appears 48 times, because 480 / 10 = 48. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place (since 4 hundreds, each contributing 10). Then from 401-488, as I calculated earlier, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. And 49 + 49 is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check my math again because 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. And 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought in the tens place, 4's had 50 and 8's had 49, so that's a difference of 1. Then in the hundreds place, 4's have 89 and 8's have 0, so that's a difference of 89. So, overall, the difference would be 1 (from tens) + 89 (from hundreds) = 90. And the units place had equal counts, so no difference there.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. Correct. And 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, I considered 440-449 as 10 numbers where 4 appears in the tens place. That's correct. And 480-488 is 9 numbers where 8 appears in the tens place. So, 9 times. So, adding to the previous counts, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers.\n   - 4's: 48 (from groups) + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 (from groups) + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 pages mean 4 complete hundreds and 88 extra pages.\n   - 4's: 4*10 (from hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 (from hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, right? Like 4, 14, 24, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, and so on.\n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So for the units digit, the number of 4's is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in these extra pages, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total for the units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So in the units place, they are equal. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nHow many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the next hundred (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, then 411-420 is 1, 421-430 is 2, 431-440 is 3, 441-450 is 4, 451-460 is 5, 461-470 is 6, 471-480 is 7, and 481-488 is 8. So in the tens place, 4 appears only once in 441-450. Therefore, the total for the tens place is 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 1 (from the incomplete hundred) = 41 for 4's. For 8's, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so that's 9 times. Therefore, the total for 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 480-488 is 9 pages, so 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481-488 also have 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 times. So 4's in tens place: 41, 8's: 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So for the tens place, 4's are 41 and 8's are 49. So 4's have fewer here, but let's keep going.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFor 4's: From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nFor 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 41\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 41 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 41 is 90, plus 89 is 179.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 4's total is 179 and 8's is 98, so 179 - 98 = 81. But let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4's and 8's. Then in the tens place, 4's had 41 and 8's had 49. In the hundreds place, 4's had 89 and 8's had 0. So adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 41 + 89 = 179\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo the difference is 179 - 98 = 81. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me check the tens place again for 8's. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I had 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units place and 488 has an 8 in units place. So units digits: 48 +1=49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nTens place: For 4's, in the incomplete hundred, 441-450 has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. So 441-450 is within that, right? So that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. But earlier I thought it was 1, which was wrong. Wait, no, because in the tens place, for 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So in the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 times, not 1. So that would make the tens place for 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 41, but that was a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, let me go through the tens place again. Each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So 4 times 10 is 40 for 4's in tens place from complete hundreds. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So when the tens digit is 4, it's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 more for 4's in tens place, making it 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in each complete hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 times 10 = 40. In the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 more, making it 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo correcting the earlier mistake, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times (400-488), and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nSo now, recalculating the totals:\n\n4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's add 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems higher than before. Wait, but let me check again because I think I might have miscalculated the tens place for 4's.\n\nWait, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSo 4's total is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 81, but that was because I had made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. So the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nWait, let's verify the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, there's one 4 in units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4, so 1 more. So 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 full decades with one 8 each, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10. Total: 50.\n\n8's: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. In the incomplete hundred, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total: 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89.\n\n8's: None, as the book ends at 488.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correct? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits or miss any.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by considering each digit position separately and counting the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) and sum them up.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (1 if 4 <= 488%10 else 0). Wait, but that's not exactly accurate. Let me think.\n\nActually, for the units digit, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is:\n\nnumber_of_full_cycles = n // 10\nremainder = n % 10\ncount = number_of_full_cycles * 1\nif d <= remainder:\n    count +=1\n\nSo for 4's in units place:\n\nn = 488\nnumber_of_full_cycles = 488 // 10 = 48\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\nsince 4 <= 8, count = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place:\n\nnumber_of_full_cycles = 48\nremainder = 8\nsince 8 <= 8, count = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nThe formula is similar, but each cycle is 100 numbers, and each cycle contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place.\n\nSo for digit d in tens place:\n\nnumber_of_full_cycles = n // 100\nremainder = n % 100\ncount = number_of_full_cycles * 10\nif d*10 <= remainder:\n    count += (remainder - d*10 + 10)\nelse if d*10 > remainder:\n    count += (remainder - (d*10 - 10) + 1) if (d*10 -10) <= remainder else 0\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many full hundreds, and then the remainder.\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nn = 488\n\nnumber_of_full_cycles = 488 // 100 = 4\nremainder = 488 % 100 = 88\n\nEach full cycle contributes 10 times the digit in tens place, so 4*10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the remainder (0-88), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So 10.\n\nSo total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nnumber_of_full_cycles = 4\nremainder = 88\n\nEach full cycle contributes 10 times 8 in tens place: 4*10=40.\n\nIn the remainder (0-88), 8 appears in the tens place from 80-88, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nOnly numbers from 400-488 have 4 in hundreds place. So that's 89 numbers, as calculated before.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0, since 800 > 488.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but initially I thought 81, but that was due to a miscalculation in the tens place for 4's. So yes, the correct difference is 90.\n\nI think that's solid now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full sets (480 pages) plus 8 extra pages (481-488). In the extra pages, 484 has a 4. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each set of 10 contributes one 8. The extra pages include 488. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages) contributing 40. The remaining 88 pages include 441-450, adding 10. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place. The remaining 88 pages include 480-488, adding 9. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So in the range 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Let me calculate how many such numbers there are. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, 488 itself is 488, so the last group would be 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within 481-488. So, actually, it's 48 times, right? Because 488 is the last page, and 484 is included. Wait, but 488 is 488, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, so 48 times. So, 48 occurrences in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many full groups of 100 we have in 488. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of these hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 40-49, etc.), except maybe the last partial hundred. Wait, 401-488: the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total for tens place: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10 times) plus 10 times in the last partial hundred, so 4*10 + 10 = 50 times? Wait, no, because 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would be 4*10=40, plus 10 in the last part, totaling 50 times. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so 400-488 is the last part. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 4*10 +10=50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, which is 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers, just like 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, but wait, 488 itself ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 480-488. So, each full hundred contributes 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), and the last group contributes 9 times because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many full hundreds are there? Up to 400, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, the last group from 400-488 contributes 9 times (480-488). So, total in tens place is 40 +9=49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check if I counted correctly in each place.\n\nWait, for the units place of 4: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 4, so 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the 481-490 range, 484 is the last one, so that's 48+1=49? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is within 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the units digit 4 appears once in each 10 numbers, so from 1-480, it's 48 times, and then in 481-488, the next 4 would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, maybe I made a mistake earlier by saying 48 times. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears in 4,14,...,484, which is (484-4)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48+1=49 times. So, units place for 4 is 49 times, not 48.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's every 10 numbers, so the number of times is floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so the last occurrence is at 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, the number of times is 48 +1=49? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so the number of times 4 appears in the units place is (488 +1)/10=48.9, but we take the integer part, which is 48, but since 488 is included, and 484 is within 481-490, so actually, it's 49 times.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate it as:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). So, for d=4, n=488.\n\n488//10=48, 488%10=8. Since 8 >=4, so add 1. So, 48+1=49 times. So, units place for 4 is 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, same calculation: 488//10=48, 488%10=8, which is equal to 8, so 48+1=49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's units place was 48, but now it's 49. That changes things. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, so 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's is 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in units place was 48, but now it's 49. So, that affects the total.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place 0, so total 98.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the units place for 4. It should be 49, not 48.\n\nLet me go through each digit again carefully.\n\n**Digit 4:**\n\n- **Units place**: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nUsing the formula: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488%10=8 >=4, add 1. So, 48+1=49.\n\n- **Tens place**: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributes 10 times. So, from 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total tens place:40+10=50.\n\n- **Hundreds place**: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n**Digit 8:**\n\n- **Units place**: Same as above, floor(488/10)=48, 488%10=8>=8, so 48+1=49.\n\n- **Tens place**: How many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400), each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nThus, total tens place for 8:40+9=49.\n\n- **Hundreds place**: As before, 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but after correcting the units place for 4, it's 90.\n\nLet me check again:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n\nI think I made a mistake initially by not correctly calculating the units place for 4, thinking it was 48 instead of 49. So, the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, it appears 49 times (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, and the last occurrence is at 484).\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each (40 times) and 10 times in 440-449, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 8 appears 49 times (similar to 4, as 488 ends with 8).\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each (40 times) and 9 times in 480-488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with whole groups, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages (from 481 to 488). So, in each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives me 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nBut wait, I also have those extra 8 pages. Let me check the units digits in 481 to 488. The units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place, there's one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488). So, adding those, the units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Hmm, so the units place doesn't contribute more 4's than 8's.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for every hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 4's. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4*10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. For 8's, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but since 480 isn't in our range (we start at 401), it's actually 480-488, but 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. Wait, no, 401-488 includes 480-488, so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. But for 4's, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSo, adding up, in the tens place, we have 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 8's. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, right? So, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, because each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 1, 2, 3, 4. There's no page where the hundreds digit is 8 because the book only has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nNow, the total 4's are 188 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 pages. For units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles of 10, and 8 extra pages. In each cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's: 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's appear 89 times (400-488), 8's appear 0 times. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188. Total 8's:49 +49 +0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correct? From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Let's count how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48, remainder 8.\nEach group contributes 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\nRemaining 8 numbers: 481-488. Units digits:1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\nTotal units place: 48+1=49 for 4, 48+1=49 for 8.\n\nTens place:\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(488/100)=4, remainder 88.\nEach group contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\nRemaining 88 numbers: 401-488.\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\nFor 4's in the tens place: from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\nFor 8's in the tens place: from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end), so 9 8's.\nTotal tens place: 40+10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\nNumber of complete groups of 1000: but since we only have 488, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\nSo, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me try a smaller example to check my method.\n\nSuppose the book has 20 pages. How many more 1's than 2's?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 1's:\nUnits place: 1,11 \u2192 2 times\nTens place: 10-19 \u2192 10 times\nTotal 1's:12\nCounting 2's:\nUnits place: 2,12 \u21922 times\nTens place:20 \u21921 time\nTotal 2's:3\nDifference:12-3=9.\n\nWait, but according to my method:\n\nUnits place for 20:\nComplete groups:2, remainder 0.\nEach group contributes 1 1 and 1 2.\nSo, units place:2 1's and 2 2's.\nBut wait, 20/10=2, so 2 groups, each contributing 1, so 2 1's and 2 2's. Since remainder is 0, no extra.\n\nTens place:\nComplete groups of 100:0, remainder 20.\nEach group contributes 10 1's and 10 2's, but since we have 0 groups, 0 each.\nIn the remaining 20, the tens digit is 1 for 10-19 (10 times) and 2 for 20 (1 time).\nSo, tens place:10 1's and 1 2.\n\nHundreds place: 0 for both.\n\nTotal 1's:2 (units) +10 (tens) =12\nTotal 2's:2 (units) +1 (tens)=3\nDifference:9, which matches.\n\nSo, my method works for the smaller example. Therefore, I think my calculation for the 488-page book is correct, resulting in 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but in the smaller example, the difference was 9, which is consistent with the method. So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll need to calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of these positions separately and then add them up for the total count.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, which is 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is within this range, meaning there's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens place has 4's for 10 numbers (40-49). So, for the first 100 pages, that's 10 times. For the next 100 (101-200), another 10 times, and so on up to 400-488. Wait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so the 40-49 block is only up to 488, but 488 is beyond 490, so actually, the 40-49 block in the 400-499 range is present, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect the count? Hmm, no, because 40-49 in the 400-499 range would be 440-449, which is entirely within 488, right? So, that's another 10 times. So, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. So, in each of those 4 hundreds, the tens place has 4's for 10 pages each, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is another 10 times. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 48 full decades plus one more in the last partial decade, so 49. Tens: 4 full hundreds each contributing 10, so 40, plus the 400-499 range contributing another 10, so 50. Hundreds: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many full decades are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades. Each contributes one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89 in each hundred. So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range. So, in each of those 4 hundreds, the tens place has 8's for 10 pages each, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here, not 10, because 480 is the first and 488 is the last, so 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place never has an 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Units: 48 full decades plus 1 in the last, so 49. Tens: 4 full hundreds each with 10, so 40, plus in the 400s, 480-488 gives 9 more, so 49. Hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each (40) plus 9, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 is correct.\n\nI think that's all. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (48 occurrences) + 1 in the last partial decade = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 occurrences) + 10 in the 400-488 range = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (48 occurrences) + 1 in the last partial decade = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 occurrences) + 9 in the 400-488 range = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. In each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times 1 for 4's, which is 48, and 48 times 1 for 8's, which is also 48. \n\nBut then there's the extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in these. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in this partial block, there's one more 4 (in 484) and one more 8 (in 488). So adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's are 48 + 1 = 49 as well.\n\nWait, but that seems like they're equal so far. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so in 484, there's a 4, and in 488, there's an 8. So yes, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), up to 9 (90-99). So each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Then, we have 88 pages after that (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers and 8 for 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Since there are 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining pages from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? That would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, how many times does the tens digit equal 8? That's in 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. When the tens digit is 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous counts, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. The total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, so that means in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n- 48 * 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8.\n- In the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, same for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 each.\n- From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488).\n- So total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is included. So, 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 in 440-449 is 10 numbers: 440 to 449, which is 10 pages.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place, but it seems correct. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In the extra pages, 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages), contributing 40 each.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 440-449: 10 4's\n     - 480-488: 9 8's\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for the digit 8.\n\nNow, how many such blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks of ten and then an extra 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 48*10 + 8, so the last block is 481-488. So, in each of the 48 full blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48*1 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48*1 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in a block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (11-19), 2 (21-29), ..., 9 (91-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears ten times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears ten times in the tens place (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488) will have the tens digit 4 appearing ten times, except the last block which only goes up to 488, so let's check that.\n\nWait, actually, let me correct that. The hundreds blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 401-488. So, in each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears ten times, and the same for 8. But in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in this last block, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is ten times, right? Because 440-449 are pages 440 to 449, so that's ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would be from 480-488, which is nine numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be ten numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's nine numbers. So, in the tens place, for 488 pages, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nLet me think again. For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in 1-100, 40-49: ten times. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149: ten times. 201-300: 240-249: ten times. 301-400: 340-349: ten times. Then, 401-488: 440-449: ten times, and 480-488: nine times for 8 in the tens place. Wait, but in the 401-488 block, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is ten times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is nine times because 489 is beyond 488. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears ten times in each hundred, and in the last hundred, it also appears ten times, so total for 4 in the tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) each contributing ten 4's, and the last 401-488 contributing another ten 4's, so 5*10=50. But wait, 401-488 is part of the fourth hundred, right? Wait, 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-500, but we only go up to 488. So, the 401-488 block is part of the fifth hundred, but it's incomplete. So, in the tens place, 4 appears ten times in each of the first four hundreds (1-400), and then ten times in 401-488, so 4*10 + 10=50 times. Wait, but 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but only up to 488, so does that affect the count? No, because in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is ten times, regardless of the upper limit being 488. So, yes, 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place, let's see. In each hundred, 80-89: ten times. So, in 1-100, 80-89: ten 8's. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189: ten 8's. 201-300: 280-289: ten 8's. 301-400: 380-389: ten 8's. Then, 401-488: 480-488: nine 8's because 489 is beyond 488. So, total for 8 in the tens place: 4*10 + 9=49 times.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50-49=1.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). Wait, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: Each block of ten has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, units digits: 48*1 + 1 (from 484) = 49 for 4, and 48*1 + 1 (from 488) = 49 for 8. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place. So, for 1-400, that's four hundreds, each contributing ten 4's and ten 8's. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (ten times), and the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 (nine times). So, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50, and 8's:4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place would contribute more, but maybe it's correct. Let me think again: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 times. And 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so zero.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Each page number is considered separately, so each digit in each position is counted once. So, for example, page 444 would have three 4's, each counted in their respective place. Similarly, page 488 would have two 8's in the tens and units place, but in our count, we're counting each digit separately, so that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: for each digit position, count how many times 4 and 8 appear. So, units, tens, hundreds. We've done that, so the counts should be accurate.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are four full hundreds (1-400) and a partial block (401-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such sets are there up to 488? Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in 1-100, there's one set (40-49). Then, in 101-200, another set (140-149), and so on. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing one set of ten 4's in the tens place. That's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449, but wait, 440 is beyond 488? Wait, no, 440 is less than 488, so that's another set. Wait, no, 400-499 would be another set, but since we're only going up to 488, the 4 in the tens place occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. 101-200: 140-149 \u2192 10. 201-300: 240-249 \u219210. 301-400: 340-349 \u219210. Then, 401-488: 440-449 \u219210. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50. So yes, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every set of ten has one 8 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Now, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such sets are there up to 488? Let's see, in each hundred, there's one set of ten where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing one set of ten 8's in the tens place. That's 4\u00d710=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 480-489 would be the next set, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 1-100: 80-89 \u219210. 101-200:180-189\u219210. 201-300:280-289\u219210. 301-400:380-389\u219210. Then, 401-488:480-488\u21929. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So 4\u00d710=40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete sets (each contributing 1) +1 in 484 \u219249\n- Tens: 5 sets (each 100 contributing one set of 10) \u21925\u00d710=50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete sets +1 in 488 \u219249\n- Tens: 4 complete sets (each 100) +9 in 480-488 \u219249\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 pages, '4' appears once. There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 '4's. Additionally, in the range 481-488, '4' appears once (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '4' appears in sets like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such sets up to 488 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each set contributes 10 '4's. Total: 5\u00d710=50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 pages. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 pages. 48 complete sets contribute 48 '8's, plus one in 488. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in sets like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete sets, contributing 40 '8's, plus 9 in 480-488. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last set goes up to 488, so in the units place, we have 48 fours from the complete sets and then we need to check if the last partial set (481-488) has a 4 in the units place. 484 would be the next number with a 4 in the units place, but 484 is within 488, so that's another 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. So that's 10 fours. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, we have the last partial hundred from 400-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48 eights. Now, the last partial set is 481-488. The number 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds in 488, so 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 more eights. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 complete sets (48) + 484 (1 more) = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds *10 =40, plus 440-449 (10) =50\n- Hundreds: 400-488 (89)\nTotal: 49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 + 488 (1) =49\n- Tens: 4*10=40, plus 480-488 (9) =49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488.\n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, right? Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place every ten numbers.\n\nSo, how many complete groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the complete groups, plus one more time in the last partial group (since 481 would have a 4 in the units place). Wait, actually, the last partial group is 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in this partial group (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Hmm, so in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times. Interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly ten times in every hundred numbers. For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, which is ten times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is also ten times.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so that's also 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens place, we need to check if 4 and 8 appear.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is ten numbers, but wait, in the last partial hundred, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is within that range. So, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is ten times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is nine times because 480-488 is nine numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, from 480 to 488 inclusive, that's nine numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, the digit 8 appears nine times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490). But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 is from 480 to 488. Wait, but 480 is actually in the 480-489 range, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is nine numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears nine times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. The digit 8 appears 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That means 4 appears one more time than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. From 200-299, it's 2, appearing 100 times. From 300-399, it's 3, appearing 100 times. From 400-488, it's 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). \n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit position.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because when I added up, I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate the totals.\n\nFor 4:\nUnits: 49\nTens: 50\nHundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nFor 8:\nUnits: 49\nTens: 49\nHundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 98 from 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each group of ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- There are 48 complete groups of ten in 480 pages, so 48 each for 4 and 8.\n- Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total: 48 +1 =49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n- There are four complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 each.\n- In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is ten times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is nine times. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 times (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, so according to this, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the hundreds digit for 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the last partial hundred, 480-488 is nine numbers, so the tens digit is 8 nine times, which I counted as 49 in total for 8's tens place. Wait, but 40 in the complete hundreds plus 9 in the last partial hundred gives 49, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each position again to confirm.\n\nCalculating 4's:\n\nUnits place:\n- For every 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place.\n- 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n- Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484).\n- Total units: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- For every 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49).\n- 488 /100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40.\n- In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n- The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- So, total tens: 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nCalculating 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n- Same as 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48.\n- In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n- For every 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n- 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40.\n- In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is nine times (480-488).\n- So, total tens: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place in this book.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each to '4' and '8'.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more occurrence each for '4' (484) and '8' (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 for '4' and 49 for '8'.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - In every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and '8' appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89).\n   - For 400 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 each to '4' and '8'.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 for '4' and 49 for '8'.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 for '4' and 0 for '8'.\n\n4. **Total Occurrences:**\n   - **For '4':** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **For '8':** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I should probably look at the digits in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place separately.\n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each position and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4. So, I can divide 488 by 10 to get the number of times 4 appears in the units place. That would be 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, I'll take the integer part, which is 48 times. Wait, but actually, from 1 to 488, the last block is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 4 in the units place appears 48 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so it's 48 complete cycles (since 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens). So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the block where the tens digit is 4, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The next is 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check: from 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5\u00d710=50. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? Again, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. Wait, but let's check: the last number is 488, which ends with 8, so that's the 49th occurrence in the units place. Because 488 is included, so it's 49 times. Wait, because from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 eights in the units place, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once more at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many full blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 + 1 = 9)\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\n- The first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 eights, so 4\u00d710=40.\n- The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 eights in the tens place (since each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place).\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the block 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units and tens places for 8.\n\nFor units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, plus one more at 488, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place: as I thought, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4\u00d710=40 plus 9=49. That adds up.\n\nNow, comparing the totals:\n\nNumber of 4's: 187\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, I had 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 49, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me recount the 8's in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? They are 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many terms are there? The first term is 8, the last term is 488, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, yes, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as above, 49 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98 for 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits: 48 times (since 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full times, but wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times.\n\nTens: 50 times (as there are 5 blocks of 10 where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50).\n\nHundreds: 89 times.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the 4's in the units place? From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? They are 4,14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is the 48th term because 484 = 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2192 n = (484 -4)/10 +1= 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, that's 49 terms. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the units place for 4.\n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 is the units digit, which is every 10 numbers. So, the first is 4, then 14, 24,..., up to 484.\n\nSo, the number of terms is ((484 -4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times, not 48. I think I made a mistake earlier by not including the 484 as the 49th term. So, units place for 4 is 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's also 49 times, as we saw.\n\nSo, correcting that, the total number of 4's is:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 50 (from 40-49,140-149, etc.)\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by miscalculating the units place for 4's. It's actually 49 times, not 48.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: numbers ending with 4 from 1 to 488.\n\nFirst term:4, last term:484.\n\nNumber of terms: ((484 -4)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, same calculation:49 times.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me check again.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49\n\nTens place for 4's:5 blocks of 10, each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nUnits place for 8's:49\n\nTens place for 8's:4 full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40\n\nPlus the partial block 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9.\n\nTotal tens place for 8's:40+9=49\n\nHundreds place for 8's:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, in the number 484, does it have both a 4 in the units and hundreds place? Yes, but each digit is counted separately, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 488 has an 8 in the units and tens place, but each is counted separately.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks (40 occurrences) and a partial block 480-488 (9 occurrences), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place up to 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488.\n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll have to calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of these positions separately and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digits in the units place are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of the 48 complete sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 occurrences of 4 and 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place. \n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages after the 480th page, which are 481 to 488. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these extra pages, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, we have a total of 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. Hmm, so for the units place, the counts are equal. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 again, but only up to 88. Let's break it down:\n\n- From 401-410: tens digit is 0 (401-410), so no 4 or 8 in the tens place.\n- From 411-420: tens digit is 1, same thing.\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2.\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3.\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4. Here, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5.\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6.\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7.\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8. Here, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nWait, let me check that. From 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but there are only 8 numbers here (481 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. The difference here is 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, where the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each of these digits appears 100 times in the hundreds place for each hundred. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist or is 0, so we can ignore that.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAs for the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +2\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each.\n- Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units: 48 +1 =49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights. Difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n- 488 / 100 =4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, so 40 each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0-8 in the tens place.\n- From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, but only up to 88 pages.\n- So, for the tens digit:\n  - 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n  - 8 appears in 480-488, which is 8 times (since 488 is the last page).\n- So, total tens:\n  - 4's: 40 +10=50\n  - 8's:40 +8=48\n- Difference: 50-48=2\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (488-400+1=89).\n- So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n- So, 8's:0\n- Difference:89-0=89\n\nAdding up the differences:\n\n- Units:0\n- Tens:+2\n- Hundreds:+89\n- Total:0+2+89=91\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I added up the differences, I did 2 (from tens) +89 (from hundreds) =91. So, the total number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. For example, in page 444, the digit 4 appears three times, but I think I counted each occurrence separately in units, tens, and hundreds. So, that's correct because each digit's position is considered separately.\n\nWait, but let me check if I accounted for all the 4's and 8's correctly.\n\nLet me try a different approach: calculate total 4's and total 8's separately.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\n- Total:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\n- Total:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that matches. So, the number of 4's is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Determine the Range of Page Numbers:**\n   - Pages are numbered from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences of Digits in Each Position:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Number of complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n     - Each set contributes 1 '4' and 1 '8' in the units place.\n     - Total from complete sets: 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n     - Remaining pages (481-488): units digits include 4 and 8 once each.\n     - Total units place: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n     - Complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 sets.\n     - Each set contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n     - Total from complete sets: 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n     - Remaining pages (401-488):\n       - '4' appears 10 times (440-449).\n       - '8' appears 8 times (480-488).\n     - Total tens place: 50 '4's and 48 '8's.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 1-399: hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3; no '4' or '8'.\n     - Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - Total hundreds place: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n3. **Sum the Occurrences:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total '4's - Total '8's = 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{91}."

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, the units place. In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times. But wait, the extra 8 pages go from 481 to 488, and in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (from 400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Let me check that again. From 1-488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the tens digit being 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. So, yes, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nWait, units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digit 4 appears once (484). So, units total is 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, checking each digit place.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, units total is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, since the book ends at 488, 380-389 is included, but 480-489 would be beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, how many such blocks? Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last block, 380-389, that's within 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, tens place 8's: 40.\n\nWait, but wait, from 400-488, the tens digit could also be 8 in 480-488, right? So, that's another 9 numbers (480-488). So, actually, in the tens place, 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm getting 49. Let me clarify. Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, for hundreds 0,1,2,3, each contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 in total.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check units and tens again. Units place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, units total is 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: As above, 49. So total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 49, and tens place 49, so total 98. So, 98 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. Earlier, I thought there were five blocks where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488, which adds 1 more, so 49.\n\nSo, yes, 98 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups and 8 remaining numbers.

So 4 appears once more in the units place. So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that. When I have 488 pages, the last page is 488, so the last group is 481 to 488. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in the units place here. So yes, 48 +1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in the 140-149 range, and 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block for 440-449 is complete, but the next block would be 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, not 4. So let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach hundred block (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a 40-49 block where the tens digit is 4. So for each hundred, that's 10 times. Now, how many full hundreds are there? From 1-488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred block, but we only go up to 488. So in each of the first four hundreds, the 40-49 block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit from 400-409 is 0, but from 410-419, it's 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit in the 400-488 range for the tens place would be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). Wait, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 +10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400-488, so 400-488 is 89 pages. The 440-449 block is within that, so that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So yes, 40 from the first four hundreds and 10 from 440-449, totaling 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 +50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (since 48*10=480) and 8 remaining numbers (481-488). So in each group of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So 48 times 1 is 48. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once more. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For 8 in the tens place, it appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So each hundred block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many full hundreds are there? From 1-488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the 80-89 block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So that's 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total 8's in the tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 8's. So 40 (from the first four hundreds) +9=49. So 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So the difference is 188-98=90. So 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then in 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the 40-49 block contributes 10 4's. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, the 440-449 block contributes another 10. So 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then in 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each of the first four hundreds, 80-89 contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9 8's. So 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 9 8's in the tens place. So 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 400-488 range for 8's in the tens place. 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nSo yeah, I think the calculations are correct. So the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I should recount for 4's in the units place. Let me see: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So 49 times, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 has 8 in the units place. So how many terms? The first term is 8, last term is 488. The nth term is 8 +10*(n-1)=488. So 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So 49 times, which matches.\n\nFor the tens place, 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, and in 440-449, another 10, so 50.\n\n8's in the tens place: in each of the first four hundreds, 10 times, so 40, and in 480-488, 9 times, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's: 89 times, 8's: 0.\n\nSo yeah, 188-98=90.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 +1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 4's. There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-449). So, 5*10=50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 +1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 8's. There are 4 such blocks in the first 400 numbers. In 400-488, 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, 4*10 +9=49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 +49 =98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) -98 (8's) =90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4); from 11-20, it appears once (at 14), and so on.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, let me calculate the total number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: There are 488 pages, so how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 '4' in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\n- Tens place: For the tens place, each block of 100 numbers has 10 '4's in the tens place. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 '4's. So, 4*10=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) are part of the next block. In the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, in the tens place, how many '4's are there? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more '4's. So, total tens place '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: As calculated earlier, 89 '4's.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, the hundreds place only goes up to 488, so from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding them up: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total '4's: 187.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, I considered 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 '4's, so 40, and then in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\nSimilarly, I'll count the number of '8's in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. Units place: Same logic as '4's. Each block of 10 numbers has one '8' in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48 complete blocks, contributing 48 '8's. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 is present once (at 488). So, units place '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 '8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, 4 blocks of 100 contribute 4*10=40 '8's. Now, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have the tens digits from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So, how many '8's in the tens place? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, total tens place '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for each, so 9 '8's. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no '8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place '8's: 0.\n\nSo, total '8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the units place, from 1-488, how many '8's? Each block of 10 has one '8', so 48 full blocks, 48 '8's, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 is present once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place, each block of 100 has 10 '8's, so 4 blocks give 40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of '4's is 187, and the number of '8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the '4's. Let me go through it again.\n\nFor '4's:\n\n- Units place: 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 '4', so 48. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a '4' in the units place, so total 48.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 '4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more '4's. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n\nAdding up: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor '8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks of 10, 48 '8's, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 100, 40 '8's, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for '4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 = 88, so plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 '4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe using a formula or another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can write out the counts for smaller numbers to see if my method works.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller number, say 48 pages.\n\nHow many '4's and '8's would there be?\n\nUnits place: 4 and 14, so 2 '4's, and 8 and 18, so 2 '8's.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but since we only go up to 48, that's 9 numbers (40-48), so 9 '4's in the tens place. For '8's, the tens place is 80-88, but since we only go up to 48, there are no '8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: none, since 48 is less than 100.\n\nSo, total '4's: units (2) + tens (9) = 11.\n\nTotal '8's: units (2) + tens (0) = 2.\n\nDifference: 11 - 2 = 9.\n\nWait, but let me count manually:\n\nPages 1-48:\n\n'4's: 4,14,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48. Wait, that's 11 '4's.\n\n'8's: 8,18,48. So, 3 '8's.\n\nWait, so according to my earlier method, units place '4's: 4 and 14, so 2.\n\nTens place '4's: 40-48, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '4's. So total '4's: 11.\n\nUnits place '8's: 8,18,28,38,48. Wait, that's 5 '8's, not 2. Wait, so my earlier method was wrong for '8's in units place.\n\nWait, in 48 pages, the units '8's are 8,18,28,38,48: that's 5 '8's, not 2. So, my initial approach was incorrect. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see. When I was calculating '8's in the units place, I thought that each block of 10 contributes one '8', but in reality, in the first block (1-10), '8' is at 8, so that's 1. Then, in the next block (11-20), '8' is at 18, another 1. Similarly, up to 48, which is the fifth block (41-50), but since we only go up to 48, it's 48. So, in each block of 10, there's one '8' in the units place, except possibly the last block if it's incomplete.\n\nIn the case of 48 pages, there are 5 blocks of 10 (1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-48). So, each block contributes one '8', except the last block, which is incomplete but still includes 48. So, total '8's in units place: 5.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, '8's are in 80-89, but since we only go up to 48, there are none. So, total '8's: 5.\n\nSo, in my earlier method, I had for units place: 48 pages, so 4 full blocks (1-40) and then 8 remaining pages (41-48). So, units '8's: 4*1=4, plus in the last 8 pages, units digits go up to 8, so 48 has an '8', so 1 more, total 5. That matches.\n\nSo, my initial method was correct for '8's in units place when I considered the remainder. So, in the case of 488 pages, for '8's in units place: 488 /10=48 full blocks, each contributing 1 '8', so 48. The last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so '8' appears once at 488, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for '8's in the tens place: Each block of 100 contributes 10 '8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) contribute 40 '8's. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the smaller case of 48 pages, using the same method:\n\nUnits '8's: 4 full blocks (1-40), 4 '8's, plus 1 in 41-48, total 5.\n\nTens '8's: 0, since 48 < 80.\n\nSo, total '8's: 5, which matches.\n\nTherefore, my method seems correct.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, the number of '4's is 187, and '8's is 98, so the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check once more for '4's in the tens place. From 1-488, how many times does '4' appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each block of 100, '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 100 contribute 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is '4' only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 '4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 '4', so 48. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't have a '4' in the units place, so total 48.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 '4's.\n\nSo, total '4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n'8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 187, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how digits are counted in numbers. For each digit place\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position. \n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. For every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Looking at 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's a 4 in 484. That adds one more 4, making the total 4's in the units place 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, each set of 10 has one 8, so 48 times 1 is 48, and in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears in 488. So that's one more, making it 49 8's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the units digit is 8. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's occur 49 times each. Hmm, that's interesting. So, so far, in the units place, they are tied at 49 each.\n\nNext, I should check the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place from the complete hundreds. Now, for the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410, but wait, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, but actually, 401-410 would have tens digit 0? Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, so tens digit is 0. Then 411-420 would have tens digit 1, and so on. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each having 10 numbers) and 8 extra numbers. Wait, actually, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, which is 88 numbers. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). \n\nWait, let me correct that. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go as follows: 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times because 481-488 is 8 numbers. Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times, while the others from 0 to 7 appear 10 times each.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times, but in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go up to 8, but only 8 numbers for the last tens digit. So, for the tens digit 4 in 401-488, how many times does it appear? It's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so that's 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the incomplete hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, in the tens place overall, the total number of 4's is 4 (from the complete hundreds) times 10, which is 40, plus 10 from the incomplete hundred, making it 50. For 8's, it's 4 times 10 (40) plus 8 from the incomplete hundred, making it 48.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, etc., up to 301-400, which is 4 complete hundreds. Each of these has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's occur 50 times, and 8's occur 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4.\n\nSo, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 in this book, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's tally up all the digits.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97\n\nNow, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- Each 10 numbers contribute 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for 4, and 48+1=49 for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. For 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n- So, total tens place: 40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a sequence of numbers. So, for every 10 numbers, each digit appears once in the units place. But since our book ends at 488, I need to see how many complete groups of 10 there are and if there's a partial group.\n\nWait, but 488 is not a multiple of 10, so the last group will have 8 numbers. Let me calculate the total number of units digits first.\n\nTotal units digits: For each 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, the units digit cycles 48 times and then 8 more.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in units place: 48 times (once every 10 numbers) plus 1 more if the last partial group includes a 4. Wait, 481-488: the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's a 4 in 484. So, that's one more. So total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in units place: 48 times, plus in the last partial group, 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So, total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting. So, so far, they're tied.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers, 1 for 10, and so on up to 9 for 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digits cycle again, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds do we have in 488? Well, 488 is in the 4th hundred, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the total number of hundreds is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 4th hundred, but it's only 88 numbers. So, the tens digit cycles normally for the first 400 pages, and then from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 again, but only up to 88.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all pages.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 400 pages (1-400), there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, for digits 4 and 8, each appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see how many numbers are in each tens group.\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0 (but actually, 401-410 would be tens digit 0, but wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages. So, the tens digits from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is only 8 numbers.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 401-488, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place: in 401-488, it's 10 times (441-450). So, total tens 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: in 1-400, it's 40 times. In 401-488, it's 8 times (481-488). So, total tens 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 is ahead by 2 so far.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds digit:\n\n- 1-99: 0 hundreds digits, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so for each page from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 8: Well, in the range 800-899, the hundreds digit is 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total hundreds digit 4's: 89\nTotal hundreds digit 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's in units place? Every 10 numbers, one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, one more 4, making it 49. Similarly, for 8's: 48 full tens, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8. For digit 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 for 4. For 8, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more. So, total 40 + 8 = 48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but let me check again. When calculating the tens place from 401-488, I considered that for 4, it's 10 times, but for 8, it's 8 times. That seems correct because 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the tens digit in 401-488, each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times because we only go up to 488.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times, and for 8, it's 8 times.\n\nSo, that part checks out.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, only 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, the total counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91, meaning there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't miss any other digit positions or cases. We considered units, tens, and hundreds places separately, making sure to account for the partial group in the last hundred. It all adds up correctly, so I'm confident the answer is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups (480 pages) with 8 remaining pages (481-488).\n   - **'4's in units place:** 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **'8's in units place:** 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers in the tens place.\n   - For 1-400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit.\n     - **'4's:** 4 * 10 = 40.\n     - **'8's:** 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - **'4's:** Appear in 441-450 (10 times).\n     - **'8's:** Appear in 481-488 (8 times).\n   - **Total '4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Total '8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 pages.\n   - **'4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **'8's in hundreds place:** 0 (since the book ends at 488).\n\n4. **Summing Up All Occurrences:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place in each set of ten. But wait, since the book goes up to 488, I need to make sure I account for the last set which might not be complete.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the total number of complete tens times 1, plus any extra in the last partial set. Similarly for 8's. Let's calculate the number of complete tens in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete tens and then 8 extra pages. In each complete ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the count for 4's would be 48 * 1 = 48, and the same for 8's. Now, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does the digit 4 appear in the units place? Yes, at 484. Similarly, 8 appears at 488. So, that adds 1 more 4 and 1 more 8. Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, units digits from 481-488 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 is included, which adds a 4, and 488 adds an 8. So yes, both get an extra 1, making it 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 40 times for 8's in the tens place. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Let's break this down:\n\n- Pages 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages (441-450). Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages (481-488). Wait, but 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10. Hmm, so in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are more by 50 - 48 = 2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the last 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 441-450, which is 10 pages, correct. And when the tens digit is 8, it's from 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, yes, 10 and 8 respectively. So, 4's get an extra 10, 8's get an extra 8.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48. So, 4's are ahead by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, right? So, let's see how many times each hundreds digit appears.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit numbers), but wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, so maybe I should consider it as 01? Hmm, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the hundreds digit 8? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, 8's are 0. So, 4's are ahead by 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 complete tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, last 8 pages (481-488) have 484, which is a 4, and 488, which is an 8. So, units place: 48 +1 =49, 8's:48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, last 88 pages: 441-450 is 10 4's, and 481-488 is 8 8's. So, 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but I feel like 91 is a big number. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nAnother way: Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: As before, 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:48.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: 488-400+1=89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnd 8's in hundreds place: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 91.\n\nWait, but let me think if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. No, because 800 would be page 800, but the book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the final answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of one hundred pages contains ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 and 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds in 488 pages, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) include 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, contributing 89 4's.\n   - No page number in 1-488 has an 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"
