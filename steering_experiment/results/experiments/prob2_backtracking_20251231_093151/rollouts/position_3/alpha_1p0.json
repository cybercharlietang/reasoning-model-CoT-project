    "text": " Let me think about the different positions where the digits 4 and 8 can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Maybe I should handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8 and then compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in the units place, right? So, for every 10 pages, each digit appears once. But wait, in this case, the book has 488 pages, so let me see how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 also appears 48 times. But wait, there are 8 extra pages beyond 480, so pages 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so in the units place, 8 appears once more, making it 49 times for 8 and 48 times for 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. For the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears the same number of times in each set of 10 pages. So, for 488 pages, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears 0 times and 8 appears 1 time. So total for units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but actually, when you have 488 pages, it's 48 full tens and then 8 more. So for units digit, 4 appears 48 times (once every 10 pages), and 8 appears 48 times plus once in the last 8 pages, so 49 times. So, units place: 4's count is 48, 8's count is 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.) and then 88 pages into the fifth hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for 4 full hundreds, each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits from 481-488 are 8. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages?\n\nWait, let me list the tens digits in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 times)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 times)\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2 (10 times)\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3 (10 times)\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 times)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5 (10 times)\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6 (10 times)\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7 (10 times)\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 times, since only 8 pages: 481-488)\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, that's 8 pages. So in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and the digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 4*10 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 times in 441-450, so 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- 8 appears 4*10 (from the first 400 pages) plus 8 times in 481-488, so 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the first 400 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each of these occurs a certain number of times. Specifically, 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. So, for 4 in the tens place: 40 (from first 400) + 10 = 50. For 8 in the tens place: 40 (from first 400) + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so I subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) add an extra 8 in the units place, making 8's count 49 and 4's count 48. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- First 400 pages: 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n- Remaining 88 pages: 441-450 adds 10 times for 4 in the tens place, and 481-488 adds 8 times for 8 in the tens place.\nSo, 4's tens count: 40 + 10 = 50\n8's tens count: 40 + 8 = 48\nThat looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times\nThat's correct.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages = 48 full groups of 10, so 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 8 in the units place.\n   - Total: 4's = 48, 8's = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - 488 pages = 4 full hundreds, so each digit appears 40 times.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 441-450: 10 times for 4.\n     - 481-488: 8 times for 8.\n   - Total: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 times for 4.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 97 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be from 1 to 488, which means the digits can be one, two, or three digits long. But maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 more pages. So, in each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. But wait, in the incomplete block of 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total in units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, we have 88 pages remaining beyond the 400th page. Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds (400) plus 88 pages, so the tens digit in the 400s goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8 in 480-488). So, let's break it down.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). Wait, but each of these is 10 pages except the last one, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, for the tens digit in the 400s:\n\n- 0 appears 10 times (400-409)\n- 1 appears 10 times (410-419)\n- 2 appears 10 times (420-429)\n- 3 appears 10 times (430-439)\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 5 appears 10 times (450-459)\n- 6 appears 10 times (460-469)\n- 7 appears 10 times (470-479)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, not 10. So, in the tens place for the 400s, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, in the 400s, the tens digit contributes 10 fours and 9 eights. Now, before the 400s, we had 1-399. Let me check if I'm correct in considering that each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. For example, in 1-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. Similarly, in 100-199, the tens digit again cycles 0-9 ten times each, so another 10 fours and 10 eights. The same applies to 200-299 and 300-399. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Then, in the 400s, as we saw, 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total in the tens place: fours = 40 + 10 = 50, eights = 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, fours are 50, eights are 49.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards. So, for 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nNow, we're looking for how many 4's and 8's appear in the hundreds place. So, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of fours printed is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 48 +1 =49, same for 8.\n\nTens place: For each hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4 hundreds would give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, with 8 appearing only 9 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +9=49 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears.\n\nSo, adding up: fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488-400+1 is 89, which is correct. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 four (484) and 1 eight (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For the first 400 pages, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 fours; same for eights.\n   - From 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, with 8 appearing 9 times.\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference**: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, no, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the highest is a three-digit number. But actually, 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should think in terms of units, tens, and hundreds place separately. That makes sense because each digit place can be analyzed independently for the occurrence of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll consider 48 full groups and then the remaining 8 pages. \n\nIn each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so in the units place, they are equal? That's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so we have 4 full hundreds and then 88 pages. \n\nIn each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages, which go from 400 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit in this range. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears from 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages (since 488 is included). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Because 480 has 8 in the tens place, 481 has 8, up to 488. So that's 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me check: from 400-409, tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; ...; 430-439, it's 3; 440-449, it's 4; then 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, and 480-488 is 8. So in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, adding that to the previous 400, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Similarly, 8's in the tens place are 4*10 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 300-399 is hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but since the book only goes up to 488, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor the units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\n\nFor the tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference: +1.\n\nFor the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units digit. There are 48 full groups (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488). In the extra 8 pages, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 48*1 +1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. 4 hundreds, so 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is included). So, 40 +10 =50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again because sometimes when you break it down, you might miscount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\nUnits place: As before, 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, up to 8 for 480-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to calculate the tens place in the remaining 88 pages is to note that from 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8. But 488 is the 88th page after 400, so 400-488 is 89 pages. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating it, but I think my earlier calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a formula for digit frequency. The number of times a digit d appears in a specific place in numbers from 1 to n can be calculated with a formula, but I might not remember it exactly, so perhaps it's safer to proceed as I did before.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 each.\n\nRemaining numbers:488 - 48*10=8 numbers:481-488.\n\nIn these, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units:48+1=49, same for 8's:49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, in 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, so the tens digit in 400-488: from 0 to 8.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times because 488 is the last number.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. The tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\n8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 40 (from the first 400) +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 or 1, but since we're starting from page 1, maybe 1-99 have hundreds digit 0 or 1? Wait, no, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so page 1 is just 1, not 001. So, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full groups (480 pages) give 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (400 pages) give 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (400-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let's see, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. So, I might need to count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). Here, the only digits are from 1 to 9, so each digit appears exactly once. That means there's one 4 and one 8 in this range. So, 4's:1, 8's:1. The difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Now, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, 4 can appear in the tens place from 40 to 49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 can appear in the tens place from 80 to 89, also 10 times. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers, 4 can appear once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times because from 10 to 99, there are 9 sets of ten. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99), so each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place per decade. But for 4, it's from 10 to 99, so 14,24,...,94, which is 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 18,28,...,98, which is also 9 times. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here, so 44 would contribute one 4 in the units place, right? So, actually, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but when considering two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, each digit in the units place from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times because there are 9 decades. So, for 4, it's 9 times, same for 8. So, in the units place, 4's:9, 8's:9.\n\nSo, combining tens and units places for two-digit numbers: 4's total is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, 8's total is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, in two-digit numbers, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I'm counting the units place, do I include 40-49? Because in 40-49, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 40 has 0, 41 has 1, up to 49. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each set of ten, so yes, 9 times in total for two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but 44 is counted in both tens and units places, but each occurrence is separate. So, in the tens place, 44 is counted as a 4 in the tens, and in the units place, it's another 4. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. So, the pages here are from 100 up to 488. Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, and 400-488:4.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 100-488, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. But we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit pages up to 488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit =1 (100-199):\n   - Tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred.\n   - So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n   - But wait, 100-199 is 100 pages, so for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds digit =2 (200-299):\n   - Same logic as above. Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (240-249), 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n3. Hundreds digit =3 (300-399):\n   - Similarly, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n4. Hundreds digit =4 (400-488):\n   - Now, here, the tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, for tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 4 appears 10 times.\n   - For tens digit 8: 480-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds digits:\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n- 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) +10 (hundreds=3) +10 (hundreds=4) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but in hundreds=4, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 40 times total for 4's in tens place.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n- 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2) +10 (hundreds=3) +9 (hundreds=4) = 39 times.\n\nWait, because in hundreds=4, tens digit 8 goes up to 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:40, 8's:39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's consider each hundreds group.\n\n1. Hundreds digit=1 (100-199):\n   - For each tens group (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9.\n   - So, for each tens group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once.\n   - There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds digit=2 (200-299):\n   - Same as above. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds digit=3 (300-399):\n   - Same. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds digit=4 (400-488):\n   - Now, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so 9 tens groups.\n   - For each tens group, the units digit cycles 0-9, but we have to check if the page number is within 488.\n   - For tens digits 0-8:\n     - For tens=0: 400-409: units digits 0-9. So, 404 has a 4, and 408 has an 8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n     - Similarly, for tens=1: 410-419: 414 and 418, so 4 and 8 each once.\n     - This continues up to tens=7: 470-479: 474 and 478.\n     - For tens=8: 480-488: units digits 0-8. So, 484 has a 4, but 488 is the last page, so 488 has an 8, but 489 would be beyond. So, in units place, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, for each tens group in hundreds=4, whether tens=0 to 8, each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except maybe when the units digit goes beyond 8, but in this case, since the last page is 488, the units digit only goes up to 8 in the last tens group. So, for each of the 9 tens groups, 4 appears once, so 9 times, and 8 appears once, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: in the hundreds=4 group, from 400 to 488, how many tens groups are there? From 400-409 (tens=0), 410-419 (tens=1), ..., 480-488 (tens=8). So, that's 9 tens groups. Each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 9 times each.\n\nSo, units place in hundreds=4: 4's:9, 8's:9.\n\nNow, adding up across all hundreds:\n\nFor 4's in units place:\n- 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2) +10 (hundreds=3) +9 (hundreds=4) = 39 times.\n\nFor 8's in units place:\n- 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2) +10 (hundreds=3) +9 (hundreds=4) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second. In the hundreds=4 group, the units digit for 8 is present in 488, which is within the range, so yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the units place, 4's:39, 8's:39.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Hundreds place:89\n- Tens place:40\n- Units place:39\nTotal 4's:89 +40 +39 =168\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds place:0\n- Tens place:39\n- Units place:39\nTotal 8's:0 +39 +39=78\n\nWait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the tens place for 8's in three-digit numbers again.\n\nEarlier, I thought that in the tens place for 8's, across all hundreds, it was 39. Let me verify that.\n\nFor hundreds=1,2,3: each contributes 10 times in the tens place for 8's, so 3*10=30.\n\nFor hundreds=4: tens digit=8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place:30 +9=39, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 8's:10+10+10+9=39, correct.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:39(tens)+39(units)=78.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds place for 8's is zero, correct, because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, single-digit pages (1-9):\n- 4's:1\n- 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n- 4's:19\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n- 4's:168\n- 8's:78\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, let me double-check the counts, because 90 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nLet me go through the three-digit counts again.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Hundreds=1,2,3: each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in tens place.\n- Hundreds=4: tens=4 contributes 10 4's (440-449), and tens=8 contributes 9 8's (480-488). So, 4's in tens place:3*10 +10=40. 8's in tens place:3*10 +9=39.\n\nUnits place:\n- Hundreds=1,2,3: each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in units place.\n- Hundreds=4: contributes 9 4's and 9 8's in units place (since tens=0-8, 9 groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place).\n\nSo, 4's in units place:3*10 +9=39\n\n8's in units place:3*10 +9=39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit:0+39+39=78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4's:1+19+168=188\n\n8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the three-digit numbers?\n\nWait, for the hundreds=4, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nIn the units place, for hundreds=4, each tens group (0-8) contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 9 times each.\n\nSo, yes, 4's in units:9, 8's in units:9.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit:89+40+39=168\n\n8's in three-digit:39+39=78\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the two-digit counts again.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 40-49:10 4's, 80-89:10 8's\n\nUnits place:14,24,...,94:9 4's, 18,28,...,98:9 8's\n\nSo, 4's:10+9=19\n\n8's:10+9=19\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSingle-digit:1 each.\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers.\n\n**Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n- 4 appears once.\n- 8 appears once.\n\n**Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), and 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n- Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n- Total 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n**Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- **Tens place:** \n  - 4 appears 10 times in each of the hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 10 times in 400-449, totaling 40 times.\n  - 8 appears 10 times in each of the hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 9 times in 480-488, totaling 39 times.\n- **Units place:** \n  - 4 appears 10 times in each of the hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n  - 8 appears 10 times in each of the hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n- Total 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n- Total 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n**Total occurrences:**\n- **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places\u2014separately. That might make it easier to compare them.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right?\n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so the last set might not be complete. Let me check how many complete sets of ten there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). In each complete set of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and total 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place. That means the difference so far is zero.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's break this down:\n\nFrom 401-409: Tens digit is 0.\nFrom 410-419: Tens digit is 1.\n...\nFrom 440-449: Tens digit is 4. So, here, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\nSimilarly, from 480-488: Tens digit is 8. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times here because the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, from 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the partial block.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit in 480 is 8, and from 480 to 488, the tens digit remains 8 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 480 to 488 inclusive? That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 of these. So, in the partial block, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 440-449). So, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4's are 4*10 + 10 = 50, and 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear once more than 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0.\n\nAdding it all up:\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recalculate the hundreds place. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, in the tens place, 4's are 10 and 8's are 9. So, in the partial block, 4's in tens place are 10, 8's are 9.\n\nSo, in the tens place overall: 4's = 4*10 + 10 = 50, 8's = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 48 full sets (each contributing 1) + 1 in the partial set (484) = 49\nSimilarly, 8's = 48 + 1 (488) = 49\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is calculated by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the count for 8 is done. After summing up the occurrences in each place, we find that there are 188 fours and 98 eights. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each range one by one. \n\nFirst, for single-digit pages (1-9), the only page with a 4 is page 4. So that's one 4. No 8's in this range because the single-digit numbers don't go up to 8 beyond page 8, but since I'm only looking for 4's and 8's, I can note that page 8 is an 8, but I'll get to that when I count the 8's.\n\nMoving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let's consider the tens place first. The tens digit can be 1-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So that's 10 4's in the tens place. \n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear? It should be once in every ten numbers. So, in 10-19, it's 14; in 20-29, it's 24; and so on up to 90-99, which is 94. That's 9 instances, right? Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, there are 9 decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 9 4's in the units place. \n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, total 4's are 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's. \n\nWait, but hold on, from 40-49, the units digit goes from 0-9, so that's 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place, which is correct. And for the units digit, from 10-99, each ten has one number ending with 4, so 9 times, right? Because 10-19 has 14, 20-29 has 24, ..., 90-99 has 94. So that's 9 numbers. So 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's check three-digit pages, which are from 100-488. Here, each page number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; and 400-488 is 4. \n\nNow, for the hundreds place, how many 4's are there? Well, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1-4. Let's consider each hundreds group separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 140-149, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): The tens digit 4 appears from 240-249, another 10 numbers. So another 10 4's.\n\nSame for hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 340-349, 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, but wait, does 449 exceed 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So that's another 10 numbers, 440-449, contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is the last page. So, does 449 come after 488? No, 449 is before 488. So, yes, 440-449 are all valid. So that's 10 more 4's in the tens place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all hundreds digits: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds group separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? In each ten, once, so from 100-199, there are 10 instances where the units digit is 4: 104, 114, ..., 194. So that's 10 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Units digit 4 appears in 204, 214, ..., 294, another 10 4's.\n\nSame for hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 304, 314, ..., 394, 10 4's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, ..., up to 484. Wait, how many times is that? Let's see, starting at 404, each 10 numbers adds one 4. The last one would be 484. Now, 484 is within 488, so how many numbers is that? From 404 to 484, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9 numbers? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in 400-488, how many full tens are there? 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, the number of times the units digit is 4 would be 9 times, because 89 divided by 10 is 8 full tens and 9 left over. Wait, but actually, 400-488 includes 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 484 is the ninth occurrence. So, 9 4's in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds place had 89 4's, which is correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Then, tens place across all hundreds digits: 10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 10 for 400-449, but wait, no, earlier I thought 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 449 is within 488, so that's correct. So 10 each for all four hundreds digits, totaling 40. Then units place: 10 each for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 9 for 400-488, totaling 39. So 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Then single-digit 1 and two-digit 19, so 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 4's. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach.\n\nSingle-digit pages (1-9): Page 8 is the only single-digit page with an 8. So that's 1.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99): Let's consider tens and units places.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 from 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: For each ten, the units digit is 8 once. So from 10-99, there are 9 decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So that's 9 8's.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488): Let's break it down by hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, 4. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds group, the tens digit can be 0-9. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit 8 appears from 180-189, which is 10 numbers. So 10 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): 280-289, another 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 380-389, another 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, for hundreds digit 4, we have 9 8's (480-488).\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers: For each hundreds group, how many times does 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The units digit 8 appears in 108, 118, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): 208, 218, ..., 298, another 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): 308, 318, ..., 398, another 10 8's.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count these: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included. So, 9 8's in the units place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit 8's. Tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Units place: same, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. So 39 + 39 = 78, plus single-digit 1 and two-digit 19, so 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each part again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place (40-49: 10) + units place (14,24,...,94: 9) = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place (80-89: 10) + units place (18,28,...,98: 9) = 19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nTotal three-digit 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the three-digit counts, especially for the hundreds place. Let me confirm.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundreds group, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 4's in the tens place (40-49 in each hundred), and for 400-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So 40 total. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, for each hundreds group except the last, it's 10 4's, but for 400-488, it's 9 because 488 is the limit. So 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nSame for 8's: hundreds place has 0, tens place has 10 each for first three hundreds, and 9 for the last, totaling 39. Units place same, 10 each for first three, 9 for last, totaling 39. So 78 total.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I first thought about it, I thought maybe the answer was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, let me check the two-digit counts again. For two-digit 4's: 40-49 is 10, and units digits 14,24,...,94 is 9, so 19. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, two-digit 8's: 80-89 is 10, and units digits 18,28,...,98 is 9, so 19. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total counts seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** Only page 4 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 14,24,...,94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) \u2192 40.\n     - Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Single-digit (1-9):** Only page 8 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Units place: 18,28,...,98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences (no 8 in hundreds place).\n     - Tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39.\n     - Units place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39.\n     - Total: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means I'll have to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for each digit. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. But I need to make sure how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. \n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. The remaining pages are 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place of the remaining 8 pages, does a 4 appear? Yes, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. So that adds one more 4. So total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place, each complete set of 10 pages has one 8, so 48 times 1 is 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. That's one more 8, so total 8's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times. So, no difference there yet.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each cycle of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). But since the book goes up to 488, I need to see how many complete hundreds there are and then the partial hundred.\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 ten times (like 40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place would be 4 * 10 = 40. Similarly, 8's would be 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, let's check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nLooking at the tens digit in 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, that's 10 times. Wait, but 441-450 is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 for each of these, so that's 10 instances. Similarly, 8 appears once in 481-488, but since 488 is the end, it's only 8 pages. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? From 481-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 8 pages, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, 8 times.\n\nWait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480 would be page 480, but our range is 401-488, so 480 is included? Wait, 480 is less than 488, so yes, 480 is included. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, 9 times. Wait, but 480 is page 480, so the tens digit is 8 starting from 480. So, pages 480-488 have the tens digit as 8, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 instances of 8 in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, but wait, our partial hundred starts at 401, so 440 is within 401-488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages, each with tens digit 4, so that's 10 instances.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488), the number of 4's in the tens place is 10, and the number of 8's is 9.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place would be 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40 plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place would be 4 complete hundreds * 10 = 40 plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, that's one more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is the hundreds digit 4, right? So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, because each page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nBut what about 8's in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book goes up to 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's = 48 +1 =49, 8's=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds give 4*10=40 for 4's and same for 8's.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's from 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's: none, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nBut wait, page 400 is included, right? So, 400 is page 400, and 488 is page 488, so the count is 488 - 400 +1 =89 pages. Yes, correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about the hundreds place: For 4's, it's 100 pages (400-499), but since the book ends at 488, it's 89 pages. So, 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nNow, another check: total number of digits. Wait, maybe not necessary, but just to see if the counts make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for the partial hundred. Let me recount.\n\nIn the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages, as 488 is the last page. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:10, 8's:9. So, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again.\n\nIn the units place, each set of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8. There are 48 complete sets, so 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the remaining pages are 481-488, which is 8 pages. The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place, the 4's are only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, but in the tens and units places, I have to make sure I'm not double-counting or missing any.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: As above, 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, same result. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 pages in 488 pages: 48 sets (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each set contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place: 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): Units digits are 1-8.\n     - '4' appears once (484).\n     - '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, ..., 301-400): 4 complete sets.\n   - Each set contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710=40 each.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): Tens digits range from 0-8.\n     - '4' appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n     - '8' appears in 480-488: 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Number of pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place in this range.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 cycle. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears once. So, if I have 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. In each of those 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place.\n\nNow, for the 8 extra pages beyond the 480th page, those would be pages 481 to 488. Looking at the units digit in these, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in these 8 pages, the units digit is 4 once (page 484) and 8 once (page 488). So, adding to the units place, that's 1 more four and 1 more eight. So, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49, and units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, in the units place, both 4 and 8 have appeared 49 times each. That means the difference from units place is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so that's 4 complete hundreds and 88 pages extra. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 x 10 = 40 fours and 4 x 10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages: pages 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit cycles every 10 pages, so from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n421-430: tens digit is 2\n431-440: tens digit is 3\n441-450: tens digit is 4\n451-460: tens digit is 5\n461-470: tens digit is 6\n471-480: tens digit is 7\n481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in the range 441-450 (that's 10 pages), and the digit 8 appears once in the range 481-488, which is 8 pages. Wait, but in the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages, so in 88 pages, how does that work? Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in the entire 488 pages. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, so for 488 pages, the number of times each digit appears in the tens place is:\n\nFor each hundred, 10 times. So, for 488 pages, it's 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and 88 pages. So, in the 400 pages, 4 x 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. How many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except the last one, which is 8 and appears only 8 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think: from 401-410, tens digit is 0 (10 pages). 411-420: 1 (10 pages). 421-430: 2 (10 pages). 431-440: 3 (10 pages). 441-450: 4 (10 pages). 451-460: 5 (10 pages). 461-470: 6 (10 pages). 471-480: 7 (10 pages). 481-488: 8 (8 pages). So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears once (10 times in 441-450) and digit 8 appears once (8 times in 481-488). So, in the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for those 8 pages. So, in the tens place, in the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, total in the tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n8's: 40 (from 400 pages) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, but that seems off because from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8, appearing 8 times. So, digit 4 in the tens place appears once in the 400 pages as 40 times, and in the extra 88 pages, it appears once more in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 in the tens place appears 40 times in the 400 pages, and in the extra 88 pages, it appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but that would mean in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, the difference here is 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the units place, they were equal, so maybe the difference comes from the tens place. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appeared 49 times each, so the difference is zero. In the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48, so that's a difference of +2 for 4's. Now, what about the hundreds place?\n\nThe hundreds place: For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From page 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. 200-299: 2. 300-399: 3. 400-488: 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recalculate the tens place.\n\nWait, when considering the tens digit, from 1-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nEach full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 full hundreds, so 4 x 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (401-488). Let's break this down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears once (from 441-450) which is 10 times, and 8 appears once (from 481-488) which is 8 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n8's: 40 (from 400 pages) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nSo, that part seems correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct because 91 seems a bit high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place. Because from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. But in the tens and units places, we've already counted the 4's in those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 never appears there.\n\nWait, another way: perhaps I should count each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try another approach:\n\nCount the number of 4's in each digit place:\n\nUnits place: For each 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds, 4 x 10 = 40. In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place: 8 never appears, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Because from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 times. But when I count the tens and units places, I'm already including those 89 pages. So, perhaps that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with a smaller number to see if my method works. Let's say a 20-page book.\n\nPages 1-20.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: pages 4,14 => 2 times\nTens place: pages 40-49, but wait, up to 20, so tens digit 4 doesn't appear. So, 0.\nHundreds place: 0.\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: pages 8,18 => 2 times\nTens place: 0 (since 80-89 are beyond 20)\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 0.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place: 20 / 10 = 2, so 2 fours and 2 eights.\n\nTens place: 20 / 100 = 0.2, so 0 full hundreds, so 0 fours and 0 eights. Then, remaining 20 pages: tens digits go from 0 to 1 (since 10-19). So, 4 doesn't appear in the tens place, and 8 doesn't appear either. So, total tens place: 0 for both.\n\nHundreds place: 0 for both.\n\nSo, total 4's: 2, 8's: 2. Difference: 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test: 48-page book.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: pages 4,14,24,34 => 4 times\nTens place: pages 40-48: tens digit 4 appears 9 times (40-48)\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 4's: 4 + 9 = 13\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: pages 8,18,28,38 => 4 times\nTens place: pages 40-48: tens digit 8 doesn't appear in tens place here. Wait, 40-48 is tens digit 4. So, tens digit 8 would be in 80-88, which is beyond 48. So, tens place 8's: 0\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 4 + 0 = 4\n\nDifference: 13 - 4 = 9\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place: 48 / 10 = 4.8, so 4 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Plus, in the remaining 8 pages (41-48), units digit 4 appears once (page 44) and 8 appears once (page 48). So, units place 4's: 4 +1 =5, 8's:4 +1=5.\n\nWait, but that's different from my manual count. Wait, in the 48-page book, units place 4's are 4,14,24,34,44: that's 5 times, not 4. So, I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, pages 1-48: units digit 4 appears at 4,14,24,34,44: 5 times. Similarly, units digit 8 appears at 8,18,28,38,48: 5 times.\n\nTens place: For 48 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Pages 40-48: that's 9 pages, so 9 times. 8's in tens place: 0, since 80-88 is beyond 48.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 5 (units) +9 (tens) =14\n8's:5 (units) +0 (tens) =5\nDifference:14-5=9\n\nWait, but using my method:\n\nUnits place: 48 /10=4.8, so 4 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 4 fours and 4 eights. Then, remaining 8 pages (41-48): units digit 4 appears once (44) and 8 appears once (48). So, total units 4's:4+1=5, units 8's:4+1=5.\n\nTens place: 48 /100=0.48, so 0 full hundreds. Then, in the remaining 48 pages, the tens digit cycles 0-4 (since 48 is 4 in tens place). So, tens digit 4 appears in 40-48, which is 9 pages. So, tens place 4's:9, 8's:0.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:5+9=14, 8's:5+0=5. Difference:9.\n\nSo, my method works here.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, the difference is 91. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has. Pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, so that's 9 pages. Pages 10 through 99 are two-digit, which is 90 pages. Then pages 100 through 488 are three-digit, which is 389 pages (since 488 - 100 + 1 = 389). \n\nWait, but maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of counting the pages, maybe I should count the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers. That sounds more efficient.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate how many 4's appear in each place and how many 8's appear in each place, then find the difference.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But wait, page 10 is the first two-digit page, so maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nWait, no, actually, pages 1 to 9 have units digits from 1 to 9, and then starting from 10, the units digits cycle again. So maybe I should think in terms of how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages, and then handle any remaining pages.\n\nLet me try that. The total number of pages is 488. So, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each group of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's is 48 (from each group) plus 1 if the remaining pages include a 4 in the units place. Let's see: the remaining pages are 481 to 488, so the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the units digit 4 appears once here. So total 4's in units place: 48 +1 =49.\n\nSimilarly, the number of 8's in the units place: 48 (from each group) plus 1 if the remaining pages include an 8. The remaining units digits go up to 8, so yes, 8 appears once. So total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so the count for 4's and 8's in the units place is the same? That's interesting. So, the difference in units place is 49 -49=0.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. So, for example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, pages 1-9 have a tens digit of 0, right? Because page 1 is 01 in two-digit form, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.\n\nEach hundred block (e.g., 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10=40. Similarly, 8's in the tens place is 4*10=40.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here go from 0 to 8 (since 401-410 have tens digit 0, 411-420 have 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits go up to 8). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Well, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is fully included, so that's 10 times. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? That would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 50-49=1.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero for pages 100 and above. Each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 pages each. So, 1 appears 100 times (1-100), 2 appears 100 times (101-200), 3 appears 100 times (201-300), and 4 appears 100 times (301-400). Then, from 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 88 pages.\n\nSo, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 100 (from 301-400) plus 88 (from 401-488), totaling 188.\n\nThe number of 8's in the hundreds place: since 800 would be beyond 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, the difference in hundreds place is 188 -0=188.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: +1\n- Hundreds place: +188\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +188=189.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because 189 seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages:488. Number of complete groups of 10:48, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Remaining pages:481-488, which includes 484 (units digit 4) and 488 (units digit 8). So, 48+1=49 for 4's, and 48+1=49 for 8's. So units difference is 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So 4 hundreds contribute 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 440-449: 10 times 4. 480-488: 9 times 8. So, 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Difference:1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in hundreds place from 301-400 (100 times) and 401-488 (88 times), so 188. 8 never appears in hundreds place since the book ends at 488. So, 188-0=188. That seems correct.\n\nAdding up: 0 +1 +188=189. So, 189 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting correctly for the hundreds place. From 301-400, that's 100 pages, so 4 appears 100 times in the hundreds place. From 401-488, that's 88 pages, so 4 appears 88 times. So total 188. Correct.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's, so 1 more 4. Correct.\n\nUnits place: same number, so 0.\n\nTotal:189.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be 189 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 (480 pages), contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks of 100, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 301-400 (100 times) and 401-488 (88 times), totaling 188.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total 4's: 188.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n   - Difference: 188 - 0 = 188.\n\nSumming the differences from each place:\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +188\n\n**Total Difference:** 0 + 1 + 188 = 189.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{189}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each range, I can calculate how often 4 and 8 appear in the units digit. Then, I'll do the same for the tens place and the hundreds place, if applicable.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n1. For 1-digit page numbers (1-9):\n   - The number 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - The number 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - So, in units place, 4 and 8 each have 1 occurrence.\n\n2. For two-digit page numbers (10-99):\n   - The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 9 sets of 10 in the two-digit range (10-99), so 9 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Wait, but 10-99 is 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, yes, 9 times each.\n\n3. For three-digit page numbers (100-488):\n   - The units digit cycles similarly. Each set of 100 numbers (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) will have 4 and 8 each appearing 10 times in the units place for each hundred, except maybe the last one.\n   - Wait, let's see. From 100-199: 100 numbers, so 10 times each for 4 and 8 in units place.\n   - Similarly, 200-299: another 10 each.\n   - 300-399: another 10 each.\n   - Now, 400-488: this is 89 numbers. So, how many times do 4 and 8 appear in the units place here?\n   - Well, from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.), 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - How many tens are there in 400-488? From 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489 but wait, 488 is the last, so maybe 9 tens? Wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but since it stops at 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, actually, how many full tens are there? Let me count: 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), 420-429 (10), 430-439 (10), 440-449 (10), 450-459 (10), 460-469 (10), 470-479 (10), and then 480-488 (9). So that's 8 full tens and one partial ten. So, in each of the 8 full tens, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 8 times each. In the partial ten, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So that's 9th occurrence for each. Wait, no, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 484 and 488 are the ones with 4 and 8 in the units place. So, in this partial ten, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the three-digit numbers, for the units place, 4 appears 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 100-199: 10, 200-299: 10, 300-399:10, and 400-488: 9, so total 10+10+10+9=39 times for 4 in units place. Similarly, 8 in units place: same calculation, 10+10+10+9=39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 100-199: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in units. 200-299: same. 300-399: same. 400-488: for 4, in units place, 404,414,...,484. How many? Let's see, starting at 404, each 10 pages: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times. Similarly, 8 in units place: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Also 9 times. So yes, 39 times each for 4 and 8 in units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but wait, 100-199 is 100 numbers, so 10 times each. 200-299 same, 300-399 same. 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each contributing 1) and a partial ten contributing 1. So 8+1=9 for each. So total units place: 10+10+10+9=39 for 4, same for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\n1. For 1-digit page numbers (1-9), the tens place doesn't exist, so 0 occurrences.\n\n2. For two-digit page numbers (10-99):\n   - The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0-9. So, for each tens digit, 4 and 8 each appear once in the tens place for each set of 100. Wait, no, in two-digit numbers, the tens digit is from 1 to 9, and for each tens digit, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for example, in 10-19, the tens digit is 1, and 4 and 8 appear in the tens place only once each per ten. Wait, no, in the tens place, for each ten, the digit is fixed. So, for example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, in 80-89, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers:\n- 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49).\n- 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89).\n\n3. For three-digit page numbers (100-488):\n   - The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can look at how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n   - For 100-199: the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So, in 140-149, the tens digit is 4, so 10 times. Similarly, 180-189: 10 times for 8.\n   - Similarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10 times for 4; 280-289: 10 times for 8.\n   - 300-399: 340-349: 10 times for 4; 380-389: 10 times for 8.\n   - Now, 400-488: the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last). So, for 4 in the tens place: 440-449, but since we go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place: 480-488. The tens digit is 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. Wait, but in the tens place, each occurrence is counted once per page. So, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 pages, so 9 times. So, in 400-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488).\n\nSo, adding up for three-digit numbers:\n- 4 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times in the tens place.\n- 8 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For 400-488, the tens digit for 4 is 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\n1. For 1-digit and two-digit page numbers, the hundreds place doesn't exist, so 0 occurrences.\n\n2. For three-digit page numbers (100-488):\n   - The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n   - So, 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, for 4:\n- Units place: 1 (1-9) + 9 (10-99) + 39 (100-488) = 1 + 9 + 39 = 49 times.\nWait, no, wait. Earlier, I think I made a mistake. Let me re-express this.\n\nWait, no, earlier I broke it down as:\n- 1-digit: 1 occurrence in units.\n- Two-digit: 9 occurrences in units.\n- Three-digit: 39 occurrences in units.\n\nSimilarly for tens place:\n- Two-digit: 10 occurrences for 4, 10 for 8.\n- Three-digit: 40 for 4, 39 for 8.\n\nAnd hundreds place:\n- Three-digit: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nWait, let me correct this. Earlier, I think I miscalculated the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me go through it again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 1-digit (1-9): 1 occurrence of 4, 1 of 8.\n- Two-digit (10-99): For each ten, 4 and 8 appear once in units. There are 9 tens (10-99 is 90 numbers, 9 sets of 10). So 9 each.\n- Three-digit (100-488): For each hundred, 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in units. But 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so how many full tens are there? From 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, 400-409: 10 numbers, 410-419: 10, ..., 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 9 tens, but the last one is incomplete. So, in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), there are 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in units. For 400-488, it's 9 full tens (400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each 10 numbers) and a partial ten of 9 numbers). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each 10 numbers, so 80 numbers) and a last 9 numbers (480-488). So, in 400-488, the number of times 4 and 8 appear in units place is 8 full tens (each contributing 1) plus 1 in the partial ten, so 9 each. So, for three-digit numbers, 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times each for 4 and 8 in units place.\n\nSo, total units place:\n- 4: 1 (1-9) + 9 (10-99) + 39 (100-488) = 49\n- 8: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49\n\nWait, that's the same? Hmm, but I thought maybe 4 would have more. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. For units place:\n\n- 1-9: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- 10-99: For each ten, 4 and 8 appear once in units. There are 9 tens (10-99 is 90 numbers, 9 sets of 10). So, 9 each.\n- 100-199: 10 each.\n- 200-299: 10 each.\n- 300-399: 10 each.\n- 400-488: 9 each.\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4: 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n- 8: 1 + 9 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, so in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\n- 10-99: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- 100-199: 4 appears 10 times (140-149), 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n- 200-299: same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 300-399: same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, adding up:\n- 4: 10 (10-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 50\n- 8: 10 (10-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49\n\nSo, in tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive, which is 89 pages). 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all occurrences:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in units place, I had 49 each for 4 and 8. In tens place, 4 has 50, 8 has 49. In hundreds place, 4 has 89, 8 has 0.\n\nSo, 4: 49 + 50 +89 = 188\n\n8: 49 + 49 +0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe the hundreds place would give a big boost to 4, which it does, making 4 much more frequent.\n\nBut let me double-check the counts.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n1-9: 4 once, 8 once.\n\n10-99: each ten contributes 1 for 4 and 8 in units. There are 9 tens (10-99 is 90 numbers), so 9 each.\n\n100-199: 10 each.\n\n200-299: 10 each.\n\n300-399: 10 each.\n\n400-488: 9 each.\n\nSo, units: 1 +9 +10+10+10+9=49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n10-99: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\n100-199: 10 each (140-149, 180-189).\n\n200-299: same, 10 each.\n\n300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, 4: 10+10+10+10+10=50\n\n8:10+10+10+10+9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n400-488: 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, 4: 89, 8:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other digits. For example, in the hundreds place, does 400-488 include 89 pages? Let me check: 488-400+1=89 pages. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits printed.\n\nWait, but maybe I don't need that. Alternatively, perhaps I should count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total blocks of 10 in 488 numbers: 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each block, 4 appears once, so 48 times, plus in the last partial block, 484 is the 4th number, so 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 4 appears once in the units place in the last block (484). So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: same logic. 488/10=48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and in the last block, 488 is the 8th number, so 488 is included, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nFrom 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n\nSo total tens place 4's:40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in tens place:\n\nIn each full hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). So I need to check each digit place\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014for both 4's and 8's and count how many times each appears.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately. Maybe I should handle each place (units, tens, hundreds) for 4's and then do the same for 8's and then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For 4's in the units place: in every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once here as well. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: same logic. Each block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So 48 full blocks give 48 eights, and the last partial block (481-488) has 8 in the units place once (488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place. That's interesting. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place. For 4's in the tens place: in each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So for 4 in the tens place, each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). Let me check how many full hundreds there are in 488. Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So for each full hundred, we have 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 401-410, the tens digit is 0, 411-420 is 1, and so on. Wait, no, actually, 401-488: the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., 8 in 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So the 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is less than 490, does that affect it? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So that's another 10 occurrences. So total 4's in the tens place: 4*10 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but 4*10 is 40, plus 10 is 50. But let me confirm: from 1-100, 40-49: 10 4's; 101-200, 140-149: another 10; 201-300, 240-249: 10; 301-400, 340-349: 10. That's 40. Then 401-488: 440-449: 10. So total 50.\n\nNow for 8's in the tens place: similar approach. Each full hundred block has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in the partial hundred, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place: 49. So the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For 4's in the hundreds place: this occurs in the numbers 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: this occurs in the numbers 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's in hundreds place: 0. So the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFirst, units place: 4's and 8's both have 49 each, so no difference there.\n\nTens place: 4's have 50, 8's have 49, so 1 more 4.\n\nHundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0, so 89 more 4's.\n\nAdding up the differences: 1 (from tens) + 89 (from hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but when I calculated total 4's as 188 and 8's as 98, the difference is 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again.\n\nFor 4's in units place: 48 full decades (1-480) with 48*1=48, plus 481-488: 484 has a 4 in units, so 49 total. Correct.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 440-449: 10, total 50. Correct.\n\nFor 4's in hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in units place: 48 full decades, 48, plus 488: 1, total 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 4 hundreds, 10 each, 40, plus 480-488: 9, total 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences, and one more in 481-488 (484), totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, occur once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences. Four full hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 40 from four full hundreds, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur in 400-488, totaling 89.\n   - **8's:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit. Maybe I should handle each of these ranges separately when counting the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each range one by one.\n\nFirst, for single-digit pages (1-9), the only number that has a 4 is page 4. So that's one 4.\n\nNext, for two-digit pages (10-99), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 pages where 4 is in the tens place. So that's 10 fours.\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears once every ten numbers, so from 10-99, the 4's in the units place would be 4, 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but wait, that's from 4, but in two-digit numbers, it's 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. So that's 9 numbers, right? Because 4 is already counted in single digits. Wait, no, actually, in two-digit numbers, the units place can be 4 starting from 14. So from 14,24,...,94, that's 9 numbers. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that affect the count? Hmm, no, because when I'm counting the number of 4's, each occurrence counts separately. So 44 would contribute two 4's, one in the tens and one in the units. But wait, in the two-digit range, I've already counted the tens place 4's as 10 (40-49), and the units place as 9 (14,24,...,94). But 44 is included in both counts, so the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 is in both, so does that mean I'm double-counting? Hmm, no, because each digit is considered separately. So each 4 in the tens place is a separate count, and each 4 in the units place is another count. So 44 has two 4's, so it's counted twice, which is correct. So in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 10-99, how many 4's are there in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 14, so 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 fours. Plus the 10 fours in the tens place (40-49), so that's 19 fours in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100-488. This is a bit more complex because each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units digits. I need to count how many 4's appear in each of these positions.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go up to 488, so not all the way to 499.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 1: 100-199. How many 4's in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 2: 200-299. Similarly, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 3: 300-399. Again, no 4's in the hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. Now, every number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens digit across all three-digit numbers from 100-488.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit = 1: 100-199.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 can appear in 140-149. So that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So 10 fours.\n\n2. Hundreds digit = 2: 200-299.\n\nSimilarly, 4 appears in the tens place in 240-249. That's another 10 fours.\n\n3. Hundreds digit = 3: 300-399.\n\nAgain, 4 appears in 340-349. 10 fours.\n\n4. Hundreds digit = 4: 400-488.\n\nNow, here, the tens digit can be 4, but we have to be careful because the numbers go up to 488, not 499. So in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, but when it's 4, we have 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So 10 fours.\n\nSo total fours in the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 fours.\n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds=4, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 440-449 is indeed within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So total 40 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit from 100-488.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit = 1: 100-199.\n\nIn each set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So in 100-199, the units digit is 4 in 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours.\n\n2. Hundreds digit = 2: 200-299.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 4 appears in 204,214,224,234,244,254,264,274,284,294. Another 10 fours.\n\n3. Hundreds digit = 3: 300-399.\n\nUnits digit 4 appears in 304,314,324,334,344,354,364,374,384,394. 10 fours.\n\n4. Hundreds digit = 4: 400-488.\n\nNow, here, the units digit can be 0-9, but we have to go up to 488. So from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 4 appear?\n\nEach ten numbers, the units digit cycles, so in 400-409, 404 is a 4 in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's okay. So from 400-488, how many numbers have units digit 4?\n\nIt's 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So that's 9 fours in the units place for hundreds digit=4.\n\nWait, but let me count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 fours.\n\nSo total fours in the units place for three-digit numbers:\n\n10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 fours.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488: the units digit 4 occurs at 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSo total units place fours in three-digit numbers: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours in three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal fours in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, let's sum up all fours:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n\nTwo-digit: tens place (40-49: 10) + units place (14,24,...,94: 9) = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each has a 4 in hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nSo 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): page 8 is the only one with an 8. So that's 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\nCounting 8's in tens place and units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place.\n\nSo total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but 88 has two 8's, so does that affect the count? Similar to the 4's, each occurrence is counted separately. So 88 contributes two eights, so in the tens place count, we have 10 (80-89), which includes 88, and in the units place, we have 9 (18,28,...,98), which includes 88. So total eights in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488.\n\n- Hundreds digit=1: 100-199. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit=2: 200-299. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit=3: 300-399. No 8's in hundreds place.\n\n- Hundreds digit=4: 400-488. No 8's in hundreds place, since 800-899 would have 8's, but we only go up to 488.\n\nSo hundreds place: 0 eights.\n\nTens place in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\n1. Hundreds=1: 100-199.\n\nTens digit=8: 180-189. That's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So 10 eights.\n\n2. Hundreds=2: 200-299.\n\nTens digit=8: 280-289. 10 eights.\n\n3. Hundreds=3: 300-399.\n\nTens digit=8: 380-389. 10 eights.\n\n4. Hundreds=4: 400-488.\n\nTens digit=8: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo total eights in tens place:\n\n10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 eights.\n\nNow, units place in three-digit numbers:\n\nAgain, for each hundreds group, count how many times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n1. Hundreds=1: 100-199.\n\nUnits digit=8: 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers, so 10 eights.\n\n2. Hundreds=2: 200-299.\n\nUnits digit=8: 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298. 10 eights.\n\n3. Hundreds=3: 300-399.\n\nUnits digit=8: 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398. 10 eights.\n\n4. Hundreds=4: 400-488.\n\nUnits digit=8: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488. So 9 eights.\n\nSo total eights in units place:\n\n10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all eights in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal eights in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, summing up all eights:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit eights:\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 78. Yes.\n\nSo total eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So total fours: 188, total eights: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the three-digit fours:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 fours.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 fours.\n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 fours in three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Correct.\n\nEights:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of each digit place separately across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nFor the units place:\n\n- For each digit from 0-9, each digit appears equally often in the units place, except possibly the last partial set.\n\nSimilarly for tens and hundreds places.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated, but let me try.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 numbers (488 - 48*10=8), digits 0-8 appear once more.\n\nWait, but actually, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nNumber of complete decades: 48 (since 48*10=480). So each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nThen, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more.\n\nSo total units digits:\n\nDigits 0: 48\n\nDigits 1-9: 48 +1 (for digits 1-8) = 49 for digits 1-8, and 48 for digits 9.\n\nWait, but wait, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get one more count, making their total 48 +1=49.\n\nDigits 0: 48\n\nDigits 9: 48\n\nSo for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 49\n\nNumber of 8's: 49\n\nWait, but earlier I had for units place in three-digit numbers, 39 fours and 39 eights, plus single and two-digit.\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is conflicting with my earlier method. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me try this alternative method.\n\nUsing the formula approach:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times each digit appears in units place:\n\nAs above, 48 full cycles of 0-9, so 48 times each digit 0-9.\n\nThen, from 481-488, units digits 1-8, so each of these digits appears once more.\n\nSo total for units place:\n\nDigit 4: 48 +1=49\n\nDigit 8: 48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the tens place in each hundred.\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (e.g., 00-09, 10-19,...,90-99).\n\nSo for 488 numbers, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo for 4 full hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8 (since 488 is 48 in tens and units). So in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n\nWait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420,...,471-480) and then 481-488, which is 8 numbers (tens digit=8).\n\nSo in the tens place, for 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (e.g., 401-410: tens=0, 411-420: tens=1, etc., up to 471-480: tens=7).\n\n- Tens digit=8: appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit=8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 471-480, so 480 is the last number with tens digit=7? Wait, no, 480 is 480, so tens digit=8, units digit=0. Wait, no, 480 is 4-8-0, so tens digit=8, units=0. So 480 is part of the tens digit=8 group.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens=0\n\n- 411-420: tens=1\n\n- 421-430: tens=2\n\n- 431-440: tens=3\n\n- 441-450: tens=4\n\n- 451-460: tens=5\n\n- 461-470: tens=6\n\n- 471-480: tens=7\n\n- 481-490: tens=8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488.\n\nSo in the tens place:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (from 401-410 up to 471-480).\n\n- Tens digit=8: appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo total tens digits in 401-488:\n\n- 0-7: 10 each\n\n- 8: 8\n\nSo for the tens place overall:\n\nFrom 1-400: each digit 0-9 appears 40 times (4 hundreds * 10 each).\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 10 each\n\n- Digit 8: 8\n\n- Digit 9: 0\n\nSo total for tens place:\n\nDigits 0-7: 40 +10=50\n\nDigit 8: 40 +8=48\n\nDigit 9: 40 +0=40\n\nWait, but I'm trying to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nSo for digit 4 in tens place: 50 times (from 1-400: 40, plus 401-488:10)\n\nWait, no, in 401-488, digit 4 in tens place appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo total for digit 4 in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (from 401-488) =50.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 in tens place: from 1-400: 40 times, and from 401-488:8 times, so total 48.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting manually, I had 40 fours in the tens place and 39 eights. Hmm, there seems to be a discrepancy. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the manual count earlier for three-digit numbers, I had for tens place:\n\n10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) =40 fours.\n\nBut according to this formula, it's 50 fours in the tens place. That's a conflict.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the manual count. Let me check again.\n\nIn manual count for three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place fours:\n\n- Hundreds=1: 140-149:10\n\n- Hundreds=2:240-249:10\n\n- Hundreds=3:340-349:10\n\n- Hundreds=4:440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 fours.\n\nSo total tens place fours in three-digit numbers: 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nBut according to the formula approach, it's 50. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, the formula approach counts from 1-488, so including two-digit numbers as well. Wait, no, in the formula approach, I was considering the tens place across all numbers, including two-digit and single-digit.\n\nWait, no, in the formula approach, I was considering the entire range 1-488, so the tens place counts include two-digit and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but in the manual count earlier, I separated single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. So perhaps the formula approach is counting all numbers, while the manual count was only for three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nIn the manual count earlier, I counted:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 four\n\n- Two-digit:19 fours\n\n- Three-digit:168 fours\n\nTotal fours:188.\n\nBut using the formula approach, for units, tens, hundreds:\n\nUnits place:49 fours\n\nTens place:50 fours\n\nHundreds place:89 fours\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nYes, that matches. So in the formula approach, for tens place, digit 4 appears 50 times, which includes both two-digit and three-digit numbers.\n\nBut in the manual count, I had:\n\n- Two-digit numbers: tens place fours=10 (40-49)\n\n- Three-digit numbers: tens place fours=40 (10+10+10+10)\n\nSo total tens place fours:10+40=50, which matches the formula approach.\n\nSimilarly, for units place:\n\n- Single-digit:1 four\n\n- Two-digit:9 fours\n\n- Three-digit:39 fours\n\nTotal units place fours:1+9+39=49, which matches the formula approach.\n\nSo, the manual count was correct, and the formula approach confirms it.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nUsing the formula approach:\n\nUnits place:49 eights\n\nTens place:48 eights\n\nHundreds place:0 eights\n\nTotal eights:49+48=97.\n\nWait, but earlier manual count was 98 eights. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nIn the formula approach:\n\nUnits place:49 eights\n\nTens place:48 eights\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:97.\n\nBut manual count was:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula approach.\n\nLet me recount the tens place for eights.\n\nFrom 1-488, in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred (1-100,101-200,201-300,301-400) has 10 eights in the tens place (80-89 in each hundred). So 4 hundreds *10=40 eights.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit=8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights.\n\nSo total tens place eights:40+8=48.\n\nUnits place eights:\n\nEach hundred has 10 eights in the units place (e.g., x08,x18,...,x98). So 4 hundreds *10=40 eights.\n\nIn 401-488, units digit=8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nSo total units place eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal eights:48+49=97.\n\nBut manual count was 98. So where's the discrepancy?\n\nWait, in the manual count, I had:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal:98.\n\nBut according to the formula approach, it's 97.\n\nWait, perhaps I double-counted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the manual count for two-digit numbers, I had 19 eights, which includes:\n\n- Tens place:10 (80-89)\n\n- Units place:9 (18,28,...,98)\n\nBut 88 is included in both, so that's correct as it contributes two eights.\n\nSo total eights in two-digit numbers:10+9=19.\n\nIn the formula approach, two-digit numbers:\n\nTens place eights:10 (80-89)\n\nUnits place eights:9 (18,28,...,98)\n\nSo total eights in two-digit numbers:19, same as manual count.\n\nIn three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place eights:10 (180-189) +10 (280-289)+10 (380-389)+8 (480-488)=38.\n\nUnits place eights:10 (108,118,...,198)+10 (208,...,298)+10 (308,...,398)+9 (408,...,488)=39.\n\nSo total eights in three-digit numbers:38+39=77.\n\nAdding single-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:77.\n\nTotal eights:1+19+77=97.\n\nAh, so earlier I must have miscounted the three-digit eights. I thought it was 78, but it's actually 77.\n\nSo total eights:97.\n\nThus, the difference between fours and eights is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nIn the manual count:\n\nThree-digit eights:\n\nTens place:10+10+10+8=38\n\nUnits place:10+10+10+9=39\n\nTotal:38+39=77.\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nTotal eights:1+19+77=97.\n\nFours:188.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo the correct difference is 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90. So where did I go wrong?\n\nIn the initial manual count, I had three-digit eights as 78, but it's actually 77.\n\nBecause in the tens place, 401-488 contributes 8 eights, not 9.\n\nYes, so 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2)+10 (hundreds=3)+8 (hundreds=4)=38.\n\nSimilarly, units place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal:77.\n\nThus, total eights:97.\n\nSo the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the formula approach again.\n\nUnits place:49 eights.\n\nTens place:48 eights.\n\nTotal:97.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is 91 more fours than eights.\n\nBut earlier I thought it was 90. So I must have made a mistake in the manual count of three-digit eights.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for tens place eights:\n\n100-199:180-189:10\n\n200-299:280-289:10\n\n300-399:380-389:10\n\n400-488:480-488"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means I have to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for each digit.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how often each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. But wait, the first page is 1, so maybe the first block is 1-10, which does include 10, but page 10 is included, so that's correct.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in each complete block, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nBut then there's the partial block from 481 to 488. Let's list those page numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Now, looking at the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, we have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, that adds 1 more 4 and 1 more 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 +1=49\nTotal 8's in units place:48 +1=49\n\nHmm, so they are equal so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's see, the tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit, we have 40-49 in the tens place, but wait, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages (440-449). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 449 is within 488, so yes, 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- ...\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is the start, then 481,482,...,488, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, but when I think about the tens digit, each block of 10 pages has the same tens digit. So, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSimilarly, the 4 in the tens place is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, all within 488. So, 10 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) +10 (partial hundred) = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place:4*10 +9=49\n\nSo, so far, 4's have 50 and 8's have 49 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (but since we start at 1, maybe we don't count that). From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place:89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place:0\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89= 49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188-98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10 pages:48 4's and 48 8's\n- Partial block from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so one 4 and one 8\nTotal units:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488):\n   - 4's in tens place:440-449, which is 10 pages\n   - 8's in tens place:480-488, which is 9 pages\nSo, 4's:40+10=50\n8's:40+9=49\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488:89 pages with hundreds digit 4\n- 8's:0\nSo, 4's:89, 8's:0\n\nTotal 4's:49 (units)+50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=49+50=99; 99+89=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the last page, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, the tens place counts seem correct.\n\nWait, but when I add up, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, so the difference is 90. But I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, you have to be careful with overlaps, but I think in this case, since we're considering each digit separately, it's okay.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the difference is 90.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about each digit place again.\n\nWait, let me think about the units place again. 488 pages. For units digits, each digit 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then the partial block of 8 pages, which contributes one 4 and one 8. So, 48+1=49 for both, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each, and then in the partial hundred, 4's appear 10 times and 8's appear 9 times, so 40+10=50 for 4's, and 40+9=49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, only 4's appear 89 times, and 8's don't appear at all, so 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's appear 10 times in the partial hundred, so that's 10. And in the units place, 49. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, in the tens place, 9 times in the partial hundred, so 40+9=49, plus 49 in the units, total 98.\n\nYes, so 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm going to check another way. Let me calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- Number of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if the last partial block has a 4 in units place. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last units digit is 8, so the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is within 488. So, 48+1=49\n- Similarly, number of 8's: same logic, 48+1=49\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n- In the partial hundred (401-488), 4's in tens place: from 440-449, which is 10 numbers\n- 8's in tens place: from 480-488, which is 9 numbers\nTotal 4's:40+10=50\nTotal 8's:40+9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's\n- 8's: none, since 800 is beyond 488\n\nSo, totals:\n4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Range:** The book has pages numbered from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n     - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 48\u00d710=480).\n     - Each block contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n     - Partial block (481-488): units digits are 1-8, contributing one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n     - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n     - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n     - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n     - Partial hundred (401-488):\n       - '4' in tens place: 440-449 (10 times)\n       - '8' in tens place: 480-488 (9 times)\n     - Total '4's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50\n     - Total '8's in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n     - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89\n     - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0\n\n3. **Sum Up the Totals:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total '4's - Total '8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let's start by categorizing the pages based on their number of digits.\n\nPages 1 through 9 are single-digit numbers, so each of these pages is just one number. Pages 10 through 99 are two-digit numbers, and pages 100 through 488 are three-digit numbers. I'll need to check each category separately to count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position\u2014units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9), the only digit is the units place. Here, the number 4 appears once (page 4), and the number 8 appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit pages, there's one more 4 than 8? Wait, no, actually, both appear once, so the difference here is zero.\n\nMoving on to two-digit pages (10-99). Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count the number of 4's and 8's in both places.\n\nFirst, let's look at the units place for two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every ten numbers. So, in each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 occurrences of 4 and 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place. Wait, no, actually, 10-99 is 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, yes, 9 times each for units place.\n\nNow, the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for each digit from 1 to 9, there are 10 numbers where that digit is in the tens place. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's pages 40-49, which is 10 pages. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, that's pages 80-89, which is another 10 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times, and in the tens place, they each appear 10 times. So total for two-digit numbers: 4's are 9 + 10 = 19, and 8's are 9 + 10 = 19. So, again, the difference is zero in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, onto three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. Three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's tackle each place separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for each hundreds digit, there are 100 numbers (e.g., 100-199, 200-299, etc.), except the last one, which goes up to 488.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nLet's start with the first three hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. Each of these spans 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers, so for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). So, for each of these three hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, across 100-399, that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the last hundred is 400-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place in three-digit numbers: 4's are 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times. 8's are 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Similar to the tens place, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place for each hundred. Let's break it down.\n\nAgain, considering 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each of these hundreds has 100 numbers, so in each, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place. So, that's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place across these hundreds.\n\nNow, for 400-488: the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. Since 400-488 is 89 pages, the units digit goes through 9 full cycles (0-9) for 400-480, and then from 481 to 488, which is 8 more pages. Wait, actually, let me think differently. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 89 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 9. So, 8 full cycles of 0-9, and then 9 more pages.\n\nIn each full cycle, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 8 cycles \u00d7 1 = 8 times each. Then, in the remaining 9 pages (481-489, but since it's up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages, right? Wait, 480 +1 is 481, and 488 is the last page. So, 481 to 488 is 8 pages. So, the units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these 8 pages, does 4 or 8 appear in the units place? Yes, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 8 (from the full cycles) + 1 = 9 times, and 8 appears 8 +1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The full cycles from 400-480: that's 81 pages? Wait, no, 400-480 is 81 pages, but 400-480 is 81 pages? Wait, 480 - 400 +1 = 81. So, 81 pages. How many full cycles of 10 are in 81? 8 full cycles (80 pages) and 1 remaining page (481). Wait, no, 400-480 is 81 pages, so 8 full tens (400-479) and then 480. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that from 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades plus any remaining pages where the digit appears.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, 89 divided by 10 is 8 full decades (400-479) and 9 remaining pages (480-488). In each full decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 8 times each. Then, in the remaining 9 pages (480-488), the units digits are 0-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, total in units place for 400-488: 8 +1 =9 for 4, and 8 +1=9 for 8.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, units digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 484 has 4, and 488 has 8. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, in the units place for three-digit numbers: 4's are 30 (from 100-399) +9 (from 400-488) =39 times. Similarly, 8's are 30 +9=39 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in 400-488, units place for 4 and 8 each appeared 9 times, so total for three-digit numbers, 4's in units place: 30 +9=39, and 8's: 30 +9=39. So, same as tens place, but wait, no, in the tens place, 4's were 40 and 8's were 39, but in the units place, both are 39 each.\n\nWait, let me correct that. For the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- From 100-399: each hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in units place, so 3\u00d710=30 each.\n\n- From 400-488: as calculated, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in units place.\n\nSo total units place: 30 +9=39 for 4, and 30 +9=39 for 8.\n\nSo, in units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the tens place, 4's were 40 and 8's were 39. So, let me sum up the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168 times.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 8's in hundreds place is 0, but in tens and units, they sum to 78.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488).\n\n- 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n\n- 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n\nSo, total for 4's: 89 +40 +39=168.\n\nTotal for 8's: 0 +39 +39=78.\n\nSo, the difference is 168 -78=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the tens place correctly. For the tens place in 400-488, I had 10 times for 4 (440-449) and 9 times for 8 (480-488). So, 10 and 9, which adds to 19 in the tens place for 400-488. But earlier, I thought that in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nTherefore, adding to the previous 30 each from 100-399, we get 40 for 4 and 39 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 400-488: 9 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nSo, yes, the totals seem correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nSingle-digit pages:\n\n- 4:1\n\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit pages:\n\n- 4:19\n\n- 8:19\n\nThree-digit pages:\n\n- 4:168\n\n- 8:78\n\nSo, total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts again because 90 seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Then, in the tens and units places, 4's appear 40+39=79 times. So, total 4's:89+79=168.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: in tens and units places, 39+39=78.\n\nSo, yes, 168-78=90 more 4's than 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nBut wait, we also have single and two-digit numbers. In single-digit, both have 1 each. In two-digit, both have 19 each. So, total 4's:1+19+168=188. 8's:1+19+78=98. So, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the count for three-digit numbers correct? Because 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Then, in the tens and units places, as calculated, 4's appear 40+39=79 times. So, total 4's:89+79=168.\n\nFor 8's, in three-digit numbers, hundreds place:0. Tens place:39. Units place:39. So, total 78.\n\nSo, 168-78=90 more 4's than 8's in three-digit numbers. Then, in single and two-digit numbers, both have equal counts (1+19=20 for 4's and 1+19=20 for 8's). So, overall, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position across all pages.\n\nLet's consider each digit position separately: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Pages 1-488.\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often, except possibly the last digit if 488 isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nSo, total pages:488.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10:48 (since 48\u00d710=480). So, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 is the last page, so after 480, we have pages 481-488, which is 8 more pages. So, digits 1-8 appear once each in the units place.\n\nTherefore, for units place:\n\n- Digits 0-9 each appear 48 times for the first 480 pages.\n\n- Then, digits 1-8 appear once each in pages 481-488.\n\nSo, total units place counts:\n\n- 0:48\n\n- 1:48+1=49\n\n- 2:48+1=49\n\n- ...\n\n- 8:48+1=49\n\n- 9:48\n\nWait, no, because pages 481-488 have units digits 1-8, so each of these digits appears once more.\n\nSo, units place:\n\n- 0:48\n\n- 1:48+1=49\n\n- 2:48+1=49\n\n- 3:48+1=49\n\n- 4:48+1=49\n\n- 5:48+1=49\n\n- 6:48+1=49\n\n- 7:48+1=49\n\n- 8:48+1=49\n\n- 9:48\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8. So, digits 1-8 each appear one more time, making their total 49, while 0 and 9 remain at 48.\n\nTherefore, in units place:\n\n- 4 appears 49 times.\n\n- 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, in tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred block (e.g., 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there?\n\nThere are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, that's 4\u00d710=40 times each digit.\n\nThen, the remaining pages are 400-488, which is 89 pages. In the tens place, these pages have tens digits from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times do they appear?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 pages.\n\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 pages.\n\n...\n\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 pages.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), and tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: each appears 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50 times.\n\n- Digit 8: 40 +9=49 times.\n\n- Digit 9: 40 times (since 400-488 doesn't reach 490-499).\n\nWait, but 400-488: the tens digits go up to 8, so digit 9 doesn't appear in the tens place here.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times (from 0-7 and 400-488).\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify. For each digit in the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: in the incomplete hundred (400-488), each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), so 10 times each.\n\n- For digit 8: appears 9 times in 480-488.\n\nSo, total for each digit in the tens place:\n\n- 0:40 (complete hundreds) +10=50\n\n- 1:40 +10=50\n\n- 2:40 +10=50\n\n- 3:40 +10=50\n\n- 4:40 +10=50\n\n- 5:40 +10=50\n\n- 6:40 +10=50\n\n- 7:40 +10=50\n\n- 8:40 +9=49\n\n- 9:40 times (since 400-488 doesn't include 490-499)\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so the tens digits go up to 8, so digit 9 in the tens place only appears in 490-499, which isn't included. So, yes, digit 9 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 50 times.\n\n- 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, as calculated earlier, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place:\n\nEach digit from 1-4 appears in the hundreds place. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but we don't count leading zeros, so no hundreds digit). Pages 100-199: hundreds digit 1, 100 times. Pages 200-299: hundreds digit 2, 100 times. Pages 300-399: hundreds digit 3, 100 times. Pages 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 1:100 times\n\n- 2:100 times\n\n- 3:100 times\n\n- 4:89 times\n\n- 8:0 times (since the book doesn't go up to 800)\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:50\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n\n- Tens place:49\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, and now this method also gives 90. So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me cross-verify with another approach. Maybe calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, I could write a small program or use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position up to a certain number, but since I'm doing this manually, the previous method seems solid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Units place:** Each digit (0-9) appears 9 times.\n     - 4 appears 9 times.\n     - 8 appears 9 times.\n   - **Tens place:** Each digit (1-9) appears 10 times.\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 19 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 168 times for 4, 78 times for 8.\n\n4. **Total counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place up to page 488 can be calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks of 10, and then checking the remaining 8 numbers (since 488 is 48*10 + 8). Wait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. But actually, 48*10 is 480, so pages 481 to 488 are the remaining 8 pages. So, in the units place, each digit from 1 to 8 appears once in the remaining 8 pages, but 0 appears once as well, but since we're only going up to 488, the last page is 488, so the units digits in the remaining 8 pages are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each block of 10, and in the remaining 8, it appears once more. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the full blocks) plus 1 (from the remaining 8), making it 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 times, and in the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, that's interesting, so the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, from 1-488, we have 4 hundreds. Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488). Wait, that's actually 5 hundreds, but the last one only goes up to 488. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each full hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more in 441-450, but wait, no, 441-450 would be when the tens digit is 4, but wait, 441 is actually part of the 400s. Wait, no, 441 is 400 + 40 +1, so the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. But in our case, up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 ten times. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so does that affect the count? Wait, no, because the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times. So, total for the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be the tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 300-399 would have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the count for 4 in the hundreds place is 89, and for 8, it's 0. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 49 = 1\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nAnd the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once per 10 pages, so 48 times, plus once in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so another 10. Total 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n\n- Each hundred, 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9. Total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\n8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units place occurrences for 4: 48 full decades (48*1) + 1 in the remaining 8 pages = 49.\n   - Similarly, for 8: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - For 4: 4 hundreds (4*10) + 10 in 440-449 = 50.\n   - For 8: 4 hundreds (4*10) + 9 in 480-488 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and similarly for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 more pages (400-488). Wait, but actually, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, in each subsequent hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for each hundred, 10 times, and there are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's printed is 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers. In each full block, one 8, so 48 times. In the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 488 pages, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 pages (400-488). The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but actually, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's printed is 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) with 1 each, so 48, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each 10, so 40, plus in 400-488, 440-449, which is 10, so total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks, 1 each, so 48, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, 10 each, so 40, plus in 400-488, 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me check again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let me think about how many times 8 appears in each position.\n\nWait, but when counting the tens place for 8's, in the range 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 fours, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries (1-399) contribute 40 fours, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades contribute 48 eights, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries contribute 40 eights, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No contribution as 800-899 exceeds 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me see, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', and so on up to page 488, which is a three-digit number. So, maybe I should handle the digits separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nWait, but page numbers go from 1 to 488, so I should probably consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both 4's and 8's. That way, I can count how many times each digit appears in each position and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a full set of numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, I need to check if 488 is a multiple of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each full group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, in 48 full groups, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, 4's appear 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8's appear 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Again, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits cycle through 0-9 ten times each. But since we're going up to 488, let's see how many full hundreds we have. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (40-49), so that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (80-89) per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, we're going up to 488, so after 400, there's 88 more pages (401-488). So, in the tens place from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400s, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, that's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 is included, so that's 9 pages. So, in the 400s, the tens place for 4's is 10 times, and for 8's, it's 9 times.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 times each from the first four hundreds, the total for 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 300-399 and 400-488, which is a total of 100 (300-399) + 89 (400-488) = 189 pages where the hundreds digit is 4. So, the digit 4 appears 189 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's appear 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place, 4's have 189 and 8's have 0.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 189\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 189 = 288\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check my calculations again because 288 - 98 is 190, which seems like a big difference, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me go back step by step.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nEach full group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full groups (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups). So, 48 * 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units total for 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and same for 8's. So that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 each. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for 4's in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is included). So, 4's get 10 more, 8's get 9. So, total for 4's in tens is 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's is 40 + 9 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's appear in the hundreds place from 300-399 (100 pages) and 400-488 (89 pages), so total 189 times. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 189 (hundreds) = 288.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 288 - 98 = 190. So, 4's are printed 190 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 300-399, that's 100 pages where hundreds digit is 3, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the hundreds digit is 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488. So, 300-399 is 100 pages with hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is 89 pages with hundreds digit 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 189 pages. So, yes, 189 times.\n\nWait, but when I think about the hundreds digit, 4 appears in 300-399? Wait, no, 300-399 has hundreds digit 3, right? So, 400-488 has hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, so the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, not including 300-399. Because 300-399 has hundreds digit 3, not 4. So, that's a mistake. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. So, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, not 189 times. Wait, that's a big correction.\n\nWait, so let me recast that:\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 or 1, depending on how you count, but since page numbers start at 1, the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, 4's in the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8's in the hundreds place: 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, that's a big mistake I made earlier. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89, not 189.\n\nSo, now, let's recalculate the totals.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so I initially thought 4's appeared 189 times in the hundreds place, but that was wrong. It's actually 89 times. So, the correct total for 4's is 188, and 8's are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me verify again. Let me check the hundreds digit:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (for 1-99, it's actually the tens digit that matters, but in terms of hundreds digit, it's 0).\n\n100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, 400-488 is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the tens place again.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens digit?\n\nEach hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400s, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is included).\n\nSo, total for 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: as before, 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. When I calculated the units place, I considered 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to calculate units place: For any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of times = (N // 10) + (1 if d <= (N % 10) else 0)\n\nSo, for 4 in units place from 1-488:\n\n488 // 10 = 48, and 4 <= 8 (since 488 % 10 = 8), so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSame for 8: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the formula is:\n\nNumber of times = (N // 100) * 10 + (if the tens digit is >= d, then (N % 100 >= d*10) ? (N % 100 - d*10 + 1) : 0)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so 10 times per hundred.\n\nSo, for 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: from 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: from 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of 4's is 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and 8's is 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 pages, each contributing one '4' and one '8'.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total '4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total '8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - From 401-488, '4' appears in the tens place 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Total '4's: 89\n   - Total '8's: 0\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'. So, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, in the 488th page, the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be at page 484, which is the 48th set. So, that's 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see. The first block is 40-49 (10 pages), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. So, 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, let me check: from 40-49 is one block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, so 5 times 10 is indeed 50. But wait, does 440-449 include 440 to 449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 minus 400 plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, 401, 402, ..., up to 488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89). Let's add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. But wait, the last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, which is part of the 48th set. So, 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 pages instead of 10. So, how many blocks do we have? Let's see: 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. But the first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 instances, and the last block contributes 9. So, total for the tens place: 4 blocks times 10 is 40, plus 9 from the last block, so 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0). Let's add that up: 48 + 49 is 97.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48 + 49 = 97. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, in the tens place, it's 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and 440-449 is within 488, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's go from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. For 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49? Wait, wait, that's conflicting with my earlier count of 48.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the units place for both 4 and 8.\n\nFor units place of 4: The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? Let's see: The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times, not 48 as I initially thought.\n\nSimilarly, for units place of 8: The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So, both units places have 49 counts, not 48.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier by taking floor division. So, for 4's in units place, it's 49, not 48. Similarly, for 8's in units place, it's 49.\n\nWait, but wait: 488 is the last page, so for 4's in units place, the last occurrence is 484, which is within 488. So, 484 is the 49th term. So, 49 times. Similarly, for 8's, the last occurrence is 488, which is the 49th term. So, both have 49.\n\nSo, that changes my earlier counts.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49 +49=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference remains the same because both 4's and 8's units counts increased by 1. Hmm, interesting.\n\nWait, let me confirm again. So, units place for 4's: from 4 to 484, which is 49 numbers. Units place for 8's: from 8 to 488, which is 49 numbers. So, both have 49 in units place.\n\nEarlier, I thought it was 48, but that was incorrect because I was truncating the division. So, the correct count is 49 for both.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. I had 4 full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the last block 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place: 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total is 49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total is 49+49=98.\n\nDifference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears is calculated by considering each digit position separately:\n\n1. **Units place**: 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place**: 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place**: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**: 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place**: 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place**: 8 does not appear since the book has only 488 pages.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 90 more 4's than 8's are printed.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about the digits in the units place and the tens place separately because the hundreds place might not be relevant here since the book only has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, but actually, since page 1 is just 1, the hundreds digit only starts from 1 onwards. Wait, no, page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in the units and tens places across all page numbers, and similarly for the digit 8, and then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten pages. So, for example, in pages 1-10, the units digits go from 1 to 0, so each digit appears once. Similarly, in pages 11-20, the units digits go from 1 to 0 again, so each digit appears once. So, in each block of ten pages, each digit 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra pages. Each complete block contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place.\n\nBut wait, we also have those 8 extra pages beyond the 48 blocks, which are pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 481 ends with 1, 482 with 2, up to 488 ending with 8. So, in these 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so the units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten pages. For example, in pages 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're starting at page 1, maybe we can think of it as 0 in the tens place. From pages 10-19, the tens digit is 1, from 20-29 it's 2, and so on. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 consecutive pages, except possibly the last block if the total number of pages isn't a multiple of 100.\n\nWait, but 488 is 488 pages, so let's see. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 1-100, each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times. From 101-200, it's the same, and so on. So, let's calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFirst, the total number of hundreds blocks is 4 (since 400 is the start of the last block, ending at 488). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digits go up to 4, but the tens digits would go from 0 to 9 in each hundred.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place across all page numbers up to 488.\n\nSo, for the tens digit:\n\n- Pages 1-99: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times (e.g., 0 appears in 1-9, 10-19, etc., but actually, for 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 9 times? Wait, no, page 1 is just 1, so the tens digit is 0. So from 1-9, the tens digit is 0 for each of those 9 pages. Then from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, appearing 10 times, 20-29, tens digit 2, 10 times, etc., up to 90-99, tens digit 9, 10 times. So, in the first 99 pages, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times (pages 1-9), and digits 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, for 1-100, the tens digits go through 0-9, each appearing 10 times. Similarly, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last block is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, let me break it down:\n\n- 1-100: 100 pages, each tens digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n- 101-200: another 100 pages, same as above.\n- 201-300: same again.\n- 301-400: same again.\n- 401-488: 88 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10.\n\nWait, let me confirm. Pages 401-410: tens digit 0 (401-410 is 10 pages, but 401-410 is 10 pages, right? Wait, 401 to 410 is 10 pages: 401, 402, ..., 410. So, tens digit 0 appears 10 times here. Then 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times. Similarly, up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in each hundred block:\n\n- 1-100: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times.\n- 101-200: same.\n- 201-300: same.\n- 301-400: same.\n- 401-488: digits 0-8 appear 10 times each (for 401-490), but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because we stop at 488.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages.\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 pages.\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 pages.\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 pages.\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 pages.\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 pages.\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 pages.\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 pages.\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 pages (since 481-488 is 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). Wait, that's 8 pages, not 9. Wait, 481 to 488 is 8 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, that's a mistake. So, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times because we have pages 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in that case, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9.\n\nSo, to sum up, in the tens place:\n\n- Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contributes 10 occurrences of each digit 0-9 in the tens place.\n- The last block, 401-488, contributes 10 occurrences for digits 0-7 and 8 occurrences for digit 8.\n\nSo, total occurrences for each digit in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 0: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last block, so 40 + 10 = 50? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, each hundred block has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 4 blocks would be 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in the last block (401-488), digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for digits 0-7, total is 40 + 10 = 50, and for digit 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48, and digit 9 doesn't appear in the tens place in the last block because we don't reach 490-499.\n\nWait, but wait, in the last block, 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so digit 9 doesn't appear at all in the tens place there.\n\nSo, for the tens digit:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 4 blocks * 10 = 40 each, plus 10 in the last block, so 50 each.\n- Digit 8: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the last block, so 48.\n- Digit 9: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, but in the last block, it doesn't appear, so 40.\n\nWait, but wait, the last block is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, digit 8 in the tens place appears from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens digit:\n\n- 0: 40 (from first four blocks) + 10 (401-410) = 50\n- 1: 40 + 10 (411-420) = 50\n- 2: 40 + 10 (421-430) = 50\n- 3: 40 + 10 (431-440) = 50\n- 4: 40 + 10 (441-450) = 50\n- 5: 40 + 10 (451-460) = 50\n- 6: 40 + 10 (461-470) = 50\n- 7: 40 + 10 (471-480) = 50\n- 8: 40 + 8 (481-488) = 48\n- 9: 40 (since in the last block, we don't reach 490-499, so 0)\n\nWait, but actually, in the first four blocks (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in the last block (401-488), digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, digit 8 appears 8 times, and digit 9 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place: 40 (from first four blocks) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 0: pages 1-99: 99 pages, but the hundreds digit is 0, so 99 times? Wait, but page 1 is just 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, which is 99 pages, so digit 0 appears 99 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- 1: pages 100-199: 100 pages, so digit 1 appears 100 times.\n\n- 2: pages 200-299: 100 pages, so digit 2 appears 100 times.\n\n- 3: pages 300-399: 100 pages, so digit 3 appears 100 times.\n\n- 4: pages 400-488: 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: pages 400-488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, since we're looking for digits 4 and 8, let's see how many times each appears in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 4: 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nDigit 8: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4 in this book, since it's 488 pages. So, digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total occurrences of 4 and 8 in all digit places.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the last 8 pages where 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48 +1=49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: For 4, in the first four blocks, 40 times, plus 10 in the last block (441-450), total 50. For 8, 40 +8=48, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+48+0=97 for 8's. Difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but another way to check: total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 is a single digit, so 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, each with two digits, so 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 488 - 99 = 389 pages, each with three digits, so 389*3=1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total digits counted for 4's: 188, and for 8's: 97. So, 188 + 97 = 285 digits accounted for, which is much less than 1356, but that's okay because we're only counting specific digits.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if I considered all the places correctly.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 4's and 49 8's. In the tens place, 50 4's and 48 8's. In the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's. So, adding up, that's correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the last block. I had 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nWait, 401-410: 10 pages, tens digit 0.\n\n411-420: 10 pages, tens digit 1.\n\n421-430: 10 pages, tens digit 2.\n\n431-440: 10 pages, tens digit 3.\n\n441-450: 10 pages, tens digit 4.\n\n451-460: 10 pages, tens digit 5.\n\n461-470: 10 pages, tens digit 6.\n\n471-480: 10 pages, tens digit 7.\n\n481-488: 8 pages, tens digit 8.\n\nSo, that's correct. So, in the last block, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. So, 48 times in total for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the first four blocks, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place, correct. Then, in the last block, digits 0-7 appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, 40 +10=50 for 0-7, and 40 +8=48 for 8.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: the total number of tens digits is 488 pages. Each page has a tens digit, so 488 tens digits. How many times does each digit appear?\n\nSum of all tens digits counts should be 488.\n\nFor digits 0-7: 50 each, so 8 digits *50=400.\n\nDigit 8:48.\n\nDigit 9:40.\n\nWait, 400 +48 +40=488. Perfect, that adds up.\n\nSimilarly, for units digits: 488 units digits. Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages, and then 1-8 in the last 8 pages, so digits 1-8 each get one more, making 49, and 0 remains at 48. So, sum is 9 digits *49 (for 1-9) but wait, no, 0 appears 48 times, and 1-9 appear 49 times each. So, total units digits: 48 + 9*49 = 48 + 441=489. Wait, but there are 488 pages, so units digits should be 488. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recount the units digits.\n\nWait, each page from 1 to 488 has a units digit. So, for the first 480 pages (48 blocks of 10), each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, pages 481-488 are 8 pages, with units digits 1-8. So, digits 1-8 each get one more, making it 48 +1=49, and digit 0 remains at 48. So, total units digits: 48 (for 0) + 8 digits *49= 48 + 392=440. Wait, that's not 488. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, 48 blocks of 10 pages each is 480 pages, correct. Then, pages 481-488 are 8 pages, so units digits from 1 to 8, each appearing once. So, for units digits:\n\n- Digit 0: 48 times (from the first 480 pages)\n- Digits 1-8: 48 +1=49 each\n- Digit 9: 48 times (from the first 480 pages, since 480 is a multiple of 10, so 480 ends with 0, so digit 9 would have appeared 48 times in the units place up to page 480, and doesn't appear in 481-488.\n\nSo, total units digits: 48 (0) + 8*49 (1-8) +48 (9) = 48 + 392 +48= 488. Perfect, that adds up.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was correct, with units digits for 4 and 8 each being 49.\n\nSo, going back, the total 4's are 188 and 8's are 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place every 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 pages in 480 pages, each contributing one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one '4' (at 484) and one '8' (at 488).\n   - **Total '4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total '8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred of pages.\n   - For the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - Digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n     - Digit '8' appears 8 times (pages 481-488).\n   - **Total '4's in tens place:** 40 (first 400 pages) + 10 (441-450) = 50\n   - **Total '8's in tens place:** 40 (first 400 pages) + 8 (481-488) = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '0' for pages 1-99, '1' for 100-199, '2' for 200-299, '3' for 300-399, and '4' for 400-488.\n   - **Total '4's in hundreds place:** 89 times (pages 400-488)\n   - **Total '8's in hundreds place:** 0 times (since pages don't reach 800)\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits are in each page number and where the digits 4 and 8 might appear.\n\nSo, the book has pages from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in the range 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same for the digit 8 (8, 18, 28, etc.). So, in 48 complete groups, each digit (4 and 8) appears 48 times in the units place. Now, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 numbers. So, for each set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Let's see. From 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but actually, the first set is 1-99, right? Because page 1 is the first page, not 0. Hmm, maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as 1-488, which is 488 numbers. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 100 numbers, except the last one, which might be shorter. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 200-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401-488. Wait, no, that's not quite right because 400-488 is 89 numbers, not 100. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens position. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for pages 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place from 1-100. Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit cycles again 0-9 ten times each, and so on.\n\nSo, for each full hundred, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times. Now, how many full hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 4 full hundreds would be up to page 400, and then we have pages 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). Since we have 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10 for each digit, so 40 times each. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's see, the tens digit in this range is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place here? It would be in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers, but wait, 440 is page 440, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Wait, no, 401-488 includes 440-449, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 times. Therefore, in the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4 full hundreds give 40 times each for 4 and 8, and the partial hundred gives 10 for 4 and 9 for 8. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second, in the partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 49 for 8's in tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in 3-digit numbers, which start from page 100. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 3-digit number, the hundreds digit can't be 8 in this book because the last page is 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Each group of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8.\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have 4 in 484 and 8 in 488, so 1 each.\n- So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) give 4*10 = 40 for each digit.\n- The partial hundred (401-488) has:\n  - 4 in the tens place from 440-449: 10 times.\n  - 8 in the tens place from 480-488: 9 times.\n- So, total tens place:\n  - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n  - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 doesn't appear here.\n\nTotal counts:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Position:**\n   - **Units Place:** Count occurrences of '4' and '8' in the units digit across all page numbers.\n   - **Tens Place:** Similarly, count occurrences in the tens digit.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Count occurrences in the hundreds digit, which only appears in 3-digit page numbers.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 consecutive numbers contain one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full groups (480 numbers) plus 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - In full groups: 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - In the last 8 numbers: '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - Full hundreds (1-400): 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): \n     - '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times).\n     - '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - Total tens place: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers. Maybe I should handle each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits that appear are just 1 through 9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, page 4 is the only one, so that's one 4. Similarly, page 8 is the only one with an 8, so that's one 8. So, in the single-digit pages, the count is 1 for 4's and 1 for 8's. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I need to consider both places separately for each digit.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0 to 9. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the page numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the page numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: Each units digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in each set of ten numbers. So, for each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten (10-99), the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. Each set has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 9 times each. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, 8's would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. So, in two-digit pages, the counts are equal, so the difference is still zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. I need to consider each place separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, each appears 100 times (from 100-199, 200-299, etc.), and 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Now, how many 4's are in the hundreds place? Only when the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 times. How about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit doesn't go up to 8 because the book ends at 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred (like 100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8. However, since the book ends at 488, I need to check if the last hundred (400-488) has a complete set of tens digits.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 140-149) and 10 where it's 8 (like 180-189). So, for each of these hundreds, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Since there are 3 such hundreds, that's 3*10=30 4's and 3*10=30 8's.\n\n- For the hundreds digit 4: The tens digit can go from 0 to 8 because the book ends at 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so only 9 times. So, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4's appear 10 times and 8's appear 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Each units digit from 0 to 9 appears once in each ten numbers. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the units place. But again, for the last hundred (400-488), we have to check if it's complete.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8. So, 3 hundreds give 3*10=30 4's and 3*10=30 8's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: The units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, that's 9 times because the book ends at 488, so 484 is the last one. Similarly, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's also 9 times.\n\nWait, let me count again. From 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages starting from 404 up to 484. So, that's (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 9 times. Similarly, 8's in the units place from 408 to 488: same calculation, 9 times.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the 4's and 8's across all places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 4's = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal 8's = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, the difference is 168 (4's) - 78 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's and 8's. Let me recalculate:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3:\n\n- Units place 4's: Each hundred has 10, so 3*10=30\n- Units place 8's: Each hundred has 10, so 3*10=30\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Units place 4's: From 404, 414,...,484. That's 9 times\n- Units place 8's: From 408, 418,...,488. That's 9 times\n\nSo, units place 4's total: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nUnits place 8's total: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nThat's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3:\n\n- Each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 3*10=30 each\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens place 4's: 10 (440-449)\n- Tens place 8's: 9 (480-488, since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\n\nSo, tens place 4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n\nTens place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n\nTotal 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nDifference: 168 - 78 = 90\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so when I considered the tens place for hundreds digit 4, I correctly accounted for only 9 8's in the tens place because 480-488 is 9 numbers. Similarly, in the units place, it's 9 for both 4's and 8's.\n\nSo, I think the calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page ranges.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - Difference: 1 - 1 = 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times (once per ten set), so 9 times each.\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - Difference: 19 - 19 = 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - Total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - Total 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, but since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, page numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. Maybe I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. Maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of ten are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each complete group, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once here as well, in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, how many tens are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. Each full ten contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten, which is 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 4 is included once. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the units place. From 1 to 488, same logic. Each full ten has one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial ten, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 1-9) to 9 (in 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. Wait, but actually, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 = 40 times in the tens place for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place in each hundred (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 times 10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, actually, the tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, 440-449 would be the range where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, 480 is the start, and 488 is the end, so that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 9 times. Wait, but let me check: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for 4 in the tens place: 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 = 50. For 8 in the tens place: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm counting correctly. In the partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, yes, adding 10 to the 40 from the four hundreds gives 50. For 8, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, adding 9 to the 40 gives 49. So, yes, 50 vs. 49, so 1 more 4.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so we can ignore that. Let's see, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times here.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. Then, in the tens place, 50 for 4 and 49 for 8, so that's 1 more. In the hundreds place, 89 for 4 and 0 for 8, so 89 more. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. Let me check that again. For the tens place, in the four complete hundreds, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, 4*10=40 for both. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 for both, correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 might be the correct answer, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it by considering each digit place separately and counting the occurrences.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- Number of complete tens in 488: 48 (since 48*10=480).\n- So, 48 times each for 4 and 8.\n- Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4; same for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- For each 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Number of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n- So, 4*10=40 times for 4 and 4*10=40 times for 8.\n- Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n- For 4 in the tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- For 8 in the tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place in a 488-page book.\n\nSo, total counts:\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number, but considering that 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant contribution, it makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to verify.\n\nLet me list the counts again:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one '4' and one '8'.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - For 488 pages, there are 4 complete groups of 100, contributing 40 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 10 occurrences of '4' (440-449) and 9 occurrences of '8' (480-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - The digit '4' appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place within 488 pages.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about the different positions where the digits 4 and 8 can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I should probably count the number of times 4 appears in each position and do the same for 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once, and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each. Now, in the extra 8 pages, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place counts: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, so in the units place, they are equal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no, let me check again. From 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So total units place: 48*1 + 1 = 49 for 4, and same for 8. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 from 80-89, 10 times. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480, 481,...,488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo total tens place counts: 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40 each. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 4's total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's total tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case since the book has 488 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. Let me see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now I can sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then from 481-488, units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 once (488). So units place: 48 +1=49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 for 8. So 4 hundreds, 40 each. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 times. So 4's tens: 40 +10=50, 8's tens:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place, correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. 8's:49 +49 +0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, except that 488 is the end. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So yes, 9 times. So, that part is correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all those pages. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let me see, for each 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total units place:48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSame for 8 in units place:48 +1=49. So, correct.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Wait, no, 488 is a three-digit number, so pages go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. So, for single-digit pages, the only page with a 4 is page 4. That's one 4. Now, moving on to two-digit pages, from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. So, I should count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the ones place.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: the numbers would be 40-49.

There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, in each decade, the digit 4 appears once in the ones place. So that's 9 times. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 times.\n\nNow, for three-digit pages, from 100 to 488. Let's break this down. The three-digit numbers can be broken into hundreds, tens, and ones places. So, I need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since we're going up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, that's pages 400-488. Now, in this range, every number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and similarly, the ones digit can be 0-9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's think. For each hundred, like 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, we can count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nIn 100-199: the tens digit is 4 for numbers 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\nIn 200-299: similarly, 240-249, another 10 times.\nIn 300-399: 340-349, another 10 times.\nIn 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, across all hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times. Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fit within that? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's 10 times.\n\nNow, the ones place for three-digit numbers. How many times does 4 appear in the ones place? Again, for each hundred, we can count.\n\nIn 100-199: the ones digit is 4 for 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times.\nIn 200-299: similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 times.\nIn 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 times.\nIn 400-488: the ones digit is 4 for 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, how many is that? Let me count: starting at 404, each 10 numbers, so from 404 to 484, that's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up the ones place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second, in 400-488, the ones digit 4 appears at 404, 414, ..., up to 484. Let me check how many numbers that is. The first is 404, then every 10 pages. So, from 404 to 484, how many terms? The difference is 80, divided by 10, so 8 intervals, meaning 9 numbers. So yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89, tens: 40, ones: 39. So 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages: the only page with an 8 is page 8. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit pages: 10-99. Let's count the number of 8's in tens and ones places.\n\nTens place: numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nOnes place: in each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the ones digit is 8 once per set. There are 9 sets (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, 9 sets of 10). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19 times.\n\nNow, three-digit pages: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page is in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 times in hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nIn 100-199: the tens digit is 8 for 180-189. That's 10 numbers.\nIn 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\nIn 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\nIn 400-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the end. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, ones place: how many times does 8 appear in the ones place across three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nIn 100-199: 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 numbers.\nIn 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 times.\nIn 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 times.\nIn 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 8 appears 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 0, tens: 39, ones: 39. So, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 8:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again. Single-digit: 1 (page 8). Two-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19. Three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 is 98. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was counting the 4's, I had 168, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 168 - 98 = 70. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: page 4 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers \u2192 10 times.\n\nOnes place: In each of the 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the ones digit is 4 once. So 9 times.\n\nTotal two-digit 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers \u2192 89 times.\n\nTens place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each except the last one, which is 400-488. Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 10 in each, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 in each hundred, so 4 hundreds? Wait, no, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fit within that? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's correct.\n\nOnes place: For each hundred, 10 times except the last one, which only goes up to 488. So, in 100-199: 104, 114, ..., 194 \u2192 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 204, 214, ..., 294 \u2192 10 times.\n\n300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394 \u2192 10 times.\n\n400-488: 404, 414, ..., 484 \u2192 Let's count: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, ones place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, three-digit 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: page 8 \u2192 1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers \u2192 10 times.\n\nOnes place: In each of the 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the ones digit is 8 once. So 9 times.\n\nTotal two-digit 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 times.\n\nTens place: In each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each except the last one, which is 400-488.\n\nWait, 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10.\n\n300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10.\n\n400-488: 480-488 \u2192 That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nOnes place: In each hundred, how many times does 8 appear in the ones place.\n\n100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198 \u2192 10 times.\n\n200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298 \u2192 10 times.\n\n300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398 \u2192 10 times.\n\n400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488 \u2192 9 times.\n\nSo, ones place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nThus, three-digit 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78.\n\nTotal 8's: single-digit (1) + two-digit (19) + three-digit (78) = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 168, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 168 - 98 = 70.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit 8's in the ones place. From 400-488, the ones digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times, correct. So, 39 in ones place for three-digit 8's.\n\nSimilarly, in tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 39 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 78 in three-digit. Adding single and two-digit, 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 168, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 168 - 98 = 70.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, which it is, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit 4's again. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. Tens place: 10 in each hundred, so 4 sets, 10 each, 40. Ones place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 in the last, so 39. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems right.\n\nSo, the difference is 168 - 98 = 70. Therefore, there are 70 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 168, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 70.\n\n$\\boxed{70}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the problem into units, tens, and hundreds place for both 4's and 8's. Let me start by considering each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for each 10 pages, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. But wait, the book has 488 pages, so how many complete sets of 10 are there? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each complete set of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place of these extra pages, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages, and the same for 8. Now, the book is 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in these pages goes from 0 to 8. Specifically, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, the tens digits in 401-488 are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (441-450), and 8 appears in the tens place for 8 pages (481-488). Therefore, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, let's calculate how many times each hundreds digit appears. From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so 4 and 8 don't appear here. From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 4 and 8 don't appear here either. From 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, again no 4 or 8. From 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8. From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for each of these pages. How many pages are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place 4's: 89, and hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, units total: 48 +1 =49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages (441-450), so 10 more 4's, making it 50. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 8 pages (481-488), so 8 more 8's, making it 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 pages with hundreds digit 4, so 89 4's. No 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188. Total 8's:49 +48 +0=97. Difference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Maybe I should calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, another thought: In the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? From 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits cycle 0-8, but each full ten's place (like 0,1,2,...8) appears 10 times except possibly the last one. Wait, 88 pages is 8 full tens (0-7) and then 8 pages for the next ten (8). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full sets of 10 (401-410, 411-420,...471-480) and then 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times (401-410), 1 appears 10 times (411-420), and so on up to 7 appearing 10 times (471-480), and then 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in the 40s, which is 441-450, that's 10 pages, so 10 times. 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, I had 40 from the full hundreds, plus 10 from 401-488 for 4's, making 50. And for 8's, 40 from the full hundreds plus 8 from 401-488, making 48. That seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I'm missing something? Maybe in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, but does that include page 400? Yes, 400 is included, so 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place, correct.\n\nAnother way: Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach. Let me try that.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal number of units digits = 488.\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place except possibly the last incomplete set.\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10 in 488: floor(488/10)=48, with a remainder of 8.\n\nSo, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\n4 appears 48 +1=49 times.\n\n8 appears 48 +1=49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n\nTotal number of hundreds in 488: floor(488/100)=4, with a remainder of 88.\n\nSo, for each digit in the tens place, they appear 4*10=40 times.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8.\n\nEach digit from 0-8 appears floor(88/10)=8 times, but wait, 88 pages is 8 full tens (0-7) and 8 pages (8). Wait, no, 88 pages is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) plus 8 pages. So, digits 0-7 appear 9 times each (8 from the full tens and 1 from the partial), but wait, no. Wait, let's think differently.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nEach tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times.\n\nWait, no. From 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits cycle as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4*10 (from full hundreds) +10=50\n- 8's:4*10 (from full hundreds) +8=48\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit 1, no 4 or 8.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit 2, no 4 or 8.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit 3, no 4 or 8.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit 4, so 4 appears 89 times (488-400+1=89).\n8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 4's:89\n- 8's:0\n\nAdding it all up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Wait, actually, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and compare that to how many times 8 appears in each position.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, same with 8. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once as well. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488). In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same with 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 blocks, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, that's 10 times. And 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So, adding that to the previous total: 40 (from the blocks) + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page numbers were 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times here.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me double-check. The hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place, correct. So, 4 has 89 more in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. When I calculated units, I considered 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each, and then the last 8 numbers (481-488) contributing 1 each. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the extra 88 numbers (401-488), I considered that the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 from the blocks, plus 10 for 4, and 40 plus 9 for 8, totaling 50 and 49 respectively.\n\nSo, adding up, 4 has 49 + 50 + 89 = 188, and 8 has 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me check if I missed something. Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently, perhaps by considering each digit position separately and calculating how many times each digit appears.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position is to use a formula. For example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated by:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of each position separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me recalculate that.\n\nFor units digit, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Each 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly for 8: same calculation, 48 times in the full groups, and then 8 appears once in the remaining 8 numbers. So, 49 times.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: For each block of 100, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-400, that's 4 blocks of 100, so 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, from 401-488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's when the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place in 401-488, it's when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, total for 8 in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so 4 doesn't appear. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, so 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: Let's consider each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4: Each 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once more. Total: 49.\n\nSame for 8: 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nNow, from 401-488, that's 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? When the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal for 8: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct based on the calculations. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, I think the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) contribute 1 more for both 4 and 8.\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 / 100 = 4 full cycles, contributing 40 occurrences each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think about how the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place, I remember that in every set of ten consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of ten, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. But wait, does this apply to all blocks? Let me check. \n\nFor the units digit, the number of 4's would be the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Similarly for 8's. So, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block of ten, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. Now, looking at the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) up to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100, and similarly for 8. \n\nHow many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each of these 4 complete blocks, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per block, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nNow, the partial block from 401-488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. The numbers go from 401 to 488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's in the block 441-450, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 450 is included, but 451 is the next number. So, from 441-450, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, for the tens digit 8, it's in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there in the partial block?\n\nFor 4's: 10 times (441-450)\nFor 8's: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the partial block, 4's contribute 10 more, and 8's contribute 8 more.\n\nTherefore, total tens digits:\n- 4's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (partial block) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete blocks) + 8 (partial block) = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right, and in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but actually, page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. \n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts from each place:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) have 4 and 8 in units place, so adding 1 each, making 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, the partial block from 401-488: 441-450 gives 10 4's, and 481-488 gives 8 8's. So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's, and 0 8's. That makes sense.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the partial block, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 8's in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 48 blocks \u00d7 1 = 48 each for 4 and 8.\n   - Extra pages add 1 each for 4 and 8.\n   - Total units: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 complete blocks (400 pages) contribute 40 each.\n   - Partial block (401-488) adds 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - Total tens: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 each appear once in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,...,9,0 in the units place. Similarly, pages 11-20 would have 1,2,3,...,9,0 again. So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. So, I should calculate how many complete decades there are and then handle the remaining pages. Let me do that. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for 48 complete sets, the units place would have 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, the remaining 8 pages are 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, we have one more 4 and one more 8. So, adding that, the units place contributes 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, the remaining pages after 480 are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in total, for the units place, we have 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, in the units place, fours and eights are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, let's see how many hundreds we have. The book is 488 pages, so that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for the 400 pages (1-400), the tens place has 4 times 10 = 40 fours and 4 times 10 = 40 eights.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFor the tens digit 4: this occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, our range is 401-488, so 440-449 is entirely within that. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens digit 8: this occurs in 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens place contributes 10 fours and 9 eights. \n\nAdding that to the previous 40 each, the total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. \n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, fours have 50 and eights have 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, actually, let me correct that: the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 onwards.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. The hundreds digits go up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- Fours: 49\n- Eights: 49\n\nTens place:\n- Fours: 50\n- Eights: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- Fours: 89\n- Eights: 0\n\nAdding them all together:\n\nTotal fours = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of fours printed is 188, and the total number of eights is 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours printed is 188 - 98 = 90 more than the number of eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights. 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours. No eights in hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAdding up: fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds digit starts at 1 for 100, but actually, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, right? So, from 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 there. Then, 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399: 3, and 400-488: 4. So, yes, only from 400-488 does the hundreds digit become 4, and that's 89 pages.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait another thing: when I was calculating the tens place for 401-488, I considered that the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. And tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. That seems correct.\n\nSo, adding up, I think the counts are accurate. Therefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just verify the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 pages. So, each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nAnd in the tens place, as I calculated, 10 fours and 9 eights in the last partial hundred. So, 50 fours and 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, I think the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of fours printed exceeds the number of eights by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) has one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488 (8 pages), contributing one '4' and one '8'.\n   - Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - For 400 pages (1-400), 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - Tens digit '4' occurs in 440-449: 10 fours.\n     - Tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488: 9 eights.\n   - Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - From page 400-488 (89 pages), hundreds digit is '4'.\n   - No occurrence of '8' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has. Pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, so that's 9 pages. Pages 10 to 99 are two-digit, which is 90 pages. Then pages 100 to 488 are three-digit, so that's 488 - 99 = 389 pages. Wait, no, actually, from 100 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages. So, in total, that adds up to 9 + 90 + 389 = 488 pages, which checks out.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once here, on page 4. So that's 1 occurrence.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nIn the tens place: The numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 occurrences. Wait, no, from 10 to 99, there are 9 groups of ten, right? So 9 times 4 appears in the units place. So total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the units place, in each ten's group, 4 appears once, so 10 groups would be 10 times, but since we're only going up to 99, which is 9 groups (10-19 to 90-99), that's 9 times. So yes, 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has three digits: hundreds, tens, and units. I'll need to consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, for the hundreds digit being 4, the range is 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? That's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the hundreds digit from 1 to 4, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: The tens digit can be 0-9, so 10 possibilities. When the tens digit is 4, that's 10 numbers (140-149). So, 10 occurrences.\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 10 numbers (240-249). So another 10.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 numbers (340-349). Another 10.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, we need to check how many numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the tens place. The tens digit is 4, so the range is 440-449, but wait, no, the tens digit is 4, so it's 440-449. However, since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is entirely within the range. So that's 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nNow, the units place. Again, considering hundreds digits from 1 to 4:\n\nFor each hundreds digit, the tens digit can be 0-9, and for each of those, the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each hundreds digit, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's 10 times per hundreds digit, because for each combination of hundreds and tens digits, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 10 occurrences (104, 114, ..., 194)\n- Hundreds digit 2: 10 occurrences (204, 214, ..., 294)\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 occurrences (304, 314, ..., 394)\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, we have to consider that the book ends at 488, so the units digit cycles up to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place for hundreds digit 4?\n\nWait, let me think. For hundreds digit 4, the numbers go from 400 to 488. So, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. But since the book ends at 488, the last number is 488, so the units digit goes up to 8 in the last set. So, for hundreds digit 4, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nLet's see: For each tens digit from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last number, so tens digit can go up to 8), the units digit cycles 0-9, except for the last tens digit, which is 8, where units go up to 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit for hundreds digit 4 goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, for tens digits 0 to 8, each has 10 units digits (0-9), but for tens digit 8, units digits only go up to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit 4 appears once, and for tens digit 8, does 4 appear? Let's see: 484 is within 488, so yes, 484 is a valid page number. So, in the units place, for hundreds digit 4, how many times does 4 appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8: for tens digits 0 to 7, each has a units digit 4 once, so that's 8 times. For tens digit 8, units digit 4 appears once (484). So total for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: For hundreds digit 4, tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, so that's one more. So total 9 times.\n\nTherefore, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contribute 10, so 3*10=30\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9\nTotal units digit 4's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this. Alternatively, maybe a better way is to calculate how many numbers from 400 to 488 have 4 in the units place.\n\nThe first number with units digit 4 is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total for units place: 39.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I considered hundreds digits 1,2,3 each contributing 10, which is correct, and hundreds digit 4 contributing 9. So total units digit 4's: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 100 to 399, each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place per hundred. So 3*10=30. Then, from 400-488, as we saw, it's 9. So total 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So 168 occurrences of 4 in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add the single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers. Wait, from 100 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, for hundreds digit 1,2,3, each contributes 100 numbers. But for hundreds digit 4, it's only 89 numbers (400-488).\n\nWait, but when counting the number of 4's in the hundreds place, it's 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, except for hundreds digit 4, which only goes up to 488, so the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10. So, 4 hundreds digits, each contributing 10, so 40, which is correct.\n\nIn the units place, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the units place, so 3*10=30. For hundreds digit 4, as we saw, it's 9 occurrences. So total 39. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:168. So total 1+19=20, plus 168=188. So 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers:10-99.\n\nIn the tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn the units place: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 occurrences.\n\nThree-digit page numbers:100-488.\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 8 is not among 1,2,3,4, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds digit, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 180-189, which is 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 480-488. Since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundreds digit, how many times does 8 appear in the units place.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1,2,3,4:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: The units digit 8 appears once per ten's group, so 10 times (108,118,...,198).\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 10 times (208,218,...,298).\n- Hundreds digit 3: 10 times (308,318,...,398).\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, the units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488. Let's see how many times. For each tens digit from 0 to 8, the units digit 8 appears once. So, how many tens digits are there? From 0 to 8, that's 9 tens digits. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for units place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contribute 10, so 3*10=30\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9\nTotal: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place:39\n- Units place:39\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I missed the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can't be 8, so 0. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:78\nTotal 8's:1 + 19 = 20, plus 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier, for 4's, I had 188, which seems like a big difference. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 8's. Let me go through it again.\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10\n- Units place: in each ten's group, 1 occurrence, so 9 groups (10-19 to 90-99), so 9\nTotal two-digit:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 (180-189, etc.), so 3*10=30; for hundreds digit 4: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9\nTotal tens place:30+9=39\n\n- Units place: for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each has 10 (e.g., 108,118,...,198), so 3*10=30; for hundreds digit 4: 408,418,...,488. How many? Let's see, from 408 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences.\nTotal units place:30+9=39\n\nSo, three-digit 8's:39(tens)+39(units)=78\n\nTotal 8's:1(single)+19(two-digit)+78(three-digit)=98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. That seems like a big difference. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, earlier, I had:\n\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's\n- Tens place: for each hundreds digit 1,2,3,4:10 each, so 40\n- Units place:3*10 +9=39\nTotal:89+40+39=168\n\nThen, adding single and two-digit:\n\n1+19=20, so total 4's:20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut for 8's, I have 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit 8's count.\n\nWait, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 39, and in the units place 39, so total 78.\n\nBut let me check the units place again. For hundreds digit 4, units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, units digit 8 appears 10 times each, so 3*10=30.\n\nSo, units place:30+9=39.\n\nTens place: for hundreds digits 1,2,3:10 each, so 30; for hundreds digit 4:9, so total 39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78.\n\nSingle-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. Total 8's:1+19=20, plus 78=98.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed something in the three-digit numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach, like calculating the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula for each digit position.\n\nFor single-digit numbers (1-9):\n\n- 4 appears once.\n- 8 appears once.\n\nFor two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98)\n\nSo, total two-digit:\n\n- 4's:10+9=19\n- 8's:10+9=19\n\nFor three-digit numbers (100-488):\n\nLet's calculate for each digit position.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488:89 times\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place (since max is 488)\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: in each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, except for 400-488, where it's 10 times (440-449)\nWait, no, 400-488: the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds, 10 each:40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\n\n- In each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, except for 400-488, where it's 9 times (480-488)\nWait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for hundreds 1,2,3: each has 10, and for 4:9. So total 3*10 +9=39.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- In each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the units digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, except for 400-488, where it's 9 times (as we saw earlier)\nSo, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- In each hundred (100-199,200-299,300-399,400-488), the units digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, except for 400-488, where it's 9 times (as we saw earlier)\nSo, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39, total=168\n- 8's: hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39, total=78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n- 4's:1(single)+19(two-digit)+168(three-digit)=188\n- 8's:1(single)+19(two-digit)+78(three-digit)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I didn't make a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's. From 400-488, units digit 4 appears in 404,414,...,484. That's 9 numbers, correct. So, 3*10=30 (from 100-399) plus 9=39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, from 400-488, it's 408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 3*10=30 plus 9=39.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large difference. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nIn units place, each digit from 0-9 appears approximately 488/10=48.8 times, but since we can't have fractions, we have to adjust.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to calculate for each position.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- From 1-488, how many numbers have units digit 4.\n\nThis is every 10 numbers:4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThe number of such numbers is floor((488 -4)/10) +1 = floor(484/10)+1=48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488/10=48.8, so the last number with units digit 4 is 484, which is 48*10 +4=484.\n\nSo, number of 4's in units place:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nNumbers ending with 8:8,18,28,...,488.\n\nNumber of such numbers: floor((488 -8)/10) +1= floor(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units digit: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where 4's had 39 in three-digit numbers, but perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, this approach might be more accurate. Let me try this.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nTotal numbers with units digit 4: floor((488 -4)/10) +1= (484)/10=48.4, floor is 48, +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8: same calculation, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens digit:\n\nFor 4's:\n\nNumbers where tens digit is 4:40-49,140-149,...,440-449, etc.\n\nBut since the book ends at 488, the last set is 440-449.\n\nSo, how many sets of tens have tens digit 4?\n\nFrom 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 0-99:40-49:1 set.\n\nIn 100-199:140-149:1 set.\n\nIn 200-299:240-249:1 set.\n\nIn 300-399:340-349:1 set.\n\nIn 400-488:440-449:1 set.\n\nSo, total sets:5. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89:1 set.\n\n100-199:180-189:1 set.\n\n200-299:280-289:1 set.\n\n300-399:380-389:1 set.\n\n400-488:480-488: which is 9 numbers, so only 1 set but incomplete.\n\nSo, total sets:4 full sets (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one partial set (480-488). Each full set contributes 10, so 4*10=40, plus the partial set:9 numbers. So total 40+9=49.\n\nWait, but that's for 8's in tens place:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place:5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's in tens place were 40, but this approach says 50.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my earlier count. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nEarlier, in three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- For 4's in tens place:40\n- For 8's in tens place:39\n\nBut according to this method, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I considered hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, each contributing 10 for 4's in tens place, so 4*10=40. But according to this method, it's 50, which suggests that I missed some counts.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the tens digit 4 appears in all hundreds, including 0-99. So, from 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in:\n\n- 0-99:40-49:10 numbers\n- 100-199:140-149:10\n- 200-299:240-249:10\n- 300-399:340-349:10\n- 400-488:440-449:10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total 5 sets, each 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\n- 0-99:80-89:10\n- 100-199:180-189:10\n- 200-299:280-289:10\n- 300-399:380-389:10\n- 400-488:480-488:9\n\nSo, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nTherefore, using this method:\n\n- 4's in tens place:50\n- 8's in tens place:49\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\n- 4's:400-488:89\n- 8's:0\n\nAnd for units place:\n\n- 4's:49\n- 8's:49\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Hundreds:89\n- Tens:50\n- Units:49\nTotal:89+50=139+49=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Hundreds:0\n- Tens:49\n- Units:49\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nThis matches my earlier calculation. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought I made a mistake in the three-digit tens place count, but it seems this method confirms the total 4's as 188 and 8's as 98, difference 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting '4's:**\n- **Units place:** From 1 to 488, '4' appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** '4' appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting '8's:**\n- **Units place:** '8' appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** '8' appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how many digits each page number has and where the digits 4 and 8 might appear.\n\nStarting with page 1, the page numbers go up to 488. So, the first few pages are single-digit, from 1 to 9. Then, from 10 onwards, they become two-digit numbers until page 99, and then from 100 onwards, they become three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts. Let me tackle this digit by digit, starting with the units place, then the tens place, and finally the hundreds place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For each digit from 0 to 9, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? From 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10 there are, plus any extra in the last partial group.\n\nSo, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more at 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, let's do the same. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 times 8 appears in the units place. Then, in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, same for 8.\n\nSo, for four full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, 4 appears in the tens place from 441 to 450, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 450 exist? Yes, because 450 is less than 488. So, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. Wait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, but each tens digit is 10 numbers. So, 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers. So, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481 to 488), so the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in this partial hundred. So, total for the tens place:\n\nFor 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so total 50.\n\nFor 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the last partial hundred, so total 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 441 to 450, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, it's from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, 40 + 8 = 48. So, yes, 4 appears 2 more times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in the last partial (484), total 49.\n- 8's: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 in the last partial (488), total 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus 10 in the last partial (441-450), total 50.\n- 8's: 4 full hundreds, 40, plus 8 in the last partial (481-488), total 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me think again. Maybe I'm overcounting somewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, and 4 appears 10 times (441-450), which is correct. 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 4's in tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50, 8's: 40 +8=48.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49+50+89=188, 8's:49+48=97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full blocks (480 numbers) plus one more at 484. Total: 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each block of 10 contributes one 8. There are 48 full blocks plus one at 488. Total: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. Four full hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 441-450. Total: 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. Four full hundreds give 40, plus 8 in 481-488. Total: 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Pages 400-488: 89 occurrences.\n   - **8's:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n5. **Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Let me think about the range of page numbers here: from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, 100-488 are three-digit numbers. Maybe I should handle each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only page 4 has a 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Only page 8 has an 8. So, in single-digit pages, there's 1 four and 1 eight. So far, the count is 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nNext, let's look at two-digit pages, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, for the tens place. The tens digit can be 1 through 9, but since we're dealing with two-digit numbers, it's 1 through 9. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 40 to 49, that's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 80 to 89, that's another 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for two-digit numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, for each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 ten's groups (10-19 up to 90-99), that's 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each ten's group, so also 9 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. When I'm considering the units place for two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers. So, for each digit, it should appear 9 times in the units place, right? Because 90 divided by 10 is 9. So, yes, 9 fours and 9 eights in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait a second, that can't be right because from 10-99, the digits in the units place for each digit (including 4 and 8) occur 9 times each, but the tens place for 4 and 8 each occur 10 times. So, yes, 19 each. So, 19 fours and 19 eights in two-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nNow, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. Let's consider each hundred group separately.\n\nFor 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 140-149, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 180-189, another 10 pages.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: The same logic applies. 4 appears in the tens place from 240-249, 10 times, and 8 appears from 280-289, 10 times.\n\nFor 300-399: Again, 4 appears in the tens place from 340-349, 10 times, and 8 appears from 380-389, 10 times.\n\nFor 400-488: Now, this is a bit different because it doesn't go up to 499. So, the tens digit here goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's fine. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for this group.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, summing up the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 200-299: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 300-399: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 400-488: 10 fours, 9 eights\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\nTotal eights in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each hundred group except the last one (400-488), the tens place for 4 and 8 each occur 10 times. For 400-488, 4 occurs 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, total fours in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 fours.\n\nSimilarly, eights in tens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 eights.\n\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, we'll consider each hundred group.\n\nFor 100-199: The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each ten's group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), 4 appears once in the units place. There are 10 ten's groups, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each ten's group, so 10 times.\n\nSame logic applies to 200-299 and 300-399. Each of these hundred groups will have 10 fours and 10 eights in the units place.\n\nNow, for 400-488: The units digit here goes from 0-9 for each ten, but we have to consider that the last ten is 480-488, which only goes up to 8. So, let's see:\n\nIn 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404) and 8 appears once (408)\nSimilarly, 410-419: 414 and 418\n...\n480-488: units digits 0-8, so 4 appears at 484 and 8 appears at 488\n\nWait, but actually, in each ten's group within 400-488, the units digit cycles through 0-9 except for the last group, which is 480-488, where the units digit only goes up to 8.\n\nSo, how many complete ten's groups are there in 400-488? From 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, and then 480-488. So, that's 9 complete ten's groups (400-409 to 470-479) and one incomplete group (480-488).\n\nIn each complete ten's group, 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each complete ten's group, so 9 times.\n\nIn the incomplete group (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 more for each.\n\nSo, total fours in units place for 400-488: 9 (from complete groups) + 1 (from incomplete) = 10\nSimilarly, eights in units place: 9 + 1 = 10\n\nWait, that can't be right because in the incomplete group, units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears only once, but 4 also appears once. So, yes, 10 fours and 10 eights in units place for 400-488.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive because the last group is incomplete. Let me think again. For each ten's group from 400-409 to 470-479, each has 10 units digits, so 4 and 8 each appear once per group, so 9 groups \u00d7 1 = 9 each. Then, in 480-488, units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears at 484 and 8 appears at 488. So, that's 1 each. So, total fours: 9 + 1 = 10, eights: 9 + 1 = 10. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the units place has 10 fours and 10 eights each. And for 400-488, it's also 10 fours and 10 eights. So, total units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 200-299: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 300-399: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 400-488: 10 fours, 10 eights\n\nSo, total fours in units place: 10 \u00d7 4 = 40\nTotal eights in units place: 10 \u00d7 4 = 40\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me confirm. Each hundred group has 10 fours and 10 eights in the units place, and there are four hundred groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 fours and 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights in units place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 isn't a complete hundred, but as we saw earlier, it still contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the units place because the incomplete group still allows for one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the fours and eights in three-digit numbers.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Fours: 89\n- Eights: 0\n\nTens place:\n- Fours: 40\n- Eights: 39\n\nUnits place:\n- Fours: 40\n- Eights: 40\n\nSo, total fours in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 40 = 169\nTotal eights in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 40 = 79\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights\nTens place: 40 fours, 39 eights\nUnits place: 40 fours, 40 eights\n\nSo, total fours: 89 + 40 + 40 = 169\nTotal eights: 0 + 39 + 40 = 79\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from all three ranges: single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- Fours: 1\n- Eights: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Fours: 19\n- Eights: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- Fours: 169\n- Eights: 79\n\nSo, total fours: 1 + 19 + 169 = 189\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 79 = 99\n\nWait, let me add them again:\n\nFours: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 169 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 169 = 189\nEights: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 79 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 79 = 99\n\nSo, total fours printed: 189\nTotal eights printed: 99\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 189 - 99 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit: 1 four, 1 eight. That's correct.\n\nTwo-digit: Tens place: 10 fours, 10 eights. Units place: 9 fours, 9 eights. So, total 19 each. That seems correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, so 89 fours in hundreds place, 0 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 200-299: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 300-399: 10 fours, 10 eights\n- 400-488: 10 fours, 9 eights\n\nSo, tens place: 40 fours, 39 eights.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 fours and 10 eights in units place.\n\nSo, units place: 40 fours, 40 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 40 (units) = 169\nEights: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 40 (units) = 79\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\nFours: 1 + 19 + 169 = 189\nEights: 1 + 19 + 79 = 99\n\nDifference: 189 - 99 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 189, and the number of 8's is 99. The difference is 189 - 99 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think about how to count the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 repeat once. So, in the units place, each digit, including 4 and 8, appears once every 10 numbers. Now, since the book has 488 pages, let me see how many complete groups of 10 there are. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups and then 8 more pages. In each complete group, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So for 48 groups, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So in this partial group, 8 appears once (on page 488), but 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So total units place 4's are 48, and 8's are 48 +1 =49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Let me check again. The remaining pages are 481 to 488, which is 8 pages. The units digits here go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 8 appears once (page 488), and 4 doesn't appear because 484 is not in this range; 484 is page 484, which is before 481. Wait, 484 is page 484, which is within the 481-488 range. Wait, 484 is page 484, so that's within 481-488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, in the units place, for the partial group, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. Therefore, total units place 4's: 48 (from complete groups) +1=49. Units place 8's: 48 +1=49. So they are equal in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, each complete group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete groups, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), we have page 484 and 488, so two more 4's and 8's in the units place. Wait, that can't be right because 481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 4's = 48 +1=49, 8's=48 +1=49. So equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, for each hundred, each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So each tens digit appears 10 times per hundred. Now, since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages, but actually, 488 is 400 + 88, so 401-488 is 88 pages, but let me confirm: 488 - 400 = 88, so yes, 88 pages. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, so 40 times each digit in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles again. Let's see: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Wait, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, ..., 481-490: tens digit 8, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFirst, in the full hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's break it down. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? From 401-410: 10 pages, tens digit 0. 411-420: 10 pages, tens digit 1. Similarly, up to 481-490: 10 pages, tens digit 8. But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 pages instead of 10. So, for tens digits 0-7, each appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450, tens digit 4)\n- 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488, tens digit 8)\nWait, no. Wait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears as follows:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488)\n\nTherefore, total tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50\n- 8's: 40 +8=48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n8 appears in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49 +50=99 +89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +48=97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach group of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40 times each for 4 and 8. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. As calculated earlier, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds digit for 400-488 is 89 times, but let me confirm: 488-400=88, but since both 400 and 488 are included, it's 89 pages. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188-97=91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete groups (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (page 484) and one 8 (page 488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - For 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Occurrences:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Wait, but since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nLet me start by analyzing how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I should count the number of times 4 appears in each position and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, in each group of 10, 8 appears once. So, 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so that's 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 49. Okay, so units place gives us 48 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, how many hundreds do we have here? From 1-488, there are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 10 times per hundred. Since there are four hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 401-410, which is 10 times. Wait, but 401-488 includes 401-410, 411-420, ..., up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, but 401-410 is the only set where the tens digit is 4. So, that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so that's 10 per hundred. Four hundreds give 4*10 = 40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, actually, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, 80-89 would be in the 480-489 range, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, we have 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, for the digit 4 in the hundreds place, it appears from 400-488. How many times? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, it would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, zero times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- 4's: 48 (from 1-480, 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4). Then 481-488 don't add any, so 48.\n- 8's: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus 488, which adds one more, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: Each hundred has 10 fours in the tens place, four hundreds give 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 401-410, which is 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n- 8's: Each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, four hundreds give 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- 8's: None, as 800-899 is beyond 488, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. With 48 complete groups of 10, there are 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add any more 4's.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, occur 48 times in complete groups, plus once at 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences. Four hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 401-410, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred has 10 occurrences, totaling 40, plus 9 in 480-488, making 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur 89 times from 400-488.\n   - **8's:** Do not occur as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and similarly for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, same with 8. So for each 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages and then 8 more pages. In each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's one more 8 in the units place (page 488). So total units place: 48 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, but hold on, page 488 is part of the last block, right? So maybe I should think of it as 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 481-488 as the last partial block. So in 480 pages, the units digit cycles 48 times, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so only page 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding one more 8. So units place: 48 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, it's a bit different. The tens digit changes every 10 pages, and each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So in each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. But since our book goes up to 488, we have to adjust for that.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n- Pages 1-99: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So digits 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- Pages 100-399: The tens digit again cycles 0-9 for each hundred. So from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8. So 3*10 = 30 for each.\n\n- Pages 400-488: Now, this is a partial hundred. The tens digit here goes from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So let's see, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nWait, actually, the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8. So for 400-409, tens digit is 0; 410-419, tens digit is 1; ... up to 480-488, tens digit is 8. So how many times does each digit appear?\n\nFrom 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So for the tens digit in 400-488:\n\n- 0: 10 times (400-409)\n- 1: 10 times (410-419)\n- ...\n- 7: 10 times (470-479)\n- 8: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo in the tens place from 400-488, 4 appears once? Wait, no, 4 is in the hundreds place here, but we're only considering the tens place. So in the tens place, 4 doesn't appear at all in 400-488 except maybe if the tens digit is 4. Wait, no, the tens digit is the second digit, so for example, in 440-449, the tens digit is 4. So from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So in the tens place from 400-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo putting it all together for the tens place:\n\n- 1-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n- 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 30 times each.\n- 400-488: 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nSo total in tens place:\n\n4's: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again.\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 each.\n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 for each digit in the tens place, so 3 hundreds, so 3*10=30 each.\n\nFrom 400-488: Tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo total 4's in tens place: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50\n\n8's in tens place: 10 + 30 + 9 = 49\n\nOkay, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: Hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 100-399: Hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. So 4 and 8 don't appear in the hundreds place here.\n- Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4. So from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n8's in the hundreds place: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total in hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n\n8's: 0\n\nNow, let me sum up the totals for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each 10 pages, one 4 and one 8 in units place.\n- 488 pages: 48 full blocks of 10 (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n- Each block: 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n- In the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so one 8 in 488.\n- So units place: 48 4's, 48 + 1 = 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- 1-99: Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in tens place, so 10 each for 4 and 8.\n- 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in tens place, so 3*10=30 each.\n- 400-488: Tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n- So total tens place: 4's = 10 + 30 + 10 = 50; 8's = 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 1-99: 0\n- 100-399: 0 (since hundreds digit is 1,2,3)\n- 400-488: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo totals:\n\n4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me think again if I considered everything correctly. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, I think I might have made a mistake in the 400-488 range. Let me check that again. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so only page 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding one more 8. So units place: 48 4's and 49 8's.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the total number of 4's is 187, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 187, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the counting based on the number of digits. Let me see.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 occur once. So, the count for 4's is 1, and for 8's is also 1. The difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 1 to 9, and the units digit can be 0 to 9. So, for each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. Let's count the 4's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80 to 89. Again, 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. For each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each ten, 4 appears once (like 14, 24, etc.) and 8 appears once (like 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 tens in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so for each digit, it appears 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens (10-19, 20-29,...,90-99). So, in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times in total for 4's in the units place. Similarly, 8's in the units place also appear 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, from 10 to 99, for each ten, the units digits go from 0 to 9, so each digit appears once per ten. There are 9 tens, so each digit appears 9 times in the units place. So, 4's in units place: 9 times, and 8's in units place: 9 times.\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. Similarly, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19. So, again, the difference is zero between 4's and 8's in two-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let me think about how to approach this. Each three-digit number has hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFirst, let's handle the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, from 100 to 199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; and 400-488 is 4.\n\nLet me count the number of times 4 appears in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? No, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and for each tens digit, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundreds group, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. But since the last group (400-488) doesn't go up to 499, we have to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to break it down into each hundreds group separately.\n\nFirst, for 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSimilarly, for 200-299: Same thing, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSame for 300-399: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, for 400-488: Here, the tens digit can be 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears only 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 400-488 includes 89 pages. Let me see: from 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For tens digits 0 to 7, each appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), but for tens digit 8, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens place in 400-488, 4 appears once in each ten, but let me check: when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the tens digit being 4 in 400-488 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 200-299: same, 10 each.\n- 300-399: same, 10 each.\n- 400-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's break it down by hundreds group.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, in each hundreds group, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nBut for 400-488, we have to check if the units digit goes up to 9 or stops earlier. Since 488 ends with 8, but the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens digit, even in 400-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 will have units digits 0-9, except for the last tens digit, which is 8, where units digits go up to 8.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, and for each tens digit, the units digits go from 0 to 9, except when the tens digit is 8, where units digits go from 0 to 8 because the last page is 488. So, for tens digits 0-7, units digits go from 0-9, which is 10 numbers each. For tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for units place in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once per ten, so 8 times 10 = 80? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, for each hundreds group, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is 10 per hundreds group, except when the group is cut short.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate for each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: Each units digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above, 10 each.\n\n3. 300-399: Same, 10 each.\n\n4. 400-488: Now, this is a bit different. Let's see how many numbers there are. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. For the units digit, in each tens group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9, except for the last group, which is 480-488, where units digits go up to 8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7 in 400-488, each has 10 units digits (0-9), so 4 appears 10 times in each of these 8 tens groups, so 8*10=80 times? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, for each tens group, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each tens group, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 8 full tens groups (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479), each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. So, 8 times. Then, in the last tens group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 8 + 1 = 9 times for 4 in the units place in 400-488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place in 400-488: Each full tens group (0-7) contributes 1 occurrence of 8 in the units place, so 8 times. Then, in the last tens group, 480-488, 8 appears in 488, which is once. So, total 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For 400-409, units digits 0-9: 4 appears once (404), 8 appears once (408). Similarly, for 410-419: 414 and 418, etc., up to 470-479: 474 and 478. That's 8 tens groups, each contributing 2 occurrences: one for 4 and one for 8. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, for each tens group, 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once as well. So, for 8 tens groups (0-7), each contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 occurrence of 8. So, 8 times each. Then, in the last tens group, 480-488, units digits go up to 8, so 484 is present, contributing another 4, and 488 is present, contributing another 8. So, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, total for 4 in units place in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears 8 + 1 = 9 times.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me try a different approach. The number of times 4 appears in the units place in 400-488 is equal to the number of times the units digit is 4. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? They are 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Similarly, numbers ending with 8: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's also 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in 400-488, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\nTotal 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought 4's in units place in 400-488 was 9, but adding up, it's 39. Hmm, but let me confirm. Each of the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 each, so 30, and then 400-488 adds 9, making 39 for 4's. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the tens place, I had 4's at 40 and 8's at 39. Now, in the units place, both are at 39. So, let me sum up all three places for three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n  - 8's: 0\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40\n  - 8's: 39\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 39\n  - 8's: 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated earlier, 4's appear 40 times and 8's appear 39 times.\n\nIn the units place, 4's appear 39 times and 8's appear 39 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nSo, the difference between 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers is 168 - 78 = 90.\n\nNow, let's sum up all digits across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\nDifference: 0\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\nDifference: 0\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\nDifference: 90\n\nTotal across all pages:\n- 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations for three-digit numbers because 168 seems high.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, which is correct because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) + 0 (since 450-488 don't have 4 in tens place beyond 449). Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, earlier I thought in the tens place, 4's appeared 40 times, which includes 10 in each of the first three hundreds groups and 10 in 400-488, but that's not accurate because in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is only present in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4's in tens place in 400-488 is 10, making total 10+10+10+10=40.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place in 400-488 is 9 because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so 8's in tens place is 10 (from first three hundreds groups) +9=19? Wait, no, earlier I had 39 for 8's in tens place, which seems incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the tens place for three-digit numbers.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 200-299: same, 10 each.\n- 300-399: same, 10 each.\n- 400-488: tens digit cycles 0-8. For tens digit 4, numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. For tens digit 8, numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 +10=40\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 +10 +10 +9=39\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, units place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\n\nSo, 4's: 10*3 +9=39\n8's: 10*3 +9=39\n\nSo, units place: 39 each.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168\nTotal 8's: 0 +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78\n\nSo, the difference in three-digit numbers is 168-78=90.\n\nAdding single-digit and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 each, difference 0\nTwo-digit:19 each, difference 0\nThree-digit: 168-78=90\n\nSo, total difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in three-digit numbers. For example, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, which is correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers.\n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 10 in each of the first three hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 10 in 400-449, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4's in tens place in 400-488 is 10, making total 40.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds groups, and 9 in 400-488, so 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds groups, and 9 in 400-488, so 39 each.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total 168, 8's total 78, difference 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times per ten, so 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n   - Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - Total 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n   - Total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - Total 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n**Total across all pages:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), and 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can count how many times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the totals to find the difference. That sounds like a plan.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nWait, but actually, when counting from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be the number of complete decades (each of 10 numbers) times 1, plus any extra in the last partial decade. Similarly for 8.\n\nSo, let's calculate for 4 first. The number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades). Each contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, the last partial decade is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem asks for how many more 4's than 8's. Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The total number of complete decades is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, in the last partial decade, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. So, same number, so the difference is zero so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, for 8, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nBut wait, after 400, we have 401-488. So, the tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the 400s, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see, 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place. That's 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 has 8 in the tens place, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nWait, but actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go like this: 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (480-488). So, for each digit from 0 to 8, the tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. From 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- 1: 411-420 (10 numbers)\n- 2: 421-430 (10 numbers)\n- 3: 431-440 (10 numbers)\n- 4: 441-450 (10 numbers)\n- 5: 451-460 (10 numbers)\n- 6: 461-470 (10 numbers)\n- 7: 471-480 (10 numbers)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all, so 8 times? Wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for each, so 8 times. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. Hmm, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo, in the 400s (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 8 times. So, for the tens place, in the 400s, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 (from 1-400) * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 401-488, so total 50.\n- 8's: 4 * 10 = 40, plus 8 in 401-488, so total 48.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Wait, from 1-400, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 four times, so each digit appears 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, for the tens digit, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, so far, in units and tens places, 4's are 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99. 8's are 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97. So, 99 - 97 = 2 more 4's than 8's. But wait, I haven't considered the hundreds place yet.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, in 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, 200-299 is 2, 300-399 is 3, and 400-488 is 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, adding that to our totals:\n\n4's: 99 (units and tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 97 (units and tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, let's recount each digit place.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, number of complete decades is 48 (since 488 /10 = 48.8). So, 48 times, plus in the last partial decade (481-488), which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1 =49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 times? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for each, so 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times, but that's incorrect. It's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but that was a mistake. So, correcting that, 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, now, units and tens:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) =99.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89), so 89 times.\n\n8's: 0, since 800-899 isn't in the book.\n\nSo, total 4's:99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:98 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place, for 8's:\n\nFrom 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488: the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, units and tens: 49+49=98 for 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 49 in units and 49 in tens, so 98 total. Then, hundreds place:0. So, 98.\n\nFor 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. So, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 401-488, how many times does 8 appear? 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40+9=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times, plus 40 from before, total 50.\n\nSo, yes, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let me recount the units place for 8's.\n\nUnits place for 8's: from 1-488, how many 8's?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nSo, units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n\n8's:4 hundreds *10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's:89.\n\n8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. So, I think 90 is correct.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd 8's in hundreds place: none, since 800-899 isn't in the book.\n\nSo, yes, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, final counts:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 occurrences. The last partial block (481-488) adds one more '4' (at 484), totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, '8' appears once in each block of 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** In each hundred, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. Over 400 pages, this is 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Additionally, in 440-449, '4' appears 10 times, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** '8' appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40. In 480-488, '8' appears 9 times, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n   - **8's:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, I should consider all possible places where the digits 4 and 8 can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of times the digit 4 appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many full groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, that means there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488) where the units digit doesn't hit another 4. So, units place 4's would be 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 pages. Similarly, this happens in every hundred, like 140-149, 240-249, etc. Now, how many such hundreds are there up to 488? Well, from 1-488, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, that's five ranges, but the last one isn't a full hundred. But for the tens place, each hundred has exactly one set of ten where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets of ten. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 times 10 is 50. But wait, in the last set, 440-449, that's within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, tens place 4's would be 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 minus 400 plus 1 is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, hundreds place 4's would be 89.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, that's 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 8 in 488. So, units place 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, how many full sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89 is one set, 180-189 is another, 280-289 another, 380-389 another, and 480-488 is the fifth set but only 9 numbers. So, each full set contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 full sets would be 40, and the last set contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30. 380-389: 40. Then 480-488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total is 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's would be 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, units place 8's: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 8 in 488, so 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n\nTens place: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4 +9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but our book is only up to 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me check my calculations again to make sure.\n\nWait, for 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each with one 8, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 8's, plus 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 180-189: another 10, so 20.\n\n280-289: 30.\n\n380-389: 40.\n\n480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I was counting the 4's in the tens place, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 48 +50 +89=187.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then 488 adds another, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full sets of 10, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nUnits place for 8's: For each 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many 8's are there in the units place?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 48 +1=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place: 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and the last 8 pages don't include a 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, which ends with an 8, so the units digit is 8, so the last partial group doesn't have a 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's: 48.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, adding up: 48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but I just realized that in the tens place for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't double-count any digits or miss any ranges.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 1-488, every 10th number, so 48 times, correct.\n\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 800-899, but the book ends at 488, so none.\n\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Calculate the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. With 488 pages, there are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 fours. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't add another 4 in the units place.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (including 440-449), each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full groups, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 10 eights each, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages in 488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Find the difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{89}."

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488). Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. For the one-digit page numbers, only page 4 has a 4. So that's 1 occurrence. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99. In the tens place, the 4 can appear in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 occurrences. In the ones place, the 4 can appear in 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, that's 9 times, right? Because from 10 to 99, each ten has a number ending with 4. So, 9 times. So, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19 times.\n\nNow, for three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and ones places. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. For 4's in the hundreds place, only the numbers 400-488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. So, for each hundred, like 100-199, 200-299, etc., the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since we're only going up to 488, the last one is 440-449, which is within 488. So, each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so 4 times 10 = 40 occurrences. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since 488 is the limit, we don't go beyond that. So, actually, it's 10 numbers for each hundred, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is not a full hundred. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, let me correct that. For the tens place, in each hundred block, like 100-199, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so 140-149 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449 each have 10 numbers. But in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total for tens place: 4 times 10 = 40, but wait, does 400-488 include all 10 numbers of 440-449? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 40 occurrences in the tens place.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. The ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each number. So, for each hundred, the ones digit is 4 in 104, 114, 124, ..., up to 484. How many times does this happen? From 100 to 488, each hundred has 10 numbers ending with 4. So, 100-199: 104,114,...,194 \u2192 10 numbers. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294 \u2192 10. 300-399: 304,...,394 \u219210. 400-488: 404,414,...,484. Wait, how many numbers is that? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10. Let's see: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the ninth one (since 404 is the first). Wait, no, let me count: 404 (1), 414 (2), 424 (3), 434 (4), 444 (5), 454 (6), 464 (7), 474 (8), 484 (9). So, 9 numbers. So, in the ones place, the digit 4 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in the ones place, each hundred block from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 occurrences, and 400-488 contributes 9. So, 3*10 +9=39. So, the ones place contributes 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, ones place 39. So, 89+40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Tens place: 4 times 10, so 40. Ones place: 39. So, 89+40+39=168. So, total 4's: 1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) = 1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Wait, 1 (page 4) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) =188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll go through each range.\n\nOne-digit page numbers: only page 8. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: from 10 to 99. In the tens place, 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. In the ones place, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total in two-digit numbers: 10+9=19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: from 100 to 488. Let's break it down.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nTens place: In each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor 100-199: 180-189 \u219210 numbers.\n\n200-299:280-289\u219210.\n\n300-399:380-389\u219210.\n\n400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nOnes place: In each hundred block, the ones digit is 8. So, for each hundred, 108,118,128,...,198; 208,218,...,298; 308,...,398; and 408,418,...,488.\n\nLet's count how many in each.\n\n100-199: 108,118,...,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\n200-299: 208,...,298\u219210.\n\n300-399:308,...,398\u219210.\n\n400-488:408,418,...,488. How many? Let's see: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total in ones place:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + ones place 39=78.\n\nWait, but wait: hundreds place is 0, tens place 39, ones place 39. So, 0+39+39=78.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit)=1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nOne-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10, ones place 9\u219219\n\nThree-digit: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, ones place 39\u2192168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\n8's:\n\nOne-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens place 10, ones place9\u219219\n\nThree-digit: tens place 39, ones place39\u219278\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nLet me start by considering the digits in each place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each set of ten numbers. So, for every 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But since we're starting from 1, the first set is 1-10, so 0 doesn't appear in the units place until page 10. Wait, but in the first 10 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 0 (page 10). So, for the units place, the number of times a digit appears is the number of complete groups of 10, plus any remaining pages beyond the last complete group.\n\nSo, for the units place, the total number of times a digit appears is (number of complete groups) * 1 + (remaining pages if any). Let's calculate the number of complete groups of 10 in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra pages. \n\nTherefore, for the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, plus one more time for the digits 1-8 in the remaining 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, the remaining 8 pages would be pages 481 to 488, so the units digits would be 1 to 8. So, each digit from 1-8 appears once more, and digits 9-0 don't appear in the remaining pages. \n\nWait, but let me check that. If the total number of pages is 488, then the last page is 488, which is part of the 48th group (since 48*10=480), and then 481-488 are 8 more pages. So, in the units place, for each complete group of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, for 48 complete groups, each digit appears 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, digits 1-8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear here. \n\nTherefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from complete groups) +1 (from the remaining pages) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 +1=49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in pages 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (pages 1-9, but actually, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since page 1 is 1, maybe it's better to think of it as 0 in the tens place for 1-9, and then 10-19 have 1 in the tens place, etc., up to 90-99 having 9 in the tens place. So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, each digit appears 4*10=40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Wait, let me check that. Pages 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 481-490:8, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, but only 8 pages. So, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times, except for 8, which appears only 8 times. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, for the tens place in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, the total number of times each digit appears is:\n\nFor digits 0-7: 4*10 (from the full hundreds) +10 (from the remaining 88 pages) = 50 times each.\n\nFor digit 8: 4*10 +8=48 times.\n\nFor digit 9: 4*10=40 times, since 9 doesn't appear in the remaining pages.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Since in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 9 doesn't appear at all in the tens place beyond the full hundreds.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the number of 4's is 50 times, and the number of 8's is 48 times.\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 (4's) -48 (8's)=2.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0 for them, but since we're only considering digits 4 and 8, we can ignore 0.\n\nFrom page 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- Digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 pages, so 100 times.\n- Digit 2: 200-299, 100 times.\n- Digit 3: 300-399, 100 times.\n- Digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- Digits 5-9: don't appear in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the number of 4's is 89, and the number of 8's is 0, since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place anywhere (the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at max).\n\nTherefore, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 (4's) -0 (8's)=89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 (4's) -49 (8's)=0\n- Tens place:50 (4's)-48 (8's)=2\n- Hundreds place:89 (4's)-0 (8's)=89\n\nTotal difference: 0 +2 +89=91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place: Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, plus in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each. So, 48+1=49 for 4 and 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 times per digit. So, 4 hundreds give 40 times each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, digits 0-7 get an extra 10 each, and 8 gets 8. So, total for tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 +10=50\n- 8's:40 +8=48\nSo, difference is 2. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, difference is 89. Correct.\n\nAdding up, 0+2+89=91. So, 4's appear 91 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 4 appears 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's calculate the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (from 1 to 480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add 1 more occurrence each for digits 1-8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in 480 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 occurrences each for digits 0-7 and 8 occurrences for 8.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = 2\n\n3. **Count 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-399: Hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: 2\n   - Hundreds: 89\n   - Total Difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means we have pages 1-9 (single-digit), 10-99 (two-digit), and 100-488 (three-digit). Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately and then compare them.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only page 4 has a 4, so that's one 4. How about 8's? Only page 8, so that's one 8. So in single digits, 4's and 8's are both 1 each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nMoving on to two-digit page numbers: 10 to 99. Now, each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each digit place separately for 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in two-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. If the tens digit is 4, then the units digit can be anything from 0 to 9, so that's 10 numbers: 40-49. Each of these has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, if the tens digit is 8, then the numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers. So, in the tens place for two-digit numbers, there are 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit (1-9), the units digit will be 4 once and 8 once. For example, in the 10's, we have 14; in the 20's, 24; and so on up to 94. That's 9 times for 4's. Similarly, for 8's, we have 18, 28, ..., 98, which is also 9 times. Wait, but wait, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19, 20-29, etc.), so for each digit (4 and 8), there are 9 occurrences in the units place. So, 9 4's and 9 8's.\n\nAdding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 4's, and 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, the difference here is zero again.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break this down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit for 4 is only from 400 to 488, not up to 499. So, let's handle the hundreds place separately.\n\nFor the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, all numbers from 400 to 488 have a 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. How about 8's? Since the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4, there are no 8's in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers in this book. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9 for each hundreds group. Let's consider each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) separately.\n\nFor 100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9, so for each ten's place, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place across the 100 numbers. Wait, no, actually, for each hundreds group, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten numbers. So, in the tens place, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8 (180-189, 280-289, etc.). Since we have four hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let me handle each hundreds group carefully.\n\nFirst, hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each of these has complete tens cycles, so in each, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). So, for each of these three groups, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds group 400-488: The tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, for digit 4 in the tens place, that's 440-449, which is 10 pages. For digit 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up the tens places across all hundreds groups:\n\n- For 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- For 200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- For 300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n- For 400-488: 10 4's, 9 8's\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. For 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 pages (including both 480 and 488). So, yes, 9 8's in the tens place for that group.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundreds group.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, in each hundreds group, for each tens digit, the units digit will be 4 once and 8 once.\n\nLet me calculate this per hundreds group.\n\nFor 100-199:\n- Each tens group (100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place.\n\nSame for 200-299: 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nSame for 300-399: 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nNow, for 400-488:\n- The tens digits go from 0 to 8, so there are 9 tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). For each tens group, the units digit will be 4 once and 8 once, except for the last group, 480-488, which only goes up to 488, so the units digits are 0-8. So, in this group, the units digit 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, for each tens group in 400-488, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nTherefore, for 400-488, there are 9 tens groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 9 4's and 9 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 404 has a 4, and 408 has an 8. Similarly, 410-419: 414 and 418, etc., up to 480-488: 484 and 488. So yes, each tens group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, except that in 480-488, the units digit only goes up to 8, so 488 is included, but 489 is not. So, yes, 484 and 488 are both present, so one 4 and one 8 in units place for that group.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\nTotal units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 39 times each in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\nTens place: 40 4's, 39 8's\nUnits place: 39 4's, 39 8's\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\nTens place: 40 4's, 39 8's\nUnits place: 39 4's, 39 8's\n\nSo, 4's: 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168\n8's: 0 + 39 = 39; 39 + 39 = 78\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page number ranges.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations, because 90 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go through each step again.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1 (page 4)\n- 8's: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 10 4's (40-49), 10 8's (80-89)\n- Units place: 9 4's (14,24,...,94) and 9 8's (18,28,...,98)\n- So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's, 10 + 9 = 19 8's\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, so 89 numbers with 4 in hundreds place. So, 89 4's, 0 8's\n- Tens place:\n  - 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n  - 200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n  - 300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n  - 400-488: 10 4's (440-449), 9 8's (480-488)\n  - Total tens place: 10+10+10+10=40 4's; 10+10+10+9=39 8's\n- Units place:\n  - 100-199: 10 4's, 10 8's\n  - 200-299: 10 4's, 10 8's\n  - 300-399: 10 4's, 10 8's\n  - 400-488: 9 4's, 9 8's\n  - Total units place: 10+10+10+9=39 4's; 10+10+10+9=39 8's\n- So, three-digit 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- Three-digit 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 might be too high. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I overcounted in the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the three-digit tens place for 400-488, I counted 10 4's in the tens place (440-449) and 9 8's in the tens place (480-488). That seems correct because 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nIn the units place for 400-488, I have 9 4's and 9 8's because each tens group (400-409, ..., 480-488) contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. But wait, 480-488 only goes up to 488, so in that group, units digits go up to 8, so 484 and 488 are included, which is correct.\n\nSo, 9 4's and 9 8's in the units place for 400-488. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For three-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nAnd 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nSo, 168 - 78 = 90 more 4's than 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding single and two-digit, which were equal, so overall difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference 90. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each digit place separately across all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should consider that for numbers from 1 to 488, the digit counts can be calculated per digit place.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 4's. Plus, in the last partial decade (481-488), 484 is present, so that's one more 4. So, total 49 4's in units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, plus 488 itself, which is another 8, so 49 8's in units place.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier count where in three-digit numbers, units place 4's were 39. Hmm, maybe this approach is different because it includes all numbers, not just three-digit.\n\nWait, perhaps I should be more precise.\n\nWait, let's think about each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor numbers 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many such numbers are there?\n\nThe last number with 4 in units place is 484, which is 484 = 48*10 + 4. So, 48 full cycles of 10, plus one more in 484. So, 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. 488 is 48*10 + 8, so that's 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the three-digit analysis, I had 39 4's and 39 8's in units place. But that was only for three-digit numbers. So, if I include single and two-digit numbers, the total units place 4's would be 49, as per this calculation.\n\nWait, but in my earlier detailed count, I had 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49 4's in units place. Similarly, 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49 8's in units place. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the three-digit analysis, I had 39 4's in units place, which when added to single and two-digit, gives 1 + 9 + 39 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1-488?\n\nWell, in the tens place, 4 can be in positions 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place.\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-488, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nThat's 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50 4's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nBlocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n\nWait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the three-digit analysis, I had 40 4's and 39 8's in the tens place. But when including single and two-digit numbers, the total tens place 4's would be 50, and 8's would be 49.\n\nWait, but in my earlier detailed count, I had:\n\nSingle-digit: 0 in tens place\nTwo-digit: 10 4's and 10 8's in tens place\nThree-digit: 40 4's and 39 8's in tens place\nSo total tens place 4's: 10 + 40 = 50\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 + 39 = 49\n\nWhich matches the alternative approach. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nOnly in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, adding up all digit places:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When I did the three-digit analysis, I had 168 4's and 78 8's, which when adding single and two-digit gave 188 and 98, respectively. But using the per-digit place approach, I also get 188 and 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because I might have miscounted somewhere. Let me check the per-digit place approach again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's total: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about another way: for each digit place, how many 4's and 8's are there.\n\nWait, in units place, from 1-488, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the three-digit analysis, I had 168 4's and 78 8's, which when adding single and two-digit numbers (1+19=20 4's and 1+19=20 8's) gives 188 and 98, respectively. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd no 8's in hundreds place, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTens place: 50 4's, 49 8's. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but in my initial three-digit analysis, I had 168 4's and 78 8's, which is 90 more 4's. So, that's consistent.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - **4's:** Page 4 \u2192 1 occurrence\n   - **8's:** Page 8 \u2192 1 occurrence\n   - **Difference:** 0\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4's: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences\n     - 8's: 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4's: 14,24,...,94 \u2192 9 occurrences\n     - 8's: 18,28,...,98 \u2192 9 occurrences\n   - **Total in Two-Digit:**\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n   - **Difference:** 0\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4's: 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences\n     - 8's: None\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4's: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 4's; 400-488 has 10 \u2192 Total 40\n     - 8's: Each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) has 10 8's; 400-488 has 9 \u2192 Total 39\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4's: Each hundred has 10 4's; 400-488 has 9 \u2192 Total 39\n     - 8's: Each hundred has 10 8's; 400-488 has 9 \u2192 Total 39\n   - **Total in Three-Digit:**\n     - 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n     - 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n   - **Difference in Three-Digit:** 168 - 78 = 90\n\n4. **Overall Total:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
