    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. Maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the totals to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), 8 appears once (at 8). Similarly, in 11-20, 4 appears at 14, and 8 at 18, and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so 481-488 includes 488, which is the last page. So, yes, 488 is included, so units digits from 1 to 8. So, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place for the partial set. So, units place: 49 times each.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, so the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once. So, units place: 48 full sets (each contributing 1) plus 1 each from the partial set, so 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, in 101-200, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining pages 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here?\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, there are 10 numbers, except for the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers if we count 480 as the first, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, in the tens place, for each digit from 0 to 8, except for 8, there are 10 numbers, but for 8, there are only 9. Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, 401-409: tens digit is 0, 10 numbers (401-410, but 410 is beyond 488, so actually, 401-409 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 9 times? Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10 except for the last one, which might be less.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so 8 full tens and then 8 extra numbers. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the first 8 digits (0-7) appear 10 times each, and the 8th digit (8) appears 8 times. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0, 10 numbers\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1, 10 numbers\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2, 10 numbers\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3, 10 numbers\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4, 10 numbers\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5, 10 numbers\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6, 10 numbers\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7, 10 numbers\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8, 8 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, in the tens place, for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 401-400, which is the 4th hundred, we have 401-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, total for 4 is 4*10 (from the four hundreds) +10 (from 401-488) = 50 times? Wait, no, that can't be right because 401-488 is part of the 4th hundred. Wait, maybe I'm double-counting. Let me correct this.\n\nWait, each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8. Then, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), as we saw, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8.\n\nWait, but that seems off because in 401-488, the tens digit for 4 is 10 times, but 8 is only 8 times. So, total in tens place: 50 for 4 and 48 for 8.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1-400, each hundred has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nOkay, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89), so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences in each place:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 97 = 91, which seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through each place again carefully.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total units place for 4: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: same logic, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for 4 and 4*10=40 for 8.\n\nNow, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), let's check:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place: 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, adding to the previous 40 each:\n\n4: 40 +10=50\n8: 40 +8=48\n\nSo, tens place: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nFor 4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188\nFor 8: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 49+48=97\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for 401-488. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but for each tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, that's 88 numbers. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, that part is correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total numbers from 1-488 is 488. Each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) has a certain number of digits. Let's see:\n\nUnits place: each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, and then the remainder is 8, so digits 1-8 appear once more. So, 4 and 8 each appear 48+1=49 times in units.\n\nTens place: each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, each tens digit from 0-8 appears once, except 8 appears only 8 times. Wait, no, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8, appearing 8 times. Wait, but that would mean 0 appears 10 times (401-410), 1 appears 10 times (411-420), ..., 7 appears 10 times (471-480), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times, and for 8, it's 8 times. So, adding to the 40 each from the full hundreds, we get 50 for 4 and 48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, yes, the totals are 188 for 4 and 97 for 8, so difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me check another way: using the formula for digit occurrences.\n\nFor a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- Let n be the number, here n=488.\n\n- For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), split the number into higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nFor example, in the units place:\n\n- Higher = n divided by 10, so 488 /10=48.8, but we take the integer part, 48.\n\n- Current digit is 8 (units digit of 488).\n\n- Lower = 0.\n\nThen, the count is:\n\nif current > d: higher +1\n\nif current == d: higher + (lower +1)\n\nif current < d: higher\n\nBut wait, this is for a specific digit. Maybe I should use this formula for each digit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use a formula for each digit place.\n\nLet me try this for the units place:\n\nWe want to count how many times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488.\n\nThe formula is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= 4 else 0)\n\nSo, n=488.\n\ncount_4_units = (488 //10) *1 + (1 if (488 %10) >=4 else 0)\n= 48 *1 + (1 if 8 >=4 else 0)\n= 48 +1 =49\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:\n\ncount_8_units = (488 //10) *1 + (1 if (488 %10) >=8 else 0)\n=48 +1=49\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nFor tens place, counting 4's:\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\nhigher = n // 100\ncurrent = (n //10) %10\nlower = n %10\n\ncount = higher *10\nif current >4: count +=10\nif current ==4: count += (lower +1)\n\nSo, n=488.\n\nhigher =488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSo, count_4_tens =4*10=40\nsince current=8>4, add 10: 40+10=50\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\n\ncount_8_tens= higher*10=4*10=40\ncurrent=8, which is equal to 8, so add (lower +1)=8+1=9\nso count=40 +9=49\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, using this formula, for 8 in tens place, count_8_tens=40 +9=49.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 48. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let's think. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 40+9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times, not 8. So, the correct count is 49 for 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times because I thought 481-488 is 8 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, I made a mistake earlier by not including 480.\n\nWait, 480 is included in 401-488, so the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the count is 9, making the total 40+9=49.\n\nSo, that corrects my earlier mistake. So, for 8 in the tens place, it's 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times, making total 40+10=50.\n\nSo, now, let's recalculate the totals.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8 in tens place was 48, but it's actually 49, so the total for 8 is 98, and 4 is 188, so difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the formula again.\n\nFor 8 in tens place:\n\nhigher=4, current=8, lower=8.\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nsince current=8 >=8, add lower+1=8+1=9\n\ntotal=40+9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 91, but now it's 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, hundreds place for 4: from 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8 in tens place was 48, leading to 97, but it's actually 49, leading to 98. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again with another approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCalculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8 in tens place was 48, but with the formula, it's 49, so I must have made a mistake in my initial counting.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any other mistakes.\n\nWait, another way to check: total digits printed.\n\nEach page number from 1 to 488: pages 1-9 are 1-digit, 10-99 are 2-digit, 100-488 are 3-digit.\n\nNumber of digits:\n\n- 1-9:9 numbers, 1 digit each:9 digits\n\n-10-99:90 numbers, 2 digits each:180 digits\n\n-100-488:389 numbers, 3 digits each:1167 digits\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total digits for 4's:188, total for 8's:98.\n\nSo, 188+98=286 digits accounted for, but total digits are 1356, so that's not directly helpful, but just a sanity check.\n\nWait, but the difference is 90, which seems plausible.\n\nSo, after correcting my earlier mistake in the tens place for 8's, the correct difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For every 10 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n     - Total sets of 10 in 488: 48 full sets, contributing 48 times each for 4 and 8.\n     - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n     - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n     - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n     - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n     - In the incomplete hundred (401-488):\n       - 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times).\n       - 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n     - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n     - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears in 400-488 (89 times).\n     - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n     - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n2. **Calculate Totals:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n3. **Determine the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Total 4's - Total 8's = 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Let me think about each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. But wait, the book goes up to 488, which is a multiple of 10 plus 8. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there, and how does that affect the count?\n\nWait, let's calculate the total number of pages: 488. So, the number of complete tens is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 more pages (from 481 to 488). So, in each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nBut then we have the last partial block from 481 to 488. Let's list those units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, there's one 4 and one 8. So, adding that to the previous count, we have 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's is equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. The tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, our range is up to 488. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 pages, but since our upper limit is 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 fours. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, no, 480 is page 480, then 481, 482, up to 488, which is 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 pages with tens digit 8. So, in the partial hundred, we have 10 fours and 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 fours and 40 eights, we get 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8? Well, the hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book only goes up to 488. The next hundred would be 500, which is beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 4's in the hundreds place is 89, and for 8's, it's 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n- Tens place: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding them all together:\n\nTotal fours = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal eights = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has 1 four and 1 eight.\n- 48 complete blocks: 48 fours, 48 eights.\n- Partial block 481-488: units digits 1-8, so one four and one eight.\n- Total units: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds: 40 fours, 40 eights.\n- Partial hundred 401-488: tens digits 0-8.\n- Fours in tens: 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n- Eights in tens: 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n- So, 10 fours, 9 eights.\n- Total tens: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Fours: 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- Eights: 0.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all these page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group, the 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so the 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers every 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit position.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many 8's in units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0. 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's are printed, I subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, is that right? 188 - 98 is indeed 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49. Because every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in the last 8 numbers, 484 is the only one with a 4 in units, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 50. Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 89. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49. Same logic as 4's. 488/10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 49. Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. 488/100=4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. Since 800-899 is beyond 488, no 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. There are 48 full groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. Each group contributes 1 '4', totaling 48, plus one more from 484, making 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 where the tens digit is '4'. There are 4 full hundreds contributing 40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers with '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4's, every 10 numbers contribute one '8'. There are 48 full groups plus one from 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Every 100 numbers have a block of 10 with the tens digit '8'. There are 4 full hundreds contributing 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there? Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, it's 48 full blocks, and then 8 extra pages. In each block, the units digit is 4 once. So, 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think differently. For units digit, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? It's the same as how many numbers between 1 and 488 have 4 in the units place. That's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times, but since 488 is the last page, which is 488, so 488 mod 10 is 8, so the last number with 4 in the units place is 484, which is 484. So, 484 is the 48th occurrence, right? Wait, no, because starting from 4, every 10 numbers, so 4,14,...,484. How many terms are there? It's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 49 times in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such blocks there are.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the following ranges:\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? Let's see, each hundred has one block in the tens place. So, from 0-99, 10-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, but does it include a full block? 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's a full block of 10. So, how many hundreds? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 sets. But in each set, except maybe the last one, there's a full block. Wait, no, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly for 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, so 5 * 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. But wait, that's only if we're considering the hundreds digit. Wait, but in page numbers, 400-488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For example, 400: hundreds digit is 4, 401: 4, etc., up to 488. So, yes, 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place. The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,..., up to 488. How many times does this happen? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing an 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the last block, 480-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, how many times? Let me calculate it as (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49 times. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included, so 8 occurs at 8,18,...,488. So, that's 49 times, correct.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFirst, let's count the full blocks. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. Now, from 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10, which is 40, plus 9 in the last partial block, so 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds: total 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place: as above, 49 times. Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me recount that.\n\nFor the hundreds place, the 4's occur from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place: 49.\n\nWait, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: total 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's 90. Let me see if there's another way to count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula for digit counting. For each digit position, calculate the number of times a digit appears.\n\nLet me try that approach for 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place = (Total pages + 9 - digit) // 10.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is to calculate for each digit position, how many times a digit appears.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 10\n\ncount = full_cycles\n\nremainder = N % 10\n\nif remainder >= d:\n    count +=1\n\nBut wait, for digit 4:\n\nN = 488.\n\nfull_cycles = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince 8 >=4, count = 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for tens place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in tens place from 1 to N:\n\nfull_cycles = (N // 100) * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    count +=1\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider each hundred block.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor tens place:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for digit 4, each hundred block (like 0-99, 100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n\nSo, number of hundreds blocks: 488 // 100 = 4 (since 4*100=400, and 5*100=500>488). So, 4 full hundreds blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the partial hundred block: 400-488. In this block, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times digit 4 appears in hundreds place is the number of numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nSimilarly for 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nfull_cycles = 488 //10=48, remainder=8.\n\nSince 8 >=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 10 times 8 in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNumber of full hundreds blocks: 4 (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399).\n\nEach contributes 10, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the partial block: 400-488.\n\nIn this block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNo page numbers have 8 in hundreds place, since the book ends at 488. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nThus, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nBut wait, after page 480, there are 8 more pages: 481 to 488. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this range, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that to the previous count, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. So, in the first 400 pages, there are 4 blocks of 100, so each digit appears 40 times in the tens place. So, for digit 4, that's 40 times, and same for 8. \n\nBut again, after page 400, we have pages 401 to 488. Let's break this down. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Wait, actually, from 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 400-409), 1 (410-419), up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on. So, the digit 4 in the tens place would be in the 440-449 range. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place is in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, for the tens digit 4, it's from 440 to 449, which is 10 pages. So, 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. \n\nSo, adding this to the previous 400 pages, the total for the tens place would be: 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. And 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. \n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, because from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears 40 times (since each hundred has 10 times, and 4 hundreds would be 40). Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 49, so 4's are more by 1 in the tens place. \n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? From 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so neither 4 nor 8. From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 times. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89, and 8's are 0. So, 4's are more by 89 here. \n\nNow, let's add up all the digits. \n\nFirst, units place: 4's=49, 8's=49. \n\nTens place: 4's=50, 8's=49. \n\nHundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0. \n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188. \n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98. \n\nWait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188. 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations. \n\nUnits place: From 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, but from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 4's=48+1=49, 8's=48+1=49. Correct. \n\nTens place: From 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. So, for tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 +10=50 for 4's. For 8's, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40 +9=49. Correct. \n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's. Correct. \n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188. \n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98. \n\nDifference:188-98=90. \n\nHmm, so 90 more 4's than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I'm missing something? For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct. \n\nIn the tens place, 4's: 40 (from 1-400) +10 (440-449)=50. 8's:40 +9=49. \n\nUnits place:49 each. \n\nSo, yes, 188-98=90. \n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from pages 1-480.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, although 488 is less than 1000, so the thousands place would only be relevant if the book had more than 999 pages, which it doesn't. So, I can probably ignore the thousands place.\n\nLet me start by considering each place one by one. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place as we go from page 1 to page 488. But wait, does it? Actually, since 488 is not a multiple of 10, the last set of pages might not complete a full cycle of 10. So maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So there are 48 complete groups of 10 pages each, and then 8 extra pages. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any 4's in the remaining 8 pages. The remaining pages are 481 to 488, so looking at the units digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So there's one more 4 in the units place (484) and one more 8 (488). Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Each group of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Since there are 48 full groups, that's 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have 484 and 488, so that's one more 4 and one more 8. So yes, 49 each. So units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nBut again, since 488 is less than 500, we have to consider how many full hundreds there are and the remaining pages. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 each. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For the tens digit 4, that's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50. Total 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. So in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So 4's are one more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and before that, it's 0,1,2,3, which don't include 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit concerned because the hundreds place for 4's is 89, which seems high. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. Each of these pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's, which seems correct because in the last partial hundred (401-488), 4's in tens place appeared 10 times (440-449) and 8's appeared 9 times (480-488). So, 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10=50, and 8's:4*10 +9=49.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so that's fine.\n\nSo adding up, 4's: 49+50+89=188, and 8's:49+49+0=98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? Because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount. For the tens place, in each full hundred, 4's and 8's each appear 10 times in the tens place. So for 4 full hundreds, that's 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, adding to the 40 each from the full hundreds, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Each full group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 full groups, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total 49 each. That seems right.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nFor the units place:\nNumber of 4's = number of complete decades (48) *1 +1 (from 484)=49\nNumber of 8's = number of complete decades (48)*1 +1 (from 488)=49\n\nFor the tens place:\nNumber of 4's = number of complete centuries (4) *10 +10 (from 440-449)=50\nNumber of 8's = number of complete centuries (4)*10 +9 (from 480-488)=49\n\nFor the hundreds place:\nNumber of 4's= number of pages from 400-488=89\nNumber of 8's=0\n\nSo, adding up, same as before: 49+50+89=188 and 49+49+0=98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So that's correct. 488-400=88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 89 pages.\n\nAnother way to check: 488 pages. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, maybe I should check if I'm counting correctly for the tens place in the last partial hundred. Let me list the tens digits from 401 to 488.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420: tens digit1\n421-430:2\n431-440:3\n441-450:4\n451-460:5\n461-470:6\n471-480:7\n481-490:8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nWait, so in the tens place from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, that's 10 pages, so 10 times. How about 8? From 480-488, that's 9 pages, so 9 times. So that's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the tens place for 4's is 10 and for 8's is 9 in the last partial hundred. So, 4's in tens place:40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place.\n   - Number of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each group contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n   - Number of complete hundreds: 4 (since 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88).\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 440-449: 10 4's.\n     - 480-488: 9 8's.\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-399: Hundreds digit is 0, 1, 2, or 3, none are 4 or 8.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately because each digit can vary from 0 to 9, right?\n\nSo, for a 488-page book, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Let me think about how the digits are distributed in each position. I think it's best to handle each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, each digit appears once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the number of 8's would also be 48. But wait, I also have those extra 8 numbers from 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in that range: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So here, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that to the units place count, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's interesting, they're equal in the units place.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me double-check. Each complete block of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 blocks would give 48 each. Then the last partial block from 481 to 488 has 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds do we have? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. Let's look at the tens digits here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. So, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, which would be tens digit 8, but wait, 488 is the last page, so actually, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 numbers (481-488). So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this last partial hundred?\n\nLooking at the tens digit in 401-488: The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. So, from 440 to 449, that's 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here. Wait, but 488 is 4-8-8, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this partial hundred. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 is included? Wait, no, the pages are 401-488, so 480 is within that range. So, from 480-488, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480 is page 480, so 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480 is included, so 9 pages with tens digit 8.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digit 8 would be in 481-488, which is 8 pages, but actually, 480 is also part of the 401-488 range, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480, making it 9 pages. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, 401-488: 488 - 400 = 88 pages. So, 401 is the first page, 401 being 4-0-1. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Therefore, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and the digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, no, wait: The 4*10 is from the four complete hundreds (each contributing 10 4's in the tens place). Then, in the partial hundred, 440-449 adds another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10 = 40. Then, in the partial hundred, 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4's:50 and 8's:49. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the units place they were equal, so 49 each. So, let me confirm that again.\n\nWait, in the units place, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 4 (at 484) and 1 8 (at 488). So, total units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4's, and 48 +1=49 for 8's. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nIn the tens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, the last partial hundred (401-488) has 440-449 contributing 10 4's and 480-488 contributing 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49. So, in tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, which start from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 -400 +1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from the complete hundreds, 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 adds 10 4's in the tens place, making it 50 for 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's in the tens place, making it 49 for 8's. So, tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nUnits place:49 each.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check each step again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 complete blocks of 10:48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Last 8 pages:481-488, units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units:48+1=49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 complete hundreds: each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each.\n- Partial hundred (401-488):\n  - 440-449:10 4's in tens place.\n  - 480-488:9 8's in tens place.\nSo, total tens place:40+10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488:89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately, we determine that 4 appears 90 more times than 8.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for the digit 8 (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units digits: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49 (10 times) and 8 in 80-89 (10 times). So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, 4 complete hundreds give 4*10 = 40 for each digit. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4's add 10 and 8's add 9. So, total tens digits: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each 10 pages contain one 4 and one 8.\n- 48 complete sets of 10 pages: 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages (481-488): one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds: 40 each.\n- Last 88 pages (401-488): 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 does not appear here.\n- Total 4's: 89.\n- Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is either a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Maybe I can count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be the number of complete blocks of 10 in 488, which is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks). But wait, actually, each block contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. However, since 488 is not a multiple of 10, there's an extra part after the 48th block. The last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So in the units place, the digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial block, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So total units place 4's: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so maybe the partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, so 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place in the partial block. So total units place 4's: 48*1 +1=49, same for 8's:49. So the count for units place is equal for both 4 and 8.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So for each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. Wait, no, in terms of hundreds, it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So in each full hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nNow, what about the partial hundred from 401 to 488? The tens digit here goes from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear? Let's see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0. 411-420, tens digit is 1. 421-430, tens digit is 2. 431-440, tens digit is 3. 441-450, tens digit is 4. 451-460, tens digit is 5. 461-470, tens digit is 6. 471-480, tens digit is 7. 481-488, tens digit is 8. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in this partial hundred? Only once, from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in the tens place from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers (481-488), so 8 times. Wait, but in the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in a full hundred, but in a partial hundred, it's different.\n\nWait, no, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10 except for the last one, which is 8. So for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (441-450). For 8 in the tens place, it's 8 times (481-488). So in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens place 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) +10=50. Tens place 8's:40 +8=48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check: the hundreds digit cycles every 100. So 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 or 1? Wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, so hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, right? Wait, no, page numbers are printed as one, two, or three digits. So page 1 is '1', page 10 is '10', page 100 is '100'. So the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times (since 488-400+1=89). 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4.\n\nSo total hundreds place 4's:89, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract total 8's from total 4's:188-97=91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in units place.\n- 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n- Then the partial block from 481-488 has 8 numbers, with units digits 1-8. So 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So units place:48*1 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred (100 pages) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n- The partial hundred (401-488) has tens digits from 0 to 8.\n- For 4 in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- For 8 in the tens place, it's from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n- So total tens place 4's:40+10=50, and 8's:40+8=48. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times.\n- That seems correct.\n\nAdding them up:\n4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nI think that's correct. So the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each full hundred (100 pages) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) contributes 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and similarly, the digit 8 appears once. But since the book has 488 pages, which is 48 full sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Wait, the remaining pages would be from 481 to 488. So, the units digits here are 1 through 8, so no extra 4's. So, total 4's in units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it's also 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra 8's in the last 8 pages. But again, the last 8 pages end at 8, so the units digit 8 appears once more at page 488. So, total 8's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, is that right? Let me check: from 1 to 480, each 10 pages contribute one 8, so 48 times, and then from 481 to 488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more, making it 49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, it cycles every 100 pages. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and 8 ten times (80-89). But since the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and so does 8. So, for 400 pages, that's 4 times 10 for 4's, which is 40, and similarly 40 for 8's.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be considered. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 times. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? From 480-488, that's 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, right? So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would only appear if there were pages beyond 800, but since the book is only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nNow, let me sum up the totals for each digit.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so I subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n- For 488 pages, units digit cycles every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, no additional 4's, but one 8 at 488. So, units 4's: 48, units 8's: 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 400 pages would have 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0 to 8. The 4's in the tens place occur in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. The 8's in the tens place occur in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 89 seems like a large number, but maybe that's correct. Let me think again. Each time the 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant contribution. The 8's don't have any hundreds, so that's why the difference is so large.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for the remaining pages. Let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I count the 4's in the tens place, I have 40 from the first 400 pages and 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, 40 from the first 400 pages and 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages contain 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one additional 8 (at page 488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 400 pages contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear from page 400 to 488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits separately, like the units place and the tens place. So, for each page number, there's a ones digit and a tens digit, right? For example, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', so the tens digit is 1 and the ones digit is 0. But in a 488-page book, the page numbers go up to 488, so I might have three-digit page numbers from page 100 onwards. So, maybe I should consider three-digit numbers, with hundreds, tens, and ones places. But wait, page numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, from 10 to 99 are two-digit, and from 100 to 488 are three-digit. So perhaps I should handle each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of times the digit 4 appears in each place. Maybe I can do the same for 8 and then subtract the two totals to find the difference. So, I'll need to count how many 4's are in the ones place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the ones place: For every group of ten pages, the ones digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the ones place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, with 8 pages remaining. So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 4 and one 8 in the ones place. That gives 48 4's and 48 8's from the ones place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the ones digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the ones place, there's one more 4 and one more 8. So, total 4's in the ones place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so they're equal in the ones place? Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten pages. So, for example, from 10 to 19, the tens digit is 1; from 20 to 29, it's 2, and so on. Each time the tens digit is 4, it's from 40 to 49, which is ten pages. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 80 to 89, another ten pages. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? Well, in the range 1-488, how many full decades are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds, but wait, actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 0-99, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 times. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Let's count. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 pages. Then 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Then 480-488: that's 9 pages. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. So, 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. So, that's a difference. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, that's 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. But 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: ones place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, for 8's: ones place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's minus the number of 8's is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I miscounted in the tens place or somewhere else.\n\nStarting with the ones place: Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8. 488 pages mean 48 full groups (48*10=480) plus 8 pages. So, 48 groups give 48 4's and 48 8's. The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have ones digits 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, total ones place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 4, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 pages, so 5 sets, totaling 50 times. For 8, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four is 10 pages, so 4*10=40, and 480-488 is 9 pages, so total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 50 vs. 49, so 1 more 4 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49 (ones) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (ones) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, yes, 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Ones Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full groups (480 pages) plus 8 additional pages.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 (5 sets of 10, totaling 50).\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 (4 sets of 10 and 9 pages, totaling 49).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (ones) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (ones) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I can analyze the occurrence of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So for the units place, from page 1 to page 488, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nWait, but page 1 is page 1, so does that mean the units digit starts at 1? Hmm, but in terms of counting, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be the total number of pages divided by 10, rounded down, but I need to check if 488 is included.\n\nLet me calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place. The total number of pages is 488, so how many complete sets of 10 are there? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, each set of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place, so that would be 48 times. However, I think I need to check if the last partial set (pages 481-488) includes another 4 in the units place. Page 484 would be the 4 in the units place in that last set. So that adds one more, making it 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, each set of 10 contributes one 8. So again, 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, and then checking the last partial set, which includes page 488. So that's 48 times plus one more in the last set, totaling 49 times. Wait, but that would mean the number of 4's and 8's in the units place is the same, which is 49 each. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: For every 10 pages, there's one 4. So from 1 to 488, how many 4's? It's the number of times 4 appears in the units digit. The formula would be floor(488/10) = 48, and then check if the remainder is greater than or equal to 4. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 if 48*10 + 4 <=488, which it is (484). So 48 +1 =49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: floor(488/10)=48, and the remainder is 8, which is >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSo both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Here, each digit in the tens place cycles every 100 pages. So for each block of 100 pages, the digit in the tens place is the same for 10 consecutive pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 10 pages, 1 for 10, etc., up to 9 for 10 pages.\n\nSo for the digit 4 in the tens place: Each occurrence is 10 pages. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488?\n\nWell, in each 100 pages, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 pages: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\nSo the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is the number of complete 100s multiplied by 10, plus any extra in the last partial 100.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that adds 10 more.\n\nSo total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: Each 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears in the tens place for pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, not 10. Wait, that's a mistake. Because from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So for 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, not 10. So in the last partial hundred, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in tens place: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So for each tens digit, it's 10 pages except for the last one, which is only 9 pages (480-488). So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo 4's in tens place: 50, 8's in tens place:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit represents 100 pages. So for 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nWait, actually, page 1 is 001, but maybe we don't consider leading zeros. So the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, etc.\n\nSo for 4's in the hundreds place: It occurs in pages 400-488. So that's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: Since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest is 4, so 8's in the hundreds place occur 0 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So 8's in the hundreds place never occur. So 0 times.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each. That seems correct because from 1 to 488, each digit from 0-9 appears the same number of times in the units place, except possibly the last digit if it doesn't complete a full cycle.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, which ends with 8. So the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial set. So for units place, the number of 4's is 48 full sets (each contributing one 4) plus one more in the last set (page 484), so 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 full sets plus one in the last set (page 488), so 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: 4's are 50, 8's are 49. Let me check again.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So 4 hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So total 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 8. So 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4's occur from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So 89 times. 8's in hundreds place: 0 times, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When calculating the hundreds place for 4's, is it 89 pages? Let me confirm. From page 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So yes, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in hundreds place, it's 0.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again. For units place, the number of 4's is calculated as floor(488/10)=48, and then check if the remainder is >=4. The remainder is 8, which is >=4, so add 1, making it 49. Similarly for 8's, floor(488/10)=48, and remainder is 8, which is >=8, so add 1, making it 49. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to calculate units digits is to consider that for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, but that might not be accurate because if d is 0, it's different, but since we're starting from 1, maybe it's better to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps a better formula is: For units digit d, the count is (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0), but adjusted because when n is less than 10, we have to handle it differently. But in this case, n is 488, so it's okay.\n\nWait, let me test this formula with d=4.\n\nn=488, so 488//10=48, and 488%10=8. Since 8 >=4, add 1. So 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for d=8: 488//10=48, 488%10=8 >=8, so 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but maybe I should check if 488 is included. Yes, 488 is included, so 488-400+1=89.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as 488 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, I think the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 10 pages contribute one 4. There are 48 full sets of 10 pages, plus an additional 4 in the last set (page 484), totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, each 10 pages contribute one 8, with an additional 8 in the last set (page 488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred (440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each 100 pages have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred (480-488), totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occurs 89 times from page 400 to 488.\n   - **8's:** Never occurs as the book ends at 488.\n\nSumming these:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds. That might make it easier to count the occurrences of each digit.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every ten pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, for example, from page 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same. \n\nWait, but the book has 488 pages, so the total number of pages is 488. That means the units digit cycles 48 times (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, actually, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). So, in the units place, how many 4's and 8's do we have? For each complete set of ten, we have one 4 and one 8. So, 48 sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, we have one more 4 (page 484) and one more 8 (page 488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every ten pages. So, for example, from 1-10, the tens digit is 0, 11-20 it's 1, and so on. So, each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from page 40-49, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. Similarly, for 8, it's from 80-89, another 10 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, so the tens digit goes up to 8 in the last set (480-489). But since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, actually, from 480-489 is 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so the tens digit 8 in the last partial set is 9 pages? Hmm, no, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, the tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, for pages 40-49, it's 4; 50-59, 5; and so on. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every hundred pages. So, in 488 pages, how many hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), we need to check the tens digits. Let's break it down:\n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0 (pages 401-410, but wait, 401-410 would be 10 pages, but 401-409 is 9 pages. Wait, no, 401-410 would have tens digit 0 for 401-410, but since we're only going up to 488, let me check.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the tens digit for each hundred. So, in 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 9 times because we stop at 488. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial set.\n\nWait, but actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? From 401-410, tens digit 0 appears 10 times. From 411-420, tens digit 1 appears 10 times, and so on, up to 480-488, which is 9 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 4, which is from 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding to the previous 40 each from the first 400 pages, the total for the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in the first 400 pages, each hundred had 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then in the last 88 pages, 440-449 adds another 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then in the last 88 pages, 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8. So, units:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. Correct.\n\nTens place: First 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449) and 8 for 9 pages (480-488). So, 4's in tens place:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 pages in 480 pages, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (page 484) and one '8' (page 488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages in the tens place.\n   - In the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's, totaling 40 each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) have:\n     - 10 '4's in the tens place (pages 440-449).\n     - 9 '8's in the tens place (pages 480-488).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is '4' for pages 400-488, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - The hundreds digit '8' never appears.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's than '8's in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are 1-9 (one-digit), 10-99 (two-digit), 100-488 (three-digit). Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place\u2014units, tens, and hundreds\u2014since a 4 can appear in any of these places. Similarly, I'll do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n1. Units place: In the units digit, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, like 4,14,24,... up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 times. But wait, 48*10 is 480, so the next 4 would be at 484, which is within 488. So, 48 times? Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) plus an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full cycle of 10, there's one 4, so 48 times. But in the last partial cycle, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, let me think again. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (sets of 10) plus any extra in the last incomplete decade. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, in the tens digit, 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many hundreds are there. 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so from 400-488. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, from 400-409: tens digit is 0, 410-419: 1, ..., 440-449: 4, which is 10 numbers. Then 450-459:5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, in the hundreds place, it's 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, but the last hundred only contributes 10 times as well, because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, total tens place 4's: 4 * 10 = 40, but wait, no, actually, it's 4 hundreds, but each hundred has one set where the tens digit is 4, so 4 times 10 = 40. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, it's 10 times, and there are 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, 488 is 4 full hundreds? Wait, 1-99 is the first hundred, 100-199 the second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 is the fifth, but only up to 488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. In the fifth hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449). So total tens place 4's: 5 * 10 = 50? Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the fifth hundred is only up to 488, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is within 400-488. So, yes, 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is only 488 pages, so the hundreds go up to 400-488, which is the fifth hundred? Wait, no, 1-99 is first hundred, 100-199 second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 is the fifth hundred, but only up to 488. So, in each of these five hundreds, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so in the fifth hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-99: 40-49: 10 times. From 100-199:140-149:10 times. From 200-299:240-249:10 times. From 300-399:340-349:10 times. From 400-488:440-449:10 times. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. So, tens place 4's:50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, in the hundreds digit, 4 appears in all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, hundreds place 4's:89.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nWait, but let me verify that. Units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with 8's:\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total units place 8's:48 +1=49.\n\n2. Tens place: 8 appears in the tens digit in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nEach hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 0-99:80-89:10 times. From 100-199:180-189:10 times. From 200-299:280-289:10 times. From 300-399:380-389:10 times. From 400-488:480-488:9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four hundreds, and 9 times in the fifth hundred (400-488). So, total tens place 8's:4*10 +9=40+9=49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-99:80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: 8 appears in the hundreds digit only in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's)=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me make sure I didn't overcount or undercount anywhere.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I considered 5 sets of 10, which gave me 50. But is that accurate? Let's see: from 1-99, 40-49:10. 100-199:140-149:10. 200-299:240-249:10. 300-399:340-349:10. 400-488:440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, from 1-99:80-89:10. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4's and 8's:49 each, which seems correct as 48 full decades plus one extra in the last partial decade.\n\nHundreds place for 4's:89, because from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's:0, since the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. Difference:90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 4's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10=484. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10=488. So, (n-1)*10=480, so n=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately because the number of 4's and 8's can appear in either. \n\nLet me start by considering the units digit. For every set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each of these sets, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.).

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks of ten pages each, and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, so 488-480=8). So in each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units digit. \n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages beyond the 480th page, which are pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So in these 8 pages, the units digit is 4 in page 484 and 8 in page 488. So that's one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. \n\nSo total units digit 4's: 48 (from the blocks) + 1 (from the extra pages) = 49. Similarly, units digit 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times. \n\nNow, I should check the tens digit. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So for example, in 48, the tens digit is 4, and in 84, the tens digit is 8. \n\nLet me figure out how often each digit appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So in each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So for example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. \n\nWait, but our book only goes up to 488 pages, so we have to consider how many complete hundreds there are and then the remaining pages. \n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So let me break it down:\n\n1. Pages 1-99: Tens digits cycle 0-9 ten times each. So for each digit in the tens place, including 4 and 8, they each appear 10 times. So 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\n2. Pages 100-199: Similarly, the tens digits cycle 0-9 ten times each. So again, 4 appears 10 times (140-149) and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). \n\n3. Pages 200-299: Same pattern, 4 appears 10 times (240-249) and 8 appears 10 times (280-289). \n\n4. Pages 300-399: 4 appears 10 times (340-349) and 8 appears 10 times (380-389). \n\n5. Pages 400-488: Now, this is where it might be different because we don't go up to 499. Let's see, the tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, but how many times does each tens digit appear here? Let's see:\n\n- For tens digit 0: pages 400-409, that's 10 pages.\n- For tens digit 1: 410-419, 10 pages.\n- Similarly, up to tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times here.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me check: from 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each tens digit except for 8 has 10 pages. The tens digit 8 would be from 480 to 489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 pages (480-488). So in the tens place, digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480 is the first page with tens digit 8, and 488 is the last. So pages 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So yes, 9 times for digit 8 in the tens place in the 400-488 range.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 4 in the tens place, how many times does it appear in 400-488? The tens digit 4 would be in pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So 10 times.\n\nSo putting it all together for the tens digit:\n\n- Pages 1-99: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Pages 100-199: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Pages 200-299: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Pages 300-399: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Pages 400-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo total for tens digit:\n- 4's: 10 (from 1-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me add it up again: 10+10+10+10+10 = 50 for 4's, and 10+10+10+10+9=49 for 8's. So in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, combining both the units and tens digits:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n- Tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 = 99.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 99 4's and 98 8's. So the difference is 99 - 98 = 1. So there is one more 4 than 8.\n\nBut wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 pages contributes 1 4 and 1 8 in the units digit. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages), so 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have a 4 in 484 and an 8 in 488, so that's 1 more 4 and 1 more 8. So total units digits: 49 4's and 49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same with 8. So from 1-399, that's 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nThen, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's.\n\nSo total tens digits: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 99 - 98 = 1.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds digit could also contribute, but in this case, the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. So the hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488, but that's the hundreds digit, not the tens or units. So we don't have to consider the hundreds digit for 4's and 8's because 488 is the last page, and the hundreds digit doesn't affect the count of 4's and 8's in the tens and units places. So I think my calculation is correct.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm: in the hundreds place, does the digit 4 appear? Yes, in pages 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. But since we're only counting the digits 4 and 8 in the units and tens places, the hundreds digit doesn't contribute to the count of 4's and 8's in the units or tens. So that's fine.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total number of 4's is 99 and 8's is 98, so there's one more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I should think about each digit place separately and count them again.\n\nStarting with units digit:\n\n- For each ten pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n- Number of complete tens in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens).\n- Each contributes 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488, units digits 1-8. So 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units: 48 +1 =49 for 4's, 48 +1=49 for 8's.\n\nTens digit:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 10 times per hundred.\n- Similarly, 10 times per hundred for 8's.\n- From 1-399: 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's.\n- From 400-488: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 pages), so 10 more 4's.\n- Tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's.\n- Total tens digits: 40 +10=50 4's, 40 +9=49 8's.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\n- Only contributes to 4's, but since we're not counting hundreds digit, it doesn't affect the count of 4's and 8's in units or tens.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) =99.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference: 99-98=1.\n\nWait, so the answer is 1 more 4 than 8. But I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try a different approach, maybe by actually counting the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nAlternatively, I can write a small table to count how many times each digit appears in the units and tens places.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, that's not exactly right because it's more about how many times 4 appears in the units digit.\n\nWait, actually, in the units digit, for every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) + (if the units digit of 488 is >=4, add 1). So floor(488/10)=48. Since 488's units digit is 8, which is >=4, so add 1. So total 48 +1=49. Similarly for 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since units digit is 8, which is >=8, so add 1. So 48 +1=49. That matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the tens place, it's similar. The number of times a digit appears in the tens place is calculated by considering how many complete groups of 100 there are, and then the remainder.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to number N is:\n\nnumber = floor((N / 100) * 10) + min(max(N % 100 - d*10 +1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, that might be a bit complex, but let me try applying it.\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place up to 488:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488 / 100) =4 (since 4*100=400, 5*100=500 which is beyond 488).\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 488 - 4*100=88.\n\nSo we look at the tens digit in the remaining 88 pages. The digit we're looking for is 4, so we see if the tens digit in 88 is >=4.\n\nThe tens digit in 88 is 8, which is >=4, so the number of times 4 appears in the tens place in the remaining part is min(88 - 4*10 +1, 10). Wait, that might not be the right way.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that in the last partial hundred (88 pages), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 88 is 8 tens and 8 units). So the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49 in this partial hundred, which is 10 pages (40-49). But wait, 40-49 is within 0-88? No, because 40-49 is within 0-99, but our remaining is up to 88. So in the last partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears from 40-49, which is 10 pages. So we add 10 to the total.\n\nWait, but that would make it 40 +10=50, which matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining 88 pages: the tens digit 8 appears from 80-88, which is 9 pages (80-88). So we add 9 to the total, making it 40 +9=49.\n\nSo that confirms that in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nSo adding up units and tens:\n\n4's:49 +50=99\n8's:49 +49=98\n\nDifference:99-98=1.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially with the last partial group, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me try another approach: manually counting for a smaller number to see if the method works.\n\nSuppose I have a 28-page book. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each 10 pages: 4 and 8 each once.\n- 28/10=2 full tens, so 2 4's and 2 8's.\n- Remaining 8 pages: pages 21-28. Units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (24), 8 appears once (28).\n- Total units:2+1=3 4's, 2+1=3 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Pages 1-9: no tens digit, so 0.\n- Pages 10-19: tens digit 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 20-28: tens digit 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- So total tens digits:0 4's and 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:3, 8's:3. Difference:0.\n\nBut wait, in reality, in 28 pages, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nLooking at page numbers:\n\nUnits digits: 4 appears at 4,14,24; 8 at 8,18,28. So 3 each.\n\nTens digits: 4 doesn't appear in tens place because the highest tens digit is 2 (pages 20-28). So 0.\n\nSo total 4's:3, 8's:3. Difference:0. Which matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but according to our formula earlier, for units digit in 28:\n\nfloor(28/10)=2, and since 28's units digit is 8 >=4, add 1. So 2+1=3 4's.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: floor(28/10)=2, and since 8>=8, add 1:3 8's.\n\nTens digit: for 4, floor(28/100)=0, so 0*10=0. The remaining 28: the tens digit 4 would be from 40-49, but since 28 <40, it's 0. So total 0.\n\nSimilarly for 8: same logic, 0.\n\nSo yes, the formula works.\n\nAnother test: 50 pages.\n\nUnits digits: 50/10=5, 5 4's and 5 8's. Since 50's units digit is 0, which is <4 and <8, so no addition. So 5 each.\n\nTens digits:\n\nFor 4: floor(50/100)=0, remaining 50. The tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 pages. So 10 4's.\n\nFor 8: floor(50/100)=0, remaining 50. The tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, but since 50 <80, it's 0. So 0 8's.\n\nWait, but in reality, in 50 pages, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. The tens digit 8 doesn't appear because the book ends at 50, so 0 8's.\n\nSo total 4's:5 (units) +10 (tens)=15.\nTotal 8's:5 (units) +0 (tens)=5.\nDifference:10.\n\nWhich is correct because in 50 pages, 4's in units:5, tens:10; 8's:5.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nTherefore, going back to the original problem, the calculation seems correct. So the difference is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me check one more time. Maybe I should consider the hundreds digit for 4's, but no, the problem is about the digits printed, not the hundreds digit. So the hundreds digit is 4 only in pages 400-488, but that's the hundreds place, which we're not counting for 4's and 8's. So the count remains as 99 4's and 98 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because when I think about the tens digit in 400-488, the 4 in the tens place is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's, and 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So that adds correctly.\n\nYes, I think I've double-checked enough. So the answer should be that there is one more 4 than 8.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the units and tens digits separately.\n\n**Units Digit Analysis:**\n- Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- There are 48 full blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- **Total units digit 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **Total units digit 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Digit Analysis:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- For pages 1-399, there are 4 hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n- Pages 400-488 contribute 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n- **Total tens digit 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **Total tens digit 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 99 - 98 = 1\n\n**Answer:** There is one more 4 printed than 8's.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1}."

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then add them up.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, in every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and so does the digit 8. But wait, the book has 488 pages, so the last set might not be complete. Let me check how many complete sets of ten there are.\n\nTotal pages are 488, so the number of complete sets of ten is 48 full sets (since 48*10=480), and then there's a partial set from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, for the units place, in each of the 48 complete sets, 4 and 8 each appear once. So that's 48 times each. Then, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial set, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. So, units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). \n\nSo, for the tens place, let's see how many hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410, but wait, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, let's see: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times for 4. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the partial hundred. \n\nSo, total for tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. That means 4 has one more in the tens place than 8.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4, right? So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest page is 488, which is 4 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units total is 49 each. That seems right.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 for each digit 4 and 8. So, 4 full hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4.\n\nFor 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each set of 100 pages has 10 pages with 4 in the tens place (40-49) and 10 with 8 (80-89).\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488 add 10 more 4's (440-449) and 9 more 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nMaybe I should count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's consider each position one by one.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, every 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? We have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers are there? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nAdding them up, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, that's 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (at 488). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens place, every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 times. So total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check each part.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one with 4 in units, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10, so +10, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so +89. Total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 488 has 8 in units, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in tens, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0. So total 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (480 occurrences) + 1 in the last partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 occurrences) + 10 in the last partial hundred = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences from 400-488.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of 10 (48 occurrences) + 1 in the last partial group = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (40 occurrences) + 9 in the last partial hundred = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how many digits are in the page numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): Here, the digits are just 1 through 9. So, the digit 4 appears once (on page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (on page 8). So, for single-digit pages, the count is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, two-digit pages (10-99): Now, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers (10-99):\n- The tens digit can be from 1 to 9.\n- For 4's in the tens place: When the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4.\n- For 8's in the tens place: Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89. That's another 10 occurrences of 8.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers (10-99):\n- The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit.\n- For 4's in the units place: For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets (10-99), so 9 occurrences of 4.\n- Similarly, for 8's in the units place: Also 9 occurrences, one in each set of ten.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, for each digit (4 and 8), in the units place, it's 9 times each.\n\nSo, total for two-digit pages:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought single-digit pages had 1 each, and two-digit pages might have more. But wait, let me check: for two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4 is 40-49, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. The units place for 4 is 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 times, so 9 4's. So total 19 4's in two-digit pages. Similarly, 8's in tens place: 80-89, 10 8's. Units place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 8's. So total 19 8's in two-digit pages.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: 100-488. These are from 100 up to 488, which is 389 pages. Wait, 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages. Hmm, but maybe I should break this down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nLet me consider each digit place separately for three-digit numbers.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since we're going up to 488. So, 100-199: hundreds digit is 1; 200-299: 2; 300-399:3; 400-488:4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n- How many times does 4 appear? Only in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, tens place in three-digit numbers (100-488):\n- The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. But since we go up to 488, the last hundred (400-488) only goes up to 8 in the tens place (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (for 400-488, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, ..., 8 in 480-488). So, for each hundred except the last one, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9, but for the last hundred (400-488), it only goes up to 8.\n\nWait, no, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we're stopping at 488, the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8 (for 400-488). So, for the tens place in three-digit numbers, let's calculate 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for 4's in the tens place:\n- For hundreds = 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\n- For hundreds = 4: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, 10 more 4's in the tens place. So total 30 + 10 = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place:\n- For hundreds = 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\n- For hundreds = 4: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, 9 8's in the tens place. So total 30 + 9 = 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 9 8's in the tens place for the hundreds=4 case.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers (100-488):\nFor 4's in the units place:\n- For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), in each ten's group (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, in each ten's group, the units digit is 4 once. \n\nSo, for hundreds=1,2,3: Each hundred has 10 ten's groups, each contributing 1 4 in the units place. So, 10 \u00d7 1 = 10 per hundred, times 3 hundreds: 3\u00d710=30.\n\nFor hundreds=4: The range is 400-488. How many ten's groups are there? From 400-409 (tens=0), 410-419 (tens=1), ..., 480-488 (tens=8). So, 9 ten's groups. Each contributes 1 4 in the units place, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Wait, 480-488 is a full ten's group? No, 480-489 would be a full group, but we stop at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the units digit 4 would occur at 484. So, yes, in each ten's group, the units digit 4 occurs once. So, 9 ten's groups, each contributing 1 4 in the units place, so 9.\n\nSo total 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: For hundreds=4, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nFor 8's in the units place:\nSimilarly, for hundreds=1,2,3: Each hundred has 10 ten's groups, each contributing 1 8 in the units place. So, 10 per hundred, times 3: 3\u00d710=30.\n\nFor hundreds=4: The range is 400-488. The units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times, same as 4's. So, 9 8's in the units place for hundreds=4.\n\nSo total 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me make sure: For hundreds=4, the units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,...,488, which is 9 times because from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-8 in the last group, so yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, let's summarize the three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- 4's in tens place: 40\n- 4's in units place: 39\nTotal 4's in three-digit pages: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0\n- 8's in tens place: 39\n- 8's in units place: 39\nTotal 8's in three-digit pages: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, but let me check: For 8's in the tens place, I had 30 from hundreds=1,2,3 and 9 from hundreds=4, totaling 39. Similarly, for units place, 30 + 9 = 39. So, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's and 8's from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit pages.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nStarting with 4's in three-digit pages:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n- Tens place: For hundreds=1,2,3: each has 10 4's in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds=4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So total 30 + 10 = 40.\n- Units place: For hundreds=1,2,3: each has 10 ten's groups, each contributing 1 4, so 10\u00d73=30. For hundreds=4: 9 ten's groups, each contributing 1 4, so 9. Total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's in three-digit pages. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit pages:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: For hundreds=1,2,3: each has 10 8's in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds=4: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total 30 + 9 = 39.\n- Units place: For hundreds=1,2,3: each has 10 8's in the units place, so 3\u00d710=30. For hundreds=4: 408,418,...,488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78 8's in three-digit pages. That seems correct.\n\nNow, adding up all 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nAll 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that in three-digit pages, the 8's in the units place for hundreds=4 was 9, but let me check: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in hundreds=4, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if 488 is included in both tens and units places. 488 has an 8 in both tens and units, so it's counted twice, which is correct because each digit is counted separately.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, you have to consider if the range is inclusive or exclusive, especially for the last hundred. Let me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nFor hundreds=4, the range is 400-488.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n- Tens place: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Correct.\n- Units place: 404,414,...,484 is 9 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Tens place: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Correct.\n- Units place: 408,418,...,488 is 9 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, all counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit pages:\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - **Units place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times (104, 114, ..., 484).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (108, 118, ..., 488).\n   - Total for three-digit pages:\n     - 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n     - 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each place. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many times does this happen? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, it's 48 full tens. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 484 would have a 4 in the units place, making it 49 times in total for the units place. Hmm, maybe I should check that again. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but since the last page is 488, which is 48*10 + 8, so the units digit 4 appears 48 times from 4 to 484, stepping by 10 each time. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so it's 48 times. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, 48 times. So units place 4's: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. So, for example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4*10 = 40. But wait, the last hundred is 400-488, which is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. So tens place 4's: 40.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88, plus 89 is 177. So 177 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many times? 488 // 10 = 48, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal to 8, so does that mean we include the 488th page? Wait, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's the 49th occurrence. So units place 8's: 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, for 10 consecutive numbers. So 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are in 488 pages? 488 // 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but for 8's, it's 0. So total 4's are 177, and 8's are 98. So the difference would be 177 - 98 = 79.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then the 49th would be at 484, which is within 488, so yes, 49 times. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now I'm getting 49. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's list some examples: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, common difference 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units place 4's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is within 488. So number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So units place 8's: 49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 4's in units place were 48, but it's actually 49. That changes things.\n\nSo let's recalculate:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, and how many blocks are there? From 0-488, there are 5 blocks where the tens digit is 4: 0-99 (40-49), 100-199 (140-149), 200-299 (240-249), 300-399 (340-349), and 400-488 (440-449). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but that's because I considered only up to 400-488 as the fourth block, but actually, 400-488 includes another block 440-449. So tens place 4's: 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is the fifth block, right? Because 0-99 is first, 100-199 second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 fifth. So each of these five blocks has a 4 in the tens place for 10 numbers. So 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 50 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So I think I made a mistake earlier by only considering 4 full hundreds for the tens place. Actually, it's 5 blocks because 400-488 is the fifth block, so 5*10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49 as before.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 8's except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So number of blocks: 5. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the fifth contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo now, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier calculation. So I think I made a mistake in the initial count for the tens place of 4's. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, another approach: For each digit place, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: Numbers ending with 4: 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So 49 times.\n\nFor 8's: Numbers ending with 8: 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1)=488. So 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: Tens digit is 4. The numbers are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nFor 8's: Tens digit is 8. Numbers are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. First four blocks are 10 each, last block is 9. So 4*10 + 9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: Hundreds digit is 4. Numbers are 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nFor 8's: Hundreds digit is 8. Numbers would be 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, which is correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. So yes, 89.\n\nSo the difference is 90.\n\nBut wait, let me check the tens place again. For 4's, I have 5 blocks each contributing 10, so 50. For 8's, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, so 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers.\n\nAnother way: Let's calculate for each digit place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFor 4's: As above, 49.\n\nFor 8's: 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's: 50.\n\nFor 8's: 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4's: 89.\n\nFor 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. From 1 to 488, this happens 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks of 10 (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears 89 times.\n\n   **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488). The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No pages have '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n   **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the digits can be in the hundreds, tens, or units place.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position one by one. Maybe I can count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then checking if there's any remainder.\n\nBut wait, since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to adjust for that. So, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But then, there's an extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488). In these extra pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so each digit from 1 to 8 appears once more. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. The total number of units digits is 488. For the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, as 488 divided by 10 is 48.8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once more (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, not 9. So, maybe I should adjust my calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each digit place separately.\n\nLet's start with the units place. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as follows: For each digit d, the count is floor(total pages / 10) + (1 if d <= (total pages % 10) else 0). But since we're considering digits 4 and 8, let me apply this formula.\n\nFor the units place:\n- For digit 4: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Then, since 488 % 10 = 8, which is greater than 4, so we add 1. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- For digit 8: floor(488 / 10) = 48. Then, since 8 <= 8, we add 1. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was overcomplicating earlier.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for a book with 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Therefore, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8.\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages (4 hundreds), each digit 4 and 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is page 488, which is 48 in the tens place, but wait, 401-488 is actually 88 pages, so the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: in 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no 4's. In 411-420, tens digit is 1, no 4's. Similarly, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450:4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-488:8.\n\nWait, so in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears only once in the tens place: from 441-450, where the tens digit is 4. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so pages 401 to 488 inclusive. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but 441-450 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 pages. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n- Digit 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 from 401-488, so total 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 from 401-488, so total 48 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1,2,3, or 4. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188, and 8's are 97. So, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- For 488 pages, each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times in the units place, plus 1 if the digit is <=8 (since 488%10=8). So, digits 0-8 get an extra count, and 9 doesn't. So, for 4 and 8, both are <=8, so each gets 48 +1=49 in units place. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred, 10 times each digit. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, digit 4 appears in the tens place once (441-450, 10 pages), so 10 times, and digit 8 appears in the tens place once (481-488, 8 pages), so 8 times. So, total tens place for 4:40+10=50, for 8:40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- Digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. Digit 8 never appears here, so 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n- 8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles).\n   - For digits 4 and 8, since 488 % 10 = 8, each appears an additional time, totaling 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 appearances of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds give 40 appearances each for 4 and 8.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Digit 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- **4's**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's**: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference**: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has a single number, and each digit in that number is either a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times each digit appears in all the page numbers and then find the difference.\n\nMaybe I should start by counting the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically go through each place value and tally up the counts.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. For example, in 1-10, 4 is in 4 and 8 is in 8. This pattern repeats every ten numbers. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That would give 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. But wait, the last 8 pages (481-488) also include a 4 in 484 and an 8 in 488. So that adds one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So total units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nWait, no, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me think again. The first 480 pages would have 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this range, the units digits include 4 and 8. So that's one more 4 and one more 8. So total units digits: 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 +1 =49 eights. So units place gives equal counts for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle of 100 has ten numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49) and ten numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89). So in each hundred, there are 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages. So in each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit is 4 and 8 each appearing 10 times. So that's 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights from the tens place in the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, so no fours or eights there. Then from 410-419, the tens digit is 1, so again no fours or eights. Similarly, 420-429 have tens digit 2, 430-439 have 3, 440-449 have 4, 450-459 have 5, 460-469 have 6, 470-479 have 7, and 480-488 have 8.\n\nSo, in the tens place, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages, contributing 10 fours. And the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488). So that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo total tens place contributions: fours are 40 (from the complete hundreds) +10 (from 440-449) =50 fours. Eights are 40 (from complete hundreds) +9 (from 480-488) =49 eights.\n\nSo in the tens place, fours are 50 and eights are 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488, since the book has 488 pages. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From page 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about eights in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4 since the book is 488 pages. So the hundreds digit is never 8. So zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the counts:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours =49 +50 +89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights=49 +49 +0=98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have missed something.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 480-488, how many eights are there? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So in the tens place, eights are 40 (from 1-400) plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, fours are from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nUnits place: from 1-488, in each ten, 4 and 8 each appear once. So 48 complete tens give 48 each, and then 481-488 gives one more 4 and one more 8, so 49 each.\n\nSo adding up:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each set of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 480 pages, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each hundred contains ten numbers with tens digit 4 (40-49) and ten with 8 (80-89).\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - Pages 401-488: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, contributing 89 fours.\n   - No pages have hundreds digit 8.\n   - Total: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts**:\n- **4's**: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's**: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference**: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. Maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the totals to find the difference. That makes sense. So, I'll need to calculate how many 4's are in the units place, how many in the tens place, and how many in the hundreds place. Then I'll do the same for 8's and subtract.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once, and the same for 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that would be 48 times 1, which is 48 for 4's and 48 for 8's. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, adding those, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, yes, that's one more each. So, units place: 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, 488 is 4 hundreds plus 88 pages. So, let me correct that: 488 is 4 hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds plus 88 pages, but 488 is 400 + 88, so from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, and then 401-488 is 88 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see.\n\nIn each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on, up to 8 for 481-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see: the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10 times. Similarly, does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Yes, in 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the 401-488 range, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times. And 8 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 hundreds times 10 is 40 for 4's and 40 for 8's. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 4's total becomes 50. For 8's, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). So, 8's in tens place would be 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place: 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct because each set of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8, and the partial set adds one each.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. That's because in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, while 8 appears 9 times, so total 50 vs. 49.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's, which makes sense because the book only goes up to 488, so 4 is in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, each printed once. So, each digit in the page numbers can be looked at separately for the digits 4 and 8. Maybe I should count how many times 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's would be equal to the number of complete tens in 488. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete tens, which would mean 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Similarly, the same logic applies to 8's in the units place, so 48 occurrences of 8 as well.\n\nWait, but hold on. That might not be entirely accurate because 488 is not a multiple of 10. The last set would be 481-490, but since the book only goes up to 488, the units digit 8 would only appear once more in 488, right? So maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me recast this. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 each. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this range, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number so far.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, in 1-400, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place? Well, 400 divided by 100 is 4, so 4 times each. So, 4 appears 4*10=40 times, and 8 appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, so we have an extra 88 pages beyond 400. So, from 401 to 488, let's see how the tens digit behaves. The tens digit cycles every 100, so from 401-499, the tens digit would go through 0-9 ten times each. But since we only go up to 488, let's see how many complete tens we have.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and then 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears once, but each only for 10 numbers except the last one, which is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears once in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: the tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right. So, for numbers 481-488, the tens digit is 8, right? So, that's 8 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Similarly, in 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding that to the earlier count from 1-400, which was 40 times each, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check again. From 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times (4 times 10). Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go through 0-8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears once, each contributing 10 numbers, except the last one, which is 8, appearing 8 times. So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. For 8 in tens place, it's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times, so total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because from 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nEach of these blocks is 10 numbers except the last one, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears once in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. Therefore, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. So, total for 4 in tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nOkay, that seems right. Now, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, no, actually, page numbers start at 1, so from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- From 1-480: 48 sets of 10, so 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- From 481-488: 484 has a 4 in units, 488 has an 8. So, 49 4's and 49 8's. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400: 40 4's and 40 8's.\n- From 401-488: 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 8's. So, total 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 +50 +89=188\n8's total:49 +48 +0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - From 1 to 480: 48 occurrences of 4 and 48 of 8.\n   - From 481 to 488: 1 occurrence of 4 (484) and 1 of 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - From 1 to 400: 40 occurrences of each.\n   - From 401 to 488: 10 occurrences of 4 (441-450) and 8 occurrences of 8 (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **91**.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers. Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9). In this range, the digits are just 1 through 9. So, the only 4 is page 4, and the only 8 is page 8. That means there's one 4 and one 8 in the single-digit pages. So, the difference here is zero because they both occur once.\n\nNext, two-digit pages (10-99). Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, and each digit appears 10 times (for example, 10-19 have 1 in the tens place). So, for 4 in the tens place, that's pages 40-49, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is pages 80-89, another 10 pages. So, that's 10 fours and 10 eights.\n\nFor the units place: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, in each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, etc.) and 8 appears once (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 tens (10-99), each digit appears 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nWait, but hold on, from 10-99, the units digits go from 0-9 for each ten, so actually, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. But 0 doesn't count as a digit we're interested in, so for 4 and 8, it's 9 times each. So, in the units place, we have 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nAdding up the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: 10 fours (tens) + 9 fours (units) = 19 fours. Similarly, 10 eights (tens) + 9 eights (units) = 19 eights. So, in two-digit pages, the count is equal for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: 100-488. This is where it might get a bit more complicated because the numbers are longer, and we have hundreds, tens, and units places to consider. Let's break it down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488. So, 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nNow, let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, and 800 isn't part of it. So, in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each hundred block has 100 numbers, so each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred. But since our book ends at 488, the last hundred block is only up to 488, so we need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me think. For hundreds digits 1, 2, and 3, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 fully, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. But for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes from 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, for the tens place:\n\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n- For hundreds digit 4: The tens digit goes from 0-8, so 4 appears in the tens place in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is fully included. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so 440-449 is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for hundreds digit 4. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, for each of these three hundreds, that's 10 fours and 10 eights. So, total for hundreds digits 1-3: 3 * 10 = 30 fours and 30 eights.\n\nAdding the hundreds digit 4's tens place: 10 fours and 9 eights. So, total for tens place across all hundreds: 30 + 10 = 40 fours and 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles through 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundred block, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. But again, we need to consider if the book ends before a complete hundred.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred block has 100 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. So, for each of these hundreds, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times in the units place. So, for hundreds 1-3: 3 * 10 = 30 fours and 30 eights.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The numbers go from 400-488. So, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit. But since the last number is 488, we need to check if the units digit for tens digits beyond 8 is affected. Wait, no, because the tens digit in hundreds digit 4 goes up to 8 (as we saw earlier), but the units digit for each tens digit goes from 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's break it down:\n\nFor hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8. For each tens digit from 0-7, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times. But for tens digit 8, the units digit goes from 0-8, so digits 0-8 appear once, and 9 doesn't appear because 489 isn't in the book.\n\nSo, for the units place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears 10 times per tens digit, and 8 appears 10 times per tens digit. There are 8 tens digits (0-7), so 8 * 10 = 80 fours and 80 eights. Wait, no, that's not right because for each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so for each tens digit, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for 8 tens digits, that's 8 fours and 8 eights from each digit. Wait, no, no, wait. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so for each tens digit, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, for 8 tens digits (0-7), that's 8 fours and 8 eights.\n\nThen, for tens digit 8: The units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, that's 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nSo, total for hundreds digit 4 in units place: 8 fours + 1 four = 9 fours, and 8 eights + 1 eight = 9 eights.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. For each tens digit from 0-7, the units digit cycles 0-9, so for each tens digit, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for 8 tens digits, that's 8 fours and 8 eights. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total for units place in hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 fours and 8 + 1 = 9 eights.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because earlier I thought for each tens digit, units digits cycle through 0-9, so for each tens digit, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 8 tens digits would give 8 fours and 8 eights, and then the last tens digit (8) gives 1 four and 1 eight, totaling 9 fours and 9 eights. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, units place: 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all the units places:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1-3: 30 fours and 30 eights.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nTotal units place: 30 + 9 = 39 fours and 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought for hundreds digit 4, units place would have 9 fours and 9 eights, but when I add to the 30 fours and 30 eights from hundreds 1-3, that's 39 fours and 39 eights. Hmm, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place for hundreds digit 4. Let me try a different approach. For each number from 400-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nThe units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. For tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers, so 4 appears once per tens digit (e.g., 404, 414, etc.), and 8 appears once per tens digit (e.g., 408, 418, etc.). So, for 8 tens digits (0-7), that's 8 fours and 8 eights.\n\nThen, for tens digit 8, the units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for hundreds digit 4 in units place: 8 + 1 = 9 fours and 8 + 1 = 9 eights.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct. So, units place for hundreds digit 4: 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nAdding to the hundreds digits 1-3: 30 fours and 30 eights. So, total units place across all three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39 fours and 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nWait, but that seems like fours and eights are equal in units place, but I might have made a mistake because earlier I thought that in the units place, for hundreds digits 1-3, each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights, so 3 * 10 = 30 each. Then, for hundreds digit 4, units place contributes 9 fours and 9 eights. So, total units place: 39 fours and 39 eights. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the places for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n- Tens place: 40 fours, 39 eights.\n- Units place: 39 fours, 39 eights.\n\nWait, no, wait. Earlier, I calculated the tens place as 40 fours and 39 eights, and the units place as 39 fours and 39 eights. But let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, I think I might have confused the counts. Let me go back.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1-3: Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 3 * 10 = 30 fours and 30 eights.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Tens place contributes 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 fours and 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nIn the units place:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1-3: Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights, so 30 fours and 30 eights.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Units place contributes 9 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, total units place: 30 + 9 = 39 fours and 30 + 9 = 39 eights.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 4 contributes 89 fours, and no eights.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Fours: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168 fours.\n- Eights: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 0 + 39 = 39; 39 + 39 = 78 eights.\n\nWait, that seems off because in the tens place, we had 40 fours and 39 eights, and in the units place, 39 fours and 39 eights. So, adding up:\n\nFours in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 + 39 = 168 fours.\n\nEights in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 eights.\n\nNow, let's not forget the single-digit and two-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit (1-9):\n\n- 1 four (page 4)\n- 1 eight (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit (10-99):\n\n- 19 fours (10 in tens, 9 in units)\n- 19 eights (10 in tens, 9 in units)\n\nSo, adding up all ranges:\n\nFours:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188 fours.\n\nEights:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 188 fours minus 98 eights would be 90 more fours. But I think I might have made a mistake in the three-digit counts because when I added up the hundreds, tens, and units places, I might have miscounted.\n\nLet me double-check the three-digit counts.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Hundreds 1-3: Each has 10 fours and 10 eights in tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 fours and 30 eights.\n- Hundreds 4: Tens digits 0-8. For tens digits 0-7, each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights? Wait, no, in the tens place, for each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digits go from 0-8 because the book ends at 488. So, for tens digits 0-7, each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place? No, wait, in the tens place, for each hundreds digit, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times. But for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit only goes up to 8, so for tens digits 0-8, each appears how many times?\n\nWait, no, in the tens place, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8, but each tens digit from 0-8 appears how many times? For each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (except for the last one if the book ends early). Wait, no, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, but for each tens digit, how many numbers are there?\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 numbers (e.g., 400-409, 410-419, etc.), so each tens digit appears 10 times.\n- For tens digit 8: The numbers go from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each appears 10 times.\n- Tens digit 8: Appears 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Number of fours: For each tens digit, the digit in the tens place is 4 once per hundred, but wait, no. Wait, in the tens place, we're looking for when the tens digit is 4 or 8.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the digit in the tens place with the digit we're counting. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the tens place, we're looking for how many times 4 and 8 appear in that position across all three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8.\n\n- When the tens digit is 4: The numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- When the tens digit is 8: The numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 1-3, the tens digit can be 0-9, so for each hundreds digit, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) and the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1-3:\n\n- Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 fours and 30 eights.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 10 fours.\n- Tens digit 8: 9 eights.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n- Fours: 30 + 10 = 40.\n- Eights: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, units place:\n\nFor three-digit numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits.\n\nFor hundreds digits 1-3:\n\n- Each hundred block has 100 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So, 3 * 10 = 30 fours and 30 eights.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4:\n\n- The tens digits go from 0-8.\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 numbers, so the units digit cycles 0-9, meaning 4 and 8 each appear once per tens digit. So, 8 tens digits, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 8 fours and 8 eights.\n- For tens digit 8: The units digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, 1 four and 1 eight.\n\nSo, total for hundreds digit 4 in units place:\n\n- Fours: 8 + 1 = 9.\n- Eights: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nAdding to hundreds digits 1-3:\n\n- Fours: 30 + 9 = 39.\n- Eights: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, units place: 39 fours and 39 eights.\n\nNow, adding up all places for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n- Tens place: 40 fours, 39 eights.\n- Units place: 39 fours, 39 eights.\n\nTotal for three-digit numbers:\n\nFours: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nEights: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- Fours: 1.\n- Eights: 1.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Fours: 19.\n- Eights: 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Fours: 168.\n- Eights: 78.\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 four, 1 eight.\n\nTwo-digit: 19 fours, 19 eights.\n\nThree-digit: 168 fours, 78 eights.\n\nTotal fours: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total: 19 fours, 19 eights.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - Hundreds 1-3: 10 fours and 10 eights each, totaling 30 fours, 30 eights.\n     - Hundreds 4: 10 fours (440-449), 9 eights (480-488).\n     - Total: 40 fours, 39 eights.\n   - **Units place:** \n     - Hundreds 1-3: 10 fours and 10 eights each, totaling 30 fours, 30 eights.\n     - Hundreds 4: 9 fours, 9 eights.\n     - Total: 39 fours, 39 eights.\n   - **Total for three-digit numbers:** 168 fours, 78 eights.\n\n**Summing all ranges:**\n- **Total fours:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- **Total eights:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90 more fours.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract the two totals. But I need to make sure I count all occurrences, whether they're in the units place, tens place, or hundreds place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every group of ten pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, for example, in pages 1-10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. But in this case, we're looking for 4's and 8's. So in each set of ten pages, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 extra pages. So, for each complete set, that's 1 four and 1 eight in the units place. So, 48 sets would give 48 fours and 48 eights. \n\nBut wait, there are 8 extra pages after 480, which are pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in these. Page 484 has a 4 in the units place, and page 488 has an 8. So that adds one more 4 and one more 8 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and similarly, 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they're equal. But I think I might have made a mistake here because when I considered 488 pages, the number of sets of ten is 48, but the 49th set is from 481 to 490, but since we only go up to 488, we don't have a full set. So maybe I should think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate how many times each digit appears in each position separately. Let me try that approach.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each position, except possibly the last set if the total number isn't a multiple of 10. So, for 488 pages, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nThe number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages. So, for each digit, in the units place, it appears 48 times for each digit, and then in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, digits 1 through 8 each appear once more, and 9 and 0 don't appear in the extra pages.\n\nSo, for the digit 4, in the units place, it appears 48 times (from 1-480) plus once in 484, totaling 49 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times (from 1-480) plus once in 488, totaling 49 times. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, no difference here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Each digit appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages. For example, the digit 4 in the tens place would cover pages 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place up to page 488?\n\nLet's see. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nSo, in each of the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, except that in the first hundred (1-100), the tens digit for page 1 is 0, right? Wait, no, page 1 is 01? Wait, no, page numbers are 1-488, so pages 1-9 are single-digit, so their tens digit is 0. So, in the tens place, for pages 1-9, the tens digit is 0, and for pages 10-19, it's 1, and so on.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- Pages 1-9: tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 9 times (but we're not counting 0, so maybe we can ignore it for now).\n- Pages 10-19: tens digit is 1, appearing 10 times.\n- Pages 20-29: tens digit is 2, appearing 10 times.\n- ...\n- Pages 90-99: tens digit is 9, appearing 10 times.\n- Pages 100-109: tens digit is 0, appearing 10 times.\n- Pages 110-119: tens digit is 1, appearing 10 times.\n- And so on, up to page 488.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the digits 0-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400) and 88 pages (401-488).\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see what the tens digits are.\n\nPages 401-410: tens digit is 0, appearing 10 times (401-410).\nPages 411-420: tens digit is 1, appearing 10 times.\nPages 421-430: tens digit is 2, appearing 10 times.\nPages 431-440: tens digit is 3, appearing 10 times.\nPages 441-450: tens digit is 4, appearing 10 times.\nPages 451-460: tens digit is 5, appearing 10 times.\nPages 461-470: tens digit is 6, appearing 10 times.\nPages 471-480: tens digit is 7, appearing 10 times.\nPages 481-488: tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times (since 488 is the end).\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages, the digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 488 pages:\n\n- Digit 0: 40 (from first 400) + 10 (from 401-410) = 50 times.\n- Digit 1: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Digit 2: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Digit 3: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Digit 4: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Digit 5: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Digit 6: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Digit 7: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n- Digit 9: 40 times (since in 488 pages, we don't reach 490, so digit 9 in tens place doesn't appear in the last partial hundred).\n\nWait, but wait, in the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, in the next 88 pages, digits 0-7 appear 10 times each, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for digit 4, in the tens place, it's 40 + 10 = 50 times. Similarly, digit 8 in the tens place is 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 appears 2 more times in the tens place than 8.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, digits appear only from page 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're not counting 0. Then, from page 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times. From 200-299, it's 2, appearing 100 times. From 300-399, it's 3, appearing 100 times. From 400-488, it's 4, appearing 89 times (pages 400-488 inclusive is 89 pages: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, no, pages 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- Digit 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- Digit 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- Digit 4: 89 times (400-488)\n- Digits 0,5-9: 0 times in hundreds place beyond 400.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digits 1,2,3 each appear 100 times, but we're only interested in 4 and 8. So, digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, which seems correct because each digit appears 49 times in the units place. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times, so that's a difference of +2 for 4. In the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times and 8 appears 0 times, so that's a difference of +89 for 4. So total difference would be 2 + 89 = 91. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. Pages 400-488: that's 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4 for each, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages after 400, the tens digit goes up to 8 in pages 481-488, but only 8 times. So, digit 8 in the tens place is 40 (from first 400) + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but in the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, so 40 for 8 as well. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 8 appears 8 times, so total 48. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, each digit appears 49 times because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and 8 extra pages, each digit 0-8 appears once more, so 49 times each.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total is 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the units place, both 4 and 8 have the same count, but in the tens and hundreds places, 4 has more. So, the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it another way. Let me try to compute the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 pages, one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), page 484 has a 4 in units. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 pages, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Pages 440-449: that's 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: Pages 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: Similarly, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and in the remaining 8 pages, page 488 has an 8 in units. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each 100 pages contribute 10 times for each digit. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go up to 8, but only in pages 480-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? Pages 480-488: that's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Wait, let's check: 480 is page 480, which is included, and 488 is the last page. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 pages: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 (from first 400) + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When I broke down the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I considered the tens digits as:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, pages 481-488: 8 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times. Wait, but 480 is included in the previous set, 471-480, so 480 is page 480, which is in the 471-480 range, so tens digit 7. Then, pages 481-488: 8 pages, with tens digit 8. So, that's 8 times, not 9. So, in the remaining 88 pages, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place. So, total in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480 is in the 471-480 range, so 480 is included in that, making 481-488 only 8 pages. So, 8 times. So, total in tens place: 48 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and before that, it's 1,2,3. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 pages, so 8 times. But when I count from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, 8 times.\n\nSo, the total 8's in tens place is 48.\n\nWait, but when I first thought about the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 pages, so 89 times for 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the units place, both digits have the same count, but in the tens and hundreds places, 4 has more. So, the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 pages, digits 1-8 appear once each. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for digits 1-8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the first 400 pages. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, for digit 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. For digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488). Digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, the totals are as before.\n\nThus, the difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount the extra pages. Let me confirm the counts again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 488 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 // 10 = 48). Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so each of these digits appears once more. So, digits 1-8 appear 48 + 1 = 49 times each, and 0 appears 48 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the first 400 pages. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each digit from 0 to 7, they appear 10 times each in this range (e.g., 401-410: 0, 411-420:1, etc.), but for digit 8, it's only from 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, digit 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Digit 8 in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. No other digit appears in the hundreds place beyond 4.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so the difference is 91.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a number from 1 up to 488. Each digit in these numbers can be a 0-9, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nI think it would be helpful to count the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So for each 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of these 48 blocks, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. But wait, I also have to consider the last 8 numbers: 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in the units place, does 4 appear here? Let's see: 484 would have a 4 in the units place, right? So that's one more 4. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, in the last 8 numbers, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So total 8's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digit 8 appears once in the last block, so total 8's would be 48 (from the full blocks) plus 1, which is 49. Similarly, 4's would be 48 plus 1 (from 484), so 49 as well. So in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 each. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this range, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So that's one more 4 and one more 8. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each block of 100 numbers will have 10 occurrences of each digit from 0 to 9 in the tens place. So, for example, in 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So for each digit, like 4, it appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. Similarly for 8.\n\nSo, let's see how many full hundreds are in 488. There are 4 full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nBut wait, the last part is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So how does that affect the tens place? Let's see: from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So for each ten, like 400-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So in this last partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488), but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So the number of times 8 appears in the tens place here is 9.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, and so on up to 8 in 480-488. So for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 4's: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nSo in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. Let's see:\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, for 8's in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place. Let me double-check the tens place counts.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, there are 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 40 each. Then from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 times. No 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nUnits place: Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8. From 1-480, that's 48 times each, then from 481-488, units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total 49 each.\n\nSo adding up, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be different. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nStarting with the units digit:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times each digit 0-9 appears in units place: For each digit, it appears floor(488/10) times, which is 48 times, and then the remainder is 8. So for digits 0-7, they appear 48 times, and digits 8 and 9 appear 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but that doesn't seem right because 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so digits 0-8 appear 48 times plus 1 if their digit is less than or equal to the remainder. Wait, no, actually, for units digits, each digit from 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, and then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so each digit from 1-8 appears one more time. Therefore, digits 1-8 appear 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 9 appears 48 times. So for 4 and 8, units place count is 49 each.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/100) = 4 times, and then the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have tens digits from 0-8. So for each digit 0-8, they appear 4 times plus the number of times they appear in 401-488.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 9 times because 488 is the last number.\n\nWait, no. From 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 401-410 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 1: 411-420 \u2192 10\n- 2: 421-430 \u219210\n- 3: 431-440 \u219210\n- 4: 441-450 \u219210\n- 5: 451-460 \u219210\n- 6: 461-470 \u219210\n- 7: 471-480 \u219210\n- 8: 481-488 \u21928 numbers? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. Wait, 480 is the start, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them. So for tens digit 8, it's 9 times in 401-488.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me check:\n\n401-410: 10 numbers (tens digit 0)\n411-420:10 (tens 1)\n421-430:10 (tens 2)\n431-440:10 (tens 3)\n441-450:10 (tens 4)\n451-460:10 (tens 5)\n461-470:10 (tens 6)\n471-480:10 (tens 7)\n481-488:8 numbers (tens 8)\n\nWait, that adds up to 10*8 + 8 = 88, which is correct. So in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in all 8 of them, right? So that's 8 times. But earlier I thought it was 9 because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is part of the previous block (471-480), where tens digit is 7, right? Wait no, 480 is included in 480-488, which is part of the tens digit 8. Wait, 480 is the start, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So the tens digit is 8 in all 9 of these. But in the range 401-488, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 401-488 is 88 numbers, which would mean 8 full tens blocks (each 10 numbers) and then 8 extra, but that doesn't add up. Wait, 401-488 is 488 - 400 = 88 numbers, but 401-488 is 88 numbers, right? So from 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 401-410 \u219210\n- 1:411-420 \u219210\n- 2:421-430 \u219210\n- 3:431-440 \u219210\n- 4:441-450 \u219210\n- 5:451-460 \u219210\n- 6:461-470 \u219210\n- 7:471-480 \u219210\n- 8:481-488 \u21928 numbers.\n\nWait, that's 10*8 +8=88, which is correct. So in this case, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 401-488. But earlier I thought it was 9 because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but 480 is part of the previous block (tens digit 7), so 480 is included in 471-480, which is tens digit 7. Therefore, 480 is not part of the tens digit 8 block. So 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 401-488.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range, but its tens digit is 8? No, 480 is 480, so tens digit is 8, but it's the first number in the 480-488 range, which is part of the 481-488 block. Wait, no, 480 is part of the 480-488 block, which is the last block, but 480 is the starting point. So 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the context of 401-488, 480 is included, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me list the numbers:\n\n401: tens digit 0\n402: 0\n...\n410:0\n411:1\n...\n420:1\n421:2\n...\n430:2\n431:3\n...\n440:3\n441:4\n...\n450:4\n451:5\n...\n460:5\n461:6\n...\n470:6\n471:7\n...\n480:7\n481:8\n...\n488:8\n\nWait, no, that's not right. 480 is part of the 480-488 block, which has tens digit 8. So 480 is included in the tens digit 8 block. So from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. Therefore, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 401-488, so the tens digit 8 starts at 480, which is within 401-488. So from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, in 401-488, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 40 (from the full hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSimilarly, 4's in the tens place in 401-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So total 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSo that's consistent with my earlier calculation.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I can count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits from 1 to 9 appear once each in the units place. So, for example, pages 1-10 have 1,2,3,...,9,0 in the units place. Similarly, pages 11-20 have 1,2,...,9,0 again, and so on. Since we're dealing with a 488-page book, I can calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are and then handle any remaining pages.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the number of complete decades (sets of 10) times 1 (since 4 appears once every 10 pages). Similarly, the number of 8's would be the same. Let me compute that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra pages. In each complete decade, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times 1 is 48 for 4's and 48 for 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, for the extra 8 pages (pages 481-488), I need to check if any of these have a 4 or 8 in the units place. Page 484 has a 4 in the units place, and page 488 has an 8. So, in the units place, we have one additional 4 and one additional 8. Therefore, total 4's in units place would be 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal here. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake because 488 is the last page, so pages 481-488 are 8 pages, from 481 to 488 inclusive. So, let me count how many 4's and 8's in the units place in these 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, only 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, that's correct: one 4 and one 8 in the units place for the extra pages.\n\nSo, units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nSo, for a 488-page book, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, for each complete hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place from the complete hundreds.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I need to check the tens digits. Let's break this down:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-488). Wait, no, actually, 401-410 would have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 would have 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last few tens digits are 8.\n\nWait, actually, 401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420: tens digit 1\n421-430: tens digit 2\n431-440: tens digit 3\n441-450: tens digit 4\n451-460: tens digit 5\n461-470: tens digit 6\n471-480: tens digit 7\n481-490: tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- Tens digit 1: 10 pages (411-420)\n- Tens digit 2: 10 pages (421-430)\n- Tens digit 3: 10 pages (431-440)\n- Tens digit 4: 10 pages (441-450)\n- Tens digit 5: 10 pages (451-460)\n- Tens digit 6: 10 pages (461-470)\n- Tens digit 7: 10 pages (471-480)\n- Tens digit 8: 8 pages (481-488)\n\nWait, but actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the number of pages for each tens digit is as follows:\n\n- 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- 1: 10 pages (411-420)\n- 2: 10 pages (421-430)\n- 3: 10 pages (431-440)\n- 4: 10 pages (441-450)\n- 5: 10 pages (451-460)\n- 6: 10 pages (461-470)\n- 7: 10 pages (471-480)\n- 8: 8 pages (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there in 401-488?\n\nLooking for 4's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 4, which is from 441-450, that's 10 pages. So, 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nLooking for 8's in the tens place: when the tens digit is 8, which is from 481-488, that's 8 pages. So, 8 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for the incomplete hundred (401-488), we have 10 4's and 8 8's.\n\nAdding this to the complete hundreds: 40 4's + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 8's + 8 = 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the complete hundreds, we had 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's. Then, in the incomplete hundred, 401-488, we have 10 4's and 8 8's. So, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 8's.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, let me correct that. Actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages, starting from 0 for the first 99 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (no 4's or 8's)\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1 (no 4's or 8's)\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2 (no 4's or 8's)\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3 (no 4's or 8's)\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4 (so 4 appears here)\n\nSo, how many pages have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAs for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total in hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each step again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each complete set of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so 1 each.\n- Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each complete hundred (100 pages) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 488 pages mean 4 complete hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - Tens digits from 0 to 8.\n  - 4's in tens place: when tens digit is 4, which is 441-450, 10 pages.\n  - 8's in tens place: when tens digit is 8, which is 481-488, 8 pages.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nThat adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n- 8's: none, since the book doesn't reach 800 pages.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 pages, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 pages in 488, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each complete hundred (100 pages) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (441-450) and 8 8's (481-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99 have 0 in the hundreds place.\n   - Pages 100-399 have 1, 2, 3 in the hundreds place, contributing nothing.\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, adding 89 4's.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** There are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately because the digits can appear in either position. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference between the two totals.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, the digit in the units place cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 will appear exactly once in the units place, same with 8. But wait, does this hold true all the way up to 488? I think so, but I should check if there's any overlap or if 488 affects this.\n\nSo, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each complete set, the units digit 4 and 8 each appear once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra 4's in the last partial set. Wait, the last partial set is pages 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. In this range, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89). But since the book has 488 pages, I need to see how many full hundreds there are and if there's a partial hundred at the end.\n\n488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and an extra 88 pages. In each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 40 times in the tens place from the full hundreds. Now, for the last 88 pages, which are from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in the range 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is after 401, and 449 is before 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in the last partial hundred. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, adding up, tens place 4's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from last partial) = 50. Tens place 8's: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 (from last partial) = 49.\n\nNow, let me sum up the total number of 4's and 8's. For 4's: units place is 49, tens place is 50, so total 4's = 49 + 50 = 99. For 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98. Therefore, the number of 4's is 99, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 99 - 98 = 1. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the difference would be more. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 times. So, 40 from full hundreds plus 9 gives 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For units digit 4: in each set of ten, 1 occurrence, 48 sets give 48, and the last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, which is one more, so 49. Similarly, units digit 8: 48 sets give 48, plus 488, which is one more, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens digit 4: 4 full hundreds give 40, and the last partial hundred (401-488) includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. Tens digit 8: 4 full hundreds give 40, and the last partial hundred includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 = 99. Total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, the difference is 1. Hmm, but I thought maybe there was a mistake because I expected more. Maybe I should check if I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the hundreds place as well. Because in 488, the hundreds digit is 4, so does that affect the count? Let me think. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, I totally missed that in my initial calculation. That's a big oversight.\n\nSimilarly, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, the book is only 488 pages, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, not 8. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, I need to add 89 more 4's to my total.\n\nSo, let's recalculate. Total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. I think I forgot to consider the hundreds place initially, which is a significant factor because from 400 onwards, every page has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that adds 89 more 4's. So, the total number of 4's is much higher than I initially thought.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds).\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each ten-page block (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete ten-page blocks in 480 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred-page block (e.g., 1-100) contains ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 complete hundred-page blocks (400 pages), contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Pages 401-488 include an additional ten 4's (440-449) and nine 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0 (since the book doesn't reach 800 pages)\n\n**Total Occurrences:**\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds. That way, I can count how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nSo, the book has pages from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. So, for example, in pages 1-10, 4 appears on page 4 and 8 appears on page 8. This pattern repeats every 10 pages. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in each complete set of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Therefore, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each. Now, what about the remaining 8 pages? Those are pages 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in this partial set, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal, no difference there.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (pages 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (pages 80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages, which are from 401 to 488. The tens digit in this range cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on. Wait, actually, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, up to 8 for 481-490. But since our last page is 488, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, but only from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is included in the 400s, right? So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in pages 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, 4 appears 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from the remaining pages) = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nNow, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case since the book goes up to 488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. Let's count how many pages that is. From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits are only 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 pages: 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1=49 for both, correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred contributes 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Total 8's:49 +49 +0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10-page block contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks give 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100-page block contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 complete blocks give 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Summing Up:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit in page numbers starts from 1 for page 100 onwards, but for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in each digit place and similarly for 8, then subtract the two totals.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages. So in each complete set, 4 appears once in the units place, so 48 times, and 8 appears once, so 48 times. But then, we have the extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in the units place. So for units place, 4's count is 48, and 8's count is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, maybe I made a mistake there. Because when I have 488 pages, the units digit cycles up to 8 in the last partial set. So in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So the difference for units place is 49 - 48 = 1 more 8 than 4? Hmm, but I'm supposed to find how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I should track that later.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each block of 100 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each digit in the tens place, it appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, as does the tens digit 8. So for the first 400 pages, 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times as well.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but wait, we only go up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8 in 481-488. So, in the tens place for these 88 pages, how many times does 4 appear? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (from 480 to 488). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 is 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So overall, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 (from the first 400) + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the first 400 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times, and 8 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So total for tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49. So 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, because 800 is beyond 488. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49, so 4's are 1 less than 8's. So the difference is -1 (i.e., 1 fewer 4's than 8's).\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49, so 4's are 1 more than 8's. Difference is +1.\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0, so 4's are 89 more. Difference is +89.\n\nAdding these up: -1 + 1 + 89 = 89. So, 4's appear 89 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems a bit high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nWait, let me go through each digit place again more carefully.\n\nUnits place:\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once in units. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So total units: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, earlier I thought 8's were 49, but now I'm recalculating and getting 49 for both. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, because in the first 480 pages, each of the 48 sets of 10 gives 1 each, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So total units: 4's = 48 +1=49, 8's=48 +1=49. So units place: same number, difference 0.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's were 49, but that's correct because 480 pages give 48 each, and the last 8 pages add one each. So units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFirst 400 pages: 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So 4 appears 4*10=40 times, 8 appears 4*10=40 times.\n\nThen, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see, in each ten's group:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-490: tens digit 8\n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times? Wait, no, because 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but we only have up to 488, so 9 pages (480-488) have tens digit 8. Wait, but 480 is included in the 400-488 range, right?\n\nWait, no, 401-488 is 88 pages. So 401-488 is 88 pages, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each ten's group being 10 pages except the last one, which is 8 pages (481-488). So in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. How about 8? It's in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the last 88 pages.\n\nSo total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from first 400) + 10 = 50\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\nDifference: 50 - 49 = +1\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit 1, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit 2, same.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit 3, same.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit 4, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in hundreds place, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo hundreds place difference: 89 - 0 = +89\n\nNow, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49, difference 0\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49, difference +1\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0, difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nWait, so that's 90 more 4's than 8's. But earlier I thought it was 89. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears. So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, 4's in tens place: 10 times (440-449)\n8's in tens place: 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n8's: 40 + 9 = 49\nDifference: +1\n\nUnits place: 4's and 8's both 49, so 0 difference.\n\nSo total difference: 89 (hundreds) +1 (tens) +0 (units) = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 - 400 +1 is 89. Let me check: 400 is page 1, 401 is 2, ..., 488 is 89th page. So yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate units place.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach 10 pages, 4 appears once. So 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in units place: same calculation, 48 times in the full decades, and once in the last 8 pages (488), so 48+1=49.\n\nSo units place: both 49, difference 0.\n\nTens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8, difference +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 +1 +89=90.\n\nSo, 4's appear 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, let's check the tens place again.\n\nFrom 401-488, which is 88 pages.\n\nThe tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n411-420: 1 (10)\n421-430:2 (10)\n431-440:3 (10)\n441-450:4 (10)\n451-460:5 (10)\n461-470:6 (10)\n471-480:7 (10)\n481-490:8 (10)\n\nBut since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 pages. So in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\n8 appears in 481-490, but we only have 8 pages (481-488), so 8 appears 8 times, not 9. Wait, because 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so 8 times. So earlier I thought 9 times, but actually it's 8 times.\n\nSo in the tens place, from 401-488:\n\n4's:10\n8's:8\n\nSo total in tens place:\n\n4's:40 +10=50\n8's:40 +8=48\n\nSo difference in tens place:50 -48=+2\n\nWait, that changes things.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all 8 pages, so 8 times. So 8's in tens place from 401-488 is 8, not 9.\n\nSo total 8's in tens place:40 +8=48\n\nSo difference in tens place:50 -48=+2\n\nThen, units place:49 each, difference 0\n\nHundreds place:89 for 4's, 0 for 8's, difference +89\n\nTotal difference:0 +2 +89=91\n\nWait, now I'm getting 91. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Instead of breaking it down into hundreds, tens, units, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\nWe need to count how many times digit 4 appears in units, tens, and hundreds places from 1 to 488.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, every 10 pages, 4 appears once in units. So 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484). So total units place:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 times. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So total tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow, number of 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\nSame as 4's, every 10 pages, 8 appears once. 488/10=48.8, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So total units:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. 4 full hundreds:4*10=40 times. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for all 9 pages. So 9 times. So total tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, which is correct?\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. So total tens place:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times.\n\nSo total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, number of 4's:188\nNumber of 8's:98\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nSo, 4's appear 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was recalculating, I thought the tens place for 8's was 8 times, but now I'm getting 9 times. So I think the correct count is 9 times in the tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So yes, 9 times. So 40 (from first 400) +9=49.\n\nSo 8's total:49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\n4's total:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nSo the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but that was a miscalculation. So the correct difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - 488 pages contain 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Difference: 49 - 49 = 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 instances of each digit in the tens place.\n   - 400 pages contribute 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n   - Difference: 50 - 49 = +1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nThus, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That might make it easier to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, in 488 pages, how many sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, I think it's 48 full sets, and then 8 extra pages. Wait, no, actually, when counting from 1 to 488, the number of complete sets of 10 is 48, and then the remaining 8 pages are from 481 to 488. So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that would be 48 times 1 for 4's, which is 48, and 48 times 1 for 8's, which is also 48. But then we have the last 8 pages. Let's check those: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. In the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, units place has 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, in the units place, the count is equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds, and then 88 pages left. So, for each of the 4 hundreds, the tens digit has 10 fours and 10 eights. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 4 * 10 = 40 eights from the tens place. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 400 to 488. Let me check the tens place in this range. From 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, actually, 480 to 489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. Therefore, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and eights: 40 + 9 = 49. So, tens place gives us 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From page 1 to 399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3. From 400 to 488, it's 4. So, yes, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, hundreds place gives 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 fours, 49 eights\n- Tens place: 50 fours, 49 eights\n- Hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights\n\nAdding them together:\n\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 fours and 49 eights. Then in the tens place, 50 fours and 49 eights. Then hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit high. Let me check each step again.\n\nStarting with units place: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 full sets, 48 eights, plus in 481-488, 488 is the only one with an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 40-49 gives 10 fours, 80-89 gives 10 eights. So, 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 fours, 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n\nNow, the last partial hundred is 400-488. So, in the tens place, 400-409: tens digit is 0, 410-419: 1, ..., 440-449: 4, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours. Then 450-459:5, 460-469:6, 470-479:7, 480-488:8. So, 480-488 is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights. Therefore, in the tens place for 400-488, we have 10 fours and 9 eights.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. No eights in the hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought maybe the hundreds place would have more fours, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=8, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, so 48 +1 =49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449), so total fours in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nNumber of 8's: Similarly, floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488), so 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since 400-488 is within 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: Since 800>488, no eights in hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the hundreds place correctly. From page 1 to 399, hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's. From 400 to 488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages. So, 89 fours in hundreds place, correct.\n\nAnd no 8's in hundreds place because 800 is beyond 488.\n\nYes, so I think the calculation is correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488 (8 pages).\n   - **4's in units place:** 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (484) = 49.\n   - **8's in units place:** 48 (from complete sets) + 1 (488) = 49.\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contains 10 occurrences of '4' and '8' in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 for '4', 80-89 for '8').\n   - Complete hundreds in 488 pages: 4 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399).\n   - **4's in tens place from complete hundreds:** 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - **8's in tens place from complete hundreds:** 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Remaining pages: 400-488.\n     - **4's in tens place:** 440-449 (10 occurrences).\n     - **8's in tens place:** 480-488 (9 occurrences).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Count 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-399: Hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3; no '4's or '8's.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **8's in hundreds place:** 0 (since 800 exceeds 488).\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Each page has a number from 1 to 488, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times each digit appears in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears once and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and then 8 more pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once in this partial group as well. So, in total, the digit 4 appears 48 (from the complete groups) + 1 (from the partial group) = 49 times in the units place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a row for every hundred numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times every hundred numbers.\n\nNow, considering the entire range up to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial hundred from 401 to 488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), so that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89), so also 10 times per hundred.\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place, and the same for 8, so 40 times as well.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401 to 488. Let's consider the tens digit here. The numbers from 401 to 488 have tens digits from 0 to 8. Specifically, 401-410 have a tens digit of 0, 411-420 have 1, and so on up to 481-490, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-488, which is only 8 numbers (481,482,...,488). So, the tens digits in this partial hundred go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears only 8 times.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears exactly 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears once (from 441-450, which is 10 times, but wait, 441-450 is part of the partial hundred, right? Wait, no, 441-450 is within 401-488, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 441-450. So, that's 10 times. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so does that affect the tens digit? Hmm, no, because the tens digit is determined by the second digit from the right, and 488's tens digit is 8, but the numbers before that have tens digits up to 7.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place for the partial hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the partial hundred, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place overall, the digit 4 appears 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50 times, and the digit 8 appears 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 8 (from the partial hundred) = 48 times.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because in the complete hundreds, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 complete hundreds would give 4*10=40 times for each digit, including 4 and 8. Then, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. That's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 appears 40 times in the complete hundreds and 10 in the partial, making 50, and 8 appears 40 + 8 = 48. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right, and in this case, since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nEach hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has the same hundreds digit for all its numbers. So, for 1-100, the hundreds digit is 0 (since it's a three-digit number starting with 0, but in reality, it's just 1-100, so the hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99 and 1 for 100). Wait, actually, in page numbers, page 1 is '1', not '001', so perhaps I should consider that the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, that's a better way to think about it. So, pages 1-99 have no hundreds digit, or the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're considering three-digit numbers, maybe it's better to include leading zeros, but in reality, page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the hundreds digit is only present when the page number is 100 or above.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8, on the other hand, doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and before that, it's 3 for 300-399, 2 for 200-299, etc. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that seems correct because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 97 = 91, which seems like a big difference. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me double-check the counts. Maybe I overcounted in the hundreds place. Let me go back.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in pages 400-488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nNow, in the tens place, for the partial hundred (401-488), I thought 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). But wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's correct: 8 times.\n\nBut wait, in the complete hundreds (1-400), each complete hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 per hundred, so 4*10=40 times for 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, each complete hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40 times.\n\nBut in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8: 40 + 8 = 48. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each, as I calculated earlier.\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but that seems quite a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the units place, each digit 0-9 appears 49 times? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. So, for each digit, in the units place, it appears 48 times in the full tens, and then in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more, making it 49 each. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred, 8 also 10 times. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4, and 49+48+0=97 for 8. Difference is 91.\n\nWait, but 91 seems high, but maybe it's correct. Let me think differently. How many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? 89 numbers. Each contributes one 4. Then, in the tens place, 50 times, and units 49. So, 89+50+49=188.\n\nFor 8, only in units and tens: 49+48=97.\n\nSo, 188-97=91. So, yes, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When I count the hundreds digit, I'm counting 89 times for 4, but is that correct? Because pages 400-488 include 488 pages, so 488-400+1=89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nAnd for 8, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so 0 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 49 times in the units place (48 full tens and 1 extra in the last partial group).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred. For 488 pages:\n     - 4 appears 50 times (40 from complete hundreds, 10 from the partial).\n     - 8 appears 48 times (40 from complete hundreds, 8 from the partial).\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has a number that's either one, two, three, or maybe four digits long. But since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers will be from 1 to 488. So, the digits we're dealing with are units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. So, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and then add them up.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. I'll do this for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1 to 10, the 4 is in 4; from 11 to 20, it's in 14, and so on. So, in each set of 10, there's one 4 in the units place.\n\nHow many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (from 481 to 488). In each complete block, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), does the units digit have a 4? Let's see: 484 is in this range, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but hold on, 488 is the last page. So, the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 complete blocks plus 1 in the partial block, so 49 4's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 400-488. How many 4's are in the tens place here? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 0-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299, 240-249 is 10, and 300-399, 340-349 is 10. That's 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10. So, yes, 50 in total.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, the count is indeed 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-10, 8 is in 8; 11-20, it's in 18, and so on.\n\nTotal number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). Each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, the partial block is 481-488, which has 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100, specifically in the range x80-x89 for each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nFrom 0-99, it's 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199, 180-189 is 10; 200-299, 280-289 is 10; 300-399, 380-389 is 10; and 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, let's calculate.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds before 400: 4 (0-399). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 0-99, 10; 100-199, 10; 200-299, 10; 300-399, 10; and 400-488, 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 98. But let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 98 in total.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I calculated 4's, I got 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go back to the 8's in the tens place. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place for that range. So, 4*10=40 from the first four hundreds, plus 9, total 49.\n\nWait, but from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, units place: 49, as calculated.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed anything in the units place. From 481-488, the units digit 8 is only in 488, so that's correct. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, and then one more in the partial block, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's, I had 49 in units, 50 in tens, and 89 in hundreds, totaling 188.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440 to 449 is 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. So, that's 10, plus the four hundreds before that, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10, total 50. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nFor the 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me verify each part again.\n\nStarting with 4's in units place: Each block of 10 has one 4. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the partial block from 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so 1 more. Total 49. Correct.\n\n4's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 4*10=40. Then, 400-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50. Correct.\n\n4's in hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's in units place: Each block of 10 has one 8. 48 full blocks, so 48. Partial block 481-488: 488 has an 8, so 1 more. Total 49. Correct.\n\n8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (0-399) contribute 4*10=40. Then, 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49. Correct.\n\n8's in hundreds place: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, each printed once. So, each page number is either a single-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the digits 0 through 9 appear once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each complete group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, we have 8 extra pages beyond 480, which are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once more in 484, and the digit 8 appears once more in 488. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's is 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so in the units place, they're equal.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages into the fifth hundred. In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401 to 488. Wait, actually, after 400, the next hundreds would be 400-499, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit in this partial hundred would be from 0 to 8. Let me think. Wait, no, the tens digit in 400-488 would be 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440 to 449, that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the total 4's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-400, the tens digit for 4's would be in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10, so 40+10=50 for 4's. For 8's, from 1-400, each hundred has 80-89, so 10 times per hundred, 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40+9=49 for 8's in the tens place. So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are one more.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how often 4 and 8 appear here. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. As for 8, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. When I was counting the tens digit for 400-488, I considered 440-449 as 10 times, which is correct, and 480-488 as 9 times, which is also correct. So, 10 + 9 = 19 in the partial hundred, but wait, no, that's not how it adds up. Wait, in the hundreds place, we have 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for each ten, like 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. So, in each of these, the tens digit is 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's once every 100, so from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. So, that part seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: for the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4.\n\nFor the units place, from 1-488, how many 4's? Every 10 pages, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the extra 8 pages (481-488), which includes 484, so one more 4, making it 49. Similarly for 8's, 48 in the full groups, plus 488, so 49. That seems right.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. So, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because 488 is the last page. Let me check the tens place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. Similarly, 8 in the tens place is in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, yes, I think my calculation is correct. The number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each group contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count the number of times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the two counts to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by understanding how page numbers are formed. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are:\n\n1 to 9: one-digit\n10 to 99: two-digit\n100 to 488: three-digit\n\nI think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each of these ranges separately.\n\nStarting with the one-digit numbers: pages 1 to 9. Here, the digits are just 1 through 9. So, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. So far, the count is 4:1, 8:1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, two-digit numbers: pages 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers, the digits go from 1 to 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place (since there are 9 decades: 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, for the digit 4, it appears in the units place 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Similarly, for 8, it appears 9 times (18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98).\n\nWait, but in the tens place for two-digit numbers, we already counted 44 and 88. So, in the units place, do we count them again? I think yes, because each digit's occurrence is counted separately in each place. So, even though 44 has both tens and units as 4, it's counted once in the tens and once in the units. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, for 8's, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nBut wait, let me check: from 10 to 99, how many 4's are there? For tens place: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in tens place. For units place: every ten has one 4, so 9 times. So total 19. Same for 8's: tens place 10 times, units place 9 times, total 19. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, the difference so far is still 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: pages 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n1. Hundreds digit is 1: pages 100-199. In this case, the hundreds digit is 1, so it doesn't contribute to 4's or 8's. We need to look at the tens and units places for both digits.\n\n2. Hundreds digit is 2: pages 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no contribution to 4's or 8's. Again, check tens and units.\n\n3. Hundreds digit is 3: pages 300-399. Same here, hundreds digit is 3. No contribution.\n\n4. Hundreds digit is 4: pages 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so this will contribute to the count of 4's.\n\nI think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position (hundreds, tens, units) for each hundred group.\n\nStarting with hundreds digit:\n\n- For 4's: Only in pages 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- For 8's: The hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nLet's consider each hundred group:\n\n1. 100-199: Tens digit can be 0-9, so for each ten, there are 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's in 140-149, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 180-189, which is 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same logic. Tens digit 4 is in 240-249: 10 times. Tens digit 8 is in 280-289: 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Tens digit 4 is in 340-349: 10 times. Tens digit 8 is in 380-389: 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488: Now, this is a bit different because the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For tens digit 8: 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers are there? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers. So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, summing up the tens place:\n\n- For 4's: in 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 10+10+10+10 = 40.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is only 9 times, as we saw. So, for 8's in tens place: 10 (from 100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Let me check again.\n\nWait, for each hundred group except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. But in the last group (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), but the tens digit 8 only appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) = 40.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in the last group, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nNow, moving to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nAgain, considering each hundred group:\n\n1. 100-199: For units digit 4, it appears once every ten numbers, so 10 times (104,114,...,194). Similarly, units digit 8 appears 10 times (108,118,...,198).\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above, units digit 4 appears 10 times, units digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399: Units digit 4 appears 10 times, units digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488: Now, units digit 4 appears how many times? Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, how many complete tens are there?\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 89 divided by 10 is 8 complete tens (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 another 10, etc. Let me count how many full tens are there.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, the number of times units digit is 4 would be how many? Let's see, 400-409: 404 is one, 410-419:414, etc. Since 488 is the last, the last ten is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears once in each ten except possibly the last one.\n\nWait, 400-409: 404\n410-419:414\n420-429:424\n430-439:434\n440-449:444\n450-459:454\n460-469:464\n470-479:474\n480-488:484\n\nWait, 480-488 includes 484, which is a units digit 4. So, that's 9 times in total for units digit 4 in 400-488.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 in 400-488:\n\n400-409:408\n410-419:418\n420-429:428\n430-439:438\n440-449:448\n450-459:458\n460-469:468\n470-479:478\n480-488:488\n\nSo, that's 9 times as well.\n\nWait, but in each hundred group except the last one, units digits 4 and 8 appear 10 times each. But in the last group (400-488), units digits 4 and 8 appear 9 times each because the last ten is incomplete (only 9 numbers). So, let me calculate:\n\nFor units digit 4:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal: 10+10+10+9=39\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\nTotal:10+10+10+9=39\n\nWait, but wait, in the units place, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for units place:\n\n4's: 39\n8's:39\n\nWait, but in the tens place, we had 4's:40 and 8's:39. So, combining tens and units in three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4's: tens=40, units=39, so total 79\nFor 8's: tens=39, units=39, so total 78\n\nBut wait, we also have the hundreds place contributing to 4's. In the hundreds place, as we saw earlier, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). So, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39, total=89+40+39=168.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit numbers: hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39, total=0+39+39=78.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times, and 8's appear 78 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- One-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- One-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nWait, so 4's total 188, 8's total 98. So, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me verify the counts step by step.\n\nFirst, one-digit numbers:\n\n4 appears once (page 4)\n8 appears once (page 8)\nSo, 4:1, 8:1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\nTens place:\n4 appears 10 times (40-49)\n8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n\nUnits place:\n4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94)\n8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98)\n\nTotal two-digit:\n4:10+9=19\n8:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:\n4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n8 appears 0 times\n\nTens place:\n4 appears 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-449) =40\nWait, but earlier I thought in 400-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (480-488)=39\n\nUnits place:\n\n4's:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488)=39\n8's:10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, three-digit:\n\n4's: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39, total=89+40+39=168\n8's: hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39, total=78\n\nAdding up all:\n\n4's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)=1+19=20+168=188\n8's:1 +19 +78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't double-count any digits. For example, in 44, both the tens and units digits are 4, so each occurrence is counted separately. Similarly, in 88, both digits are 8. So, that's correct because each digit is counted in their respective places.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits printed.\n\nWait, maybe that's overkill, but just to be sure.\n\nTotal pages:488\n\nNumber of digits:\n\n- Pages 1-9:9 pages, 1 digit each:9 digits\n- Pages 10-99:90 pages, 2 digits each:180 digits\n- Pages 100-488:389 pages, 3 digits each:1167 digits\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits\n\nNow, total 4's:188\nTotal 8's:98\nDifference:90\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - **Total for Two-Digits:**\n     - 4: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n     - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-449), totaling 40.\n     - 8 appears 10 times in the first three hundred groups and 9 times in 400-488 (480-488), totaling 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times in each hundred group except 400-488, where it appears 9 times, totaling 39.\n     - 8 appears similarly 39 times.\n   - **Total for Three-Digits:**\n     - 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the digits can be in the units place, tens place, or hundreds place. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten pages. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every ten pages. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages. Wait, but in the remaining 8 pages, which would be from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they are equal. \n\nWait, but maybe I should check that again. Let me think: each complete set of ten has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets give 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, and 488 has an 8. So, that's one more 4 and one more 8. So, units place total: 49 each. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times every hundred pages. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0.\nFrom 410-419: tens digit is 1.\nFrom 420-429: tens digit is 2.\nFrom 430-439: tens digit is 3.\nFrom 440-449: tens digit is 4. That's 10 pages, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\nFrom 450-459: tens digit is 5.\nFrom 460-469: tens digit is 6.\nFrom 470-479: tens digit is 7.\nFrom 480-488: tens digit is 8. That's 9 pages (480-488), so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place: 4's are 40 (from the hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. So, 4's are one more than 8's here.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, so pages 1-99 have 0 in the hundreds place. \n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nSo, total in the hundreds place: 4's are 89, 8's are 0. So, 4's are 89 more than 8's here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each place.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0.\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference: +1.\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89.\n\nSo, total difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then, in 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for 4, 48 +1=49 for 8. Correct.\n\nTens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 440-449 block, 4 appears 10 times. In 480-488, 8 appears 9 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 10 and 9 respectively. So, 40+10=50 for 4's, 40+9=49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48*1=48 for each, plus 1 each in 484 and 488. So, 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99+89=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 complete sets of 10 (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - In 48 sets, 4 and 8 each appear 48 times.\n   - In the extra 8 pages, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - 488 pages include 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) and 88 extra pages (401-488).\n   - In 4 hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 40 times in the tens place.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - 440-449: 4 appears 10 times.\n     - 480-488: 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: +89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +1\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Total: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits in the units place and the tens place separately. So, each page number can be thought of as having a tens digit and a units digit, except for the single-digit pages, which only have a units digit. But since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Wait, 488 is a 3-digit number, so the page numbers go up to 488. \n\nI think I should calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. That makes sense. So, let me start by calculating how many 4's are there in the units place and then in the tens place, and maybe even in the hundreds place, although since 488 is the highest page number, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each position.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades (each of 10 numbers) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, because 450-459 would be beyond 488? Wait, no, 440-449 is within 488, but 450-459 would be up to 459, which is still within 488. Hmm, no, wait, 450 is 450, and 488 is higher than that, so 450-459 is also a valid block. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, 450-459 is another 10, and then 460-469, 470-479, 480-488. Wait, but I'm only concerned with the tens digit being 4. So, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. So, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks. Each contributes 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 count? 440 is within 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is the sum of 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = let's add them up.\n\n49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is indeed 99, and 99 + 89: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units, tens, and hundreds places in the page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 complete blocks. Each contributes one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems similar to the 4's. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, so each of these blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place except possibly the last one, which is 480-488. Let me check.\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\n180-189: another 10.\n\n280-289: another 10.\n\n380-389: another 10.\n\n480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one block of 9 (480-488). So, 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's in the tens place, so total 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, the hundreds place contributes zero 8's.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, so 98 in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. 480-488: 9 numbers. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through each step again.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades (each contributing 1), plus 1 in the last 8 numbers, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete decades, plus 1 in the last 8 numbers, so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, and 480-488 contributing 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for the 8's, since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to check: maybe using a formula or another method to count the digits.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the last digit is >= d else 0).\n\nWait, but in our case, for 4's, n=488. So, floor(488/10)=48, and since the last digit is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49. Similarly for 8's, floor(488/10)=48, and since last digit is 8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. For digit d in the tens place, the count is:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so in each hundred, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- The number of complete hundreds is floor(n/100).\n\n- Then, for the remaining part, if the tens digit is >= d, add 10, else add 0. But if the remaining part is less than 10, adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to break it down as:\n\nFor the tens digit, the count is:\n\nnumber_of_complete_hundreds = floor(n / 100)\n\ncount = number_of_complete_hundreds * 10\n\nremaining = n % 100\n\nif remaining >= 10 * d, then count += 10\nelse if remaining >= d * 10, count += (remaining - (d * 10) + 1)\nelse, count += 0\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try with n=488.\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488 / 100) = 4.\n\nEach complete hundred contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, the remaining part is 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nNow, the tens digit in 88 is 8, which is greater than 4, so we add another 10 (from 440-449), but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's another 10. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(488 / 100) = 4.\n\nEach contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nRemaining part: 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nNow, the tens digit in 88 is 8, which is equal to 8, so we add another 10 (from 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so maybe this formula isn't perfect here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula needs adjustment for when the remaining part is less than 100.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nFor the tens digit, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\ncount = (number_of_complete_hundreds) * 10\n\nremaining = n % 100\n\nif remaining >= 10 * d:\n    count += 10\nelif remaining >= d * 10:\n    count += (remaining - d * 10 + 1)\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, but let's test this with d=8 and n=488.\n\nnumber_of_complete_hundreds = 4\n\ncount = 4 * 10 = 40\n\nremaining = 88\n\nNow, 10 * d = 80.\n\nSince 88 >= 80, we add 10, so count becomes 50. But wait, in reality, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 10. So, the formula is overcounting here.\n\nHmm, perhaps the formula isn't accurate when the remaining part is less than 100 but the tens digit is d. So, maybe I need to adjust it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of blocks. For each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each, so each digit d appears 10 times in the tens place per block. So, for 4 blocks (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for digit 8 in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0-8. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 more 8's in the tens place, making it 40 + 9 = 49, which matches our earlier count.\n\nSo, perhaps using the formula, we have to adjust for the last partial block.\n\nSo, in any case, I think our initial count was correct: 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making the total 40 + 10 = 50, which is correct.\n\nSo, I think our counts for 4's and 8's are accurate.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, since the book doesn't go beyond 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, 188 4's and 98 8's, so 90 more 4's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n### Counting the digit 4:\n1. **Units place**:\n   - For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once.\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place**:\n   - The digit 4 appears in blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place**:\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488.\n   - This is 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(89\\).\n\nTotal occurrences of 4: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the digit 8:\n1. **Units place**:\n   - For every 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once.\n   - Total: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place**:\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 occurrences, and the last block contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place**:\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place for any page number up to 488.\n   - Total: \\(0\\).\n\nTotal occurrences of 8: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\n- The number of 4's exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at the digits separately, like units place and tens place, and count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place. That makes sense because each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. So, let's start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, right? Similarly, the digit 8 also appears once in the units place every 10 pages. So, if I can figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages, I can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. The last set will be incomplete. So, maybe I should calculate the number of complete sets and then add the remaining pages. Let me see. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, for the remaining 8 pages, which are pages 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each? Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for example, from page 1 to 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each set of 100 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 40-49), and the same for 8 (from 80-89). So, how many complete sets of 100 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete sets of 100 pages each. Each set contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from page 401 to 488. Wait, no, actually, the complete sets are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let me see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in this range, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 pages. But wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 occurrences. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 pages because 488 is the last page. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete set.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the incomplete set was 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear? Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 pages except for the last one, which is only 8 pages (481-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. Therefore, in the incomplete set, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding that to the complete sets: 40 (from the 4 sets of 100) plus 10 gives 50 for 4's in the tens place, and 40 plus 9 gives 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in each complete set of 100, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place, so 4 sets would give 40 each. Then, in the incomplete set, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but actually, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page with an 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so 188 4's minus 98 8's equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages = 488\n\nNumber of complete sets of 10: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 sets with remainder 8.\n\nEach set contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in units place, so 48 each.\n\nRemaining 8 pages: 481-488.\n\nUnits digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nSo, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nTotal units: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete sets of 100: 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 sets with remainder 88.\n\nEach set contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nRemaining 88 pages: 401-488.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\n8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, maybe I should check another approach or see if I missed any pages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\nUnits place: as before, 49.\n\nTens place: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, same result. So, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Complete sets of 10: 48 sets, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n   - Remainder (481-488): 4 and 8 each appear once.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Complete sets of 100: 4 sets, each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 and 8.\n   - Remainder (401-488): 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means the number of 4's in the units place would be equal to the number of 8's in the units place, right? So, maybe the difference between the number of 4's and 8's comes from the tens and hundreds places. \n\nWait, but I need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place. Let's go through each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, if there are 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, there are 48 complete blocks, and then 8 extra pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. That's 4*10 = 40 times each. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). Wait, actually, the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0.\n411-420: tens digit is 1.\n...\n481-490: tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488, so it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is part of 401-488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 times. \n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. Wait, no, 480 is 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last 88 pages.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4 appears 4*10 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nUnits place: 49 times each.\nTens place: 50 times for 4, 49 times for 8.\nHundreds place: 89 times for 4, 0 times for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems high. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 10 + 40 = 50 for 4, and 9 + 40 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but that seems a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I overcounted the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so that's 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe I should count how many times 4 appears in each digit place and how many times 8 appears, then subtract.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total units place 4's: floor(488/10)=48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), 4 appears once (484). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So, 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place: Same as 4's, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), 8 appears once (488). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds, 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 8 never appears in the hundreds place, as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big number, but maybe that's correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if 484 is within the range. Since 484 is less than 488, yes, so 49.\n\nSame for 8: 488 is included, so 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8.\n\nSo, 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40 for 4's, 4*10=40 for 8's.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 for 480-488 (9 numbers). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488 have hundreds digit 4, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n8's total:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I can think of each page number as a three-digit number, possibly with leading zeros, like 001, 002, ..., up to 488. But maybe leading zeros don't actually affect the count, so perhaps I should just consider the actual digits used without padding.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to consider each digit place individually. So, for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 repeats every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any extra in the incomplete group. The incomplete group is 481 to 488, so looking at the units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, units place total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so maybe I should check again. Wait, no, 488 is included, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in that last group, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 4's = 48 * 1 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 * 1 + 1 = 49. So, same count for units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 repeats every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, we have the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. So, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLet's break it down. From 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except maybe the last one if it's incomplete.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-490:8, but wait, 488 is the end, so 481-488 is only 8 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, for 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 times)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 times)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 times)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 times)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 times)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 times)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 times)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 times)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 times)\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears 10 times in 441-450, and that's the only occurrence in the 401-488 range. So, 10 times.\n\nHow about 8? It appears 8 times in 481-488. So, in the tens place, 4's count is 10, and 8's count is 8.\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n\n4's: 4 (from hundreds) * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 401-488, so total 50.\n\n8's: 4 (from hundreds) *10 = 40, plus 8 in 401-488, so total 48.\n\nWait, that seems right. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, each page number from 1-99 has a hundreds digit of 0, but since we're only considering actual digits printed, maybe we don't count leading zeros. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 times. How about 8? Since 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place counts: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48*1=48 for each. Then, the last partial group from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units 4's: 48+1=49, units 8's: 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits: 0-8. In 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, total tens 4's: 40 +10=50, tens 8's:40 +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, hundreds 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 groups.\n   - 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place.\n   - The last partial group (481-488) adds 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - **Total 4's from complete hundreds:** 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n   - **Total 8's from complete hundreds:** 4 \u00d7 10 = 40\n   - From 401-488:\n     - Tens digit 4 appears in 441-450 (10 times).\n     - Tens digit 8 appears in 481-488 (8 times).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place: 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"
