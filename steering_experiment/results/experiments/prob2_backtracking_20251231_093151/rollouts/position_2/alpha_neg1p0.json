    "text": " \n\nAlright, page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. Maybe I can calculate how many times each digit (4 and 8) appears in each place and then sum them up. That sounds like a plan.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a range of numbers. Since we're going up to 488, I need to see how many complete sets of 10 there are and then check the remainder.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each complete set of 10 (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's would also be 48.\n\nBut wait, we have that extra 8 numbers: 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in this extra part? Yes, at 484. So, that's one more 4. And 8 appears at 488, so that's one more 8.\n\nSo, for the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. Let's see how many hundreds we have here.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, so the hundreds part is 4, but let me think about the tens place.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10, same for 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that would be 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nBut wait, we have 488 pages, so after 400, we have 88 more pages. Let me check the tens digits from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digits in this last partial hundred would be 0,1,2,...,8.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, how about 8? From 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 numbers, except for the last one which is cut off at 88. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we're stopping at 488, does that affect it?\n\nWait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast this.\n\nIn the 401-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times because each is followed by 10 units digits (0-9). But for the tens digit 8, it's only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 times.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, 480 is the first number with tens digit 8, and then 481-488, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this range.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- For 4: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred (440-449). So total 50.\n\n- For 8: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred (480-488). So total 49.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me make sure. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, right? So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4: it occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n\nFor the tens digit 8: it occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, adding to the 4 hundreds, we have 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent. Let me check again. From 1-400, each tens digit 0-9 appears 40 times (4 hundreds * 10). Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 8 times? Wait, no, because 481-488 is 8 numbers, but 480 is also included, right? Wait, 480 is part of 401-488, so 480 is the first number with tens digit 8, followed by 481-488, which is 9 numbers in total. So, tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n\n- 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, 400 is included, so from 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n\n- 8's: 0 times, because the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 50\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 49\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each set of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n\n- 488 / 10 = 48 full sets, remainder 8.\n\n- So, 48 * 1 = 48 for each digit, plus in the remainder (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units: 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\n- 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\n- Then, in 401-488, tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\n- For 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, total 50.\n\n- For 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, total 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - In the remaining pages (481-488), '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49 for both '4' and '8'.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place for the first 400 pages.\n   - From 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449) and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50 for '4'; 40 + 9 = 49 for '8'.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for '4'; 0 for '8'.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488).\n\nI think I should calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once. For example, from 1-10: 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20: 4 appears once (page 14), and so on. \n\n   Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each complete set, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. Does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, for the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in a block of 100. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. \n\n   Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 (since 400 is the fourth hundred). Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, we have the remaining 88 pages after 400 (401-488). Wait, actually, after 400, the next set is 400-499, but since we only go up to 488, we need to check how many tens places have 4 in this range. From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only once in this range, from 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, does that affect it? No, because 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 = 50.\n\n   Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. From 1-400, how many 4's in the tens place? Each hundred has 10, so 4 hundreds would have 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499, but since we stop at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's. In every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, each digit appears 10 times in a block of 100. So, for 8's, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, e.g., 80-89. \n\n   Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. Wait, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all, so that's 9 times. But wait, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\n   Wait, let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more. So, 40+9=49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0, so total 98.\n\nBut wait, earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 4's. Then 481-488: 484 is the only one, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 8's. Then 481-488: 488 is the only one, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in tens place, so 4*10=40. Then 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 more. Total 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's. So, 40+9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, though since the book only has 488 pages, the thousands place would only be relevant if we had a page number 1000 or above, which we don't. So, I can probably ignore the thousands place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in every block of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means that for the digit 4, it appears once every 10 pages, and similarly for the digit 8. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about how many times each digit appears in the units place up to page 488. Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 pages and then an extra 8 pages. In each full group, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 times each. Now, the extra 8 pages go from 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these extra pages, the digit 8 appears once in the units place (page 488), and the digit 4 doesn't appear here because the units digits go up to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so 8 appears once more in the units place than 4. But I should check if this is correct.\n\nWait, let me confirm: from page 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10. So, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, in total, units place: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Oh, wait, so actually, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 4 doesn't appear in the extra pages. No, 4 does appear once in the units place at page 484, and 8 appears once at 488. So, both have 49 occurrences in the units place. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit changes every 10 pages, so for each group of 100 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, it's the same, and so on. But since our book ends at 488, which is less than 500, I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFirst, let's consider the tens place from page 1 to page 488. The tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, but since we're only going up to 488, the highest tens digit is 8 (from 480-488). \n\nWait, actually, let me think in terms of hundreds. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488.\n\nNow, focusing on the tens place. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). \n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, the last hundred (400-488) doesn't complete the full 100 pages. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in each hundred:\n\n1. Pages 1-99: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n2. Pages 100-199: Similarly, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n3. Pages 200-299: 4 appears 10 times (240-249), 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n4. Pages 300-399: 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n5. Pages 400-488: Now, here, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit cycles 0-8, but only up to page 488. \n\nWait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which is 8, because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is only 9 times? Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, from 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times because 480-488 is 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive), but wait, no, that's only 9 pages. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 only appears 9 times in the tens place (480-488). Hmm, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for each of those pages, so the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for the 400-488 range. Similarly, the digit 4 in the tens place would be from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 pages.\n\n410-419: tens digit 1, 10 pages.\n\n...\n\n440-449: tens digit 4, 10 pages.\n\n...\n\n480-488: tens digit 8, 9 pages.\n\nSo, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each in the tens place. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nThen, in the 400-488 range, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n4: 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\n8: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 appears once more in the tens place than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? Does 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? No, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 appears 89 more times than 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences in each digit place:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 50 times\n- 8: 49 times\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89 times\n- 8: 0 times\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me add that again:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 4 appears 188 times, 8 appears 98 times.\n\nThe question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nLet me verify each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\nAs I thought earlier, every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Similarly for 8, 48 times in the full tens, and once in the remaining pages (488), so 49 times. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- For each hundred (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each: 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, tens place total:\n4: 40 + 10 = 50\n8: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n4: 89\n8: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4 was 89, which seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages.\n\nWait, let me confirm 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place. For the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem by calculating the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother way to think about it is:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- Total pages: 488\n- Each digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10) = 48 times, plus an extra for the remaining pages if the digit is <= remaining pages mod 10.\n\nWait, perhaps using a formula for digit occurrences.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is:\n\nnumber = (n // 10) * 1 + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nnumber = (n // 100) * 10 + (min(max(n % 100 - 10 * d + 1, 0), 10))\n\nBut maybe it's easier to break it down manually.\n\nWait, maybe I should try using the formula to cross-verify.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: (488 // 10) * 1 + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0) = 48 * 1 + 1 (since 8 >=4) = 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: same calculation: 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: (488 // 100) * 10 + (min(max(488 % 100 - 10*4 +1,0),10)).\n\nWait, 488 // 100 = 4, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, 488 % 100 = 88.\n\nSo, 88 - 10*4 +1 = 88 -40 +1=49.\n\nBut since 49 >10, we take min(49,10)=10.\n\nSo, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\n\n(488 // 100)*10=40.\n\n488%100=88.\n\n88 -10*8 +1=88-80+1=9.\n\nSince 9 >=0, min(9,10)=9.\n\nSo, total 40+9=49.\n\nSo, that matches our earlier calculation.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: (488 // 1000)*100 + (1 if 488 >= 400 else 0). Wait, maybe better to think as:\n\nEach hundred block contributes 100 numbers, so for digit 4 in hundreds place, it's from 400-499, but since our book ends at 488, it's 488 -400 +1=89 times.\n\nSo, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, digit 8 in hundreds place: since 800 >488, it doesn't appear, so 0 times.\n\nSo, yes, hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me add 49+50+89 again.\n\n49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nAnd 49+49=98.\n\n188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full tens: 48 (from 1-480), each contributing 1 occurrence of '4' and '8'.\n   - Remaining pages (481-488) add 1 more occurrence of '4' (at 484) and 1 more of '8' (at 488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred block (e.g., 1-99, 100-199) has '4' and '8' each appearing 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-399) contribute 40 each.\n   - In 400-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), while '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: '4' = 50, '8' = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: '4' = 89, '8' = 0.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks and then the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488). In each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no 4 in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, every number has a 4 in the tens place. So, each such block contributes 10 4's. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in the first 100 numbers (1-100), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 numbers. This pattern continues up to 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is a bit different because it doesn't complete the full 100. So, let's calculate how many full hundreds we have. From 1-400, that's four sets of 100. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's an additional 10. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-100: 40-49, that's 10. 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. So that's 40. Then, 401-488: 440-449, another 10. So, yes, 50 in total for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, up to 488, how many blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 8's. Let's count how many such blocks are in 1-488. From 1-400, we have four blocks: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10, so that's 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but in the tens place, each number from 480-488 has an 8 in the tens place, right? So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, we have four blocks, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier, for 4's, we had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me double-check my counts because that seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. Let me go through it again.\n\nIn the tens place, each time the tens digit is 8, it's a block of 10 numbers. So, from 80-89: 10 numbers, 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, we have 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial block from 481-488 has 8 in the units place at 488, so that's 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 in the units place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the 4's count. Let me go through the 4's again.\n\nUnits place: Each block of 10 has one 4. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, the last 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so total units 4's: 48.\n\nTens place: Each time the tens digit is 4, it's a block of 10. From 1-400, that's 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349: four blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, total tens 4's: 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 4's.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, from 401-488, 480-488: 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place, so +9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book only goes up to 488, which is less than 800. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So from page 1 to page 488, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nFirst, for the units place:\n\n- For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place will be each number from 0 to 9 exactly once. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So in each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: in each block of 10, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last 8 pages, 8 appears in 488, so that's one more. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems equal. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check. For the units place, each block of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So up to 480, that's 48 blocks, so 48 4's and 48 8's. Then from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total 49 4's and 49 8's in the units place. So far, the counts are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 for 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nSo, how many full hundreds are in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see when the tens digit is 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 401-488 includes 440-449 as part of it. So that's 10 times for 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 in the tens place appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 times. Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480 is the first, then 481 up to 488, which is 9 more, so total 10 numbers? Wait, no, 480 is one, then 481-488 is 8 more, so total 9 numbers. So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is present in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, right? Because 480 is in the 480-489 range, but 480 is included as the start. Wait, 480 is part of the 480-489 block, but in our case, the pages go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range, so when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred (440-449), so total 50.\n\nWait, no, wait. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's 10 occurrences. So total 4's in tens place: 4*10 +10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from the full hundreds) +9 (from the last partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the last partial hundred's 8's in tens place was 9, but let me confirm. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So that's 9 times. So total 8's in tens place: 4*10 +9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's occur 50 times and 8's occur 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digits go from 1 to 4, since the book has 488 pages. So the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49+49=98, yes. So total 8's are 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because that seems like a big difference. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- Number of full blocks: 48 (since 488 /10 = 48.8)\n- So 48 4's and 48 8's.\n- Then the last 8 pages: 481-488. The units digits here are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units place: 48+1=49 for 4's and 48+1=49 for 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- Number of full hundreds: 4 (since 488/100=4.88)\n- So 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n- Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488.\n- In this range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n- So total tens place: 40+10=50 4's and 40+9=49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the last partial hundred. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So that's correct. And the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 pages. So 9 times. So 40+10=50 for 4's and 40+9=49 for 8's.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the total counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's in the units place.\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 consecutive numbers (e.g., 1-100) contains 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds in 488 pages, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) include 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, contributing 89 4's.\n   - The hundreds digit never reaches 8 in this range.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Summing Up All Occurrences:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since 488 is a three-digit number, the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the same for 8. So for units place, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). Wait, no, actually, it's 48 full blocks because 48*10=480, and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So in each of the 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times each for units place.\n\nBut wait, I also need to check the last partial block from 481 to 488. In the units place here, the digits go from 1 to 8. So does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4 in the units place. 8 appears at 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place.\n\nSo total units place: 48 (from full blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49 for 4, and 48 +1=49 for 8. Wait, but actually, in the units place of the last block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 is at 484, and 8 is at 488. So yes, both get one more each. So units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow moving to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit appears 10 times in a block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49), and similarly for 8 (80-89). So in each block of 100, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the total number of pages is 488, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So for each hundred, 10 times each digit in tens place. So 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times for 4 and 4*10=40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488. Let's look at the tens place here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. Wait, no, 480-488 would be tens digit 8, but 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; 461-470, it's 6; 471-480, it's 7; and 481-488, it's 8. Wait, but 480 is included in 471-480, so the tens digit for 480 is 8? No, wait, 480 is part of 480-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488.\n\nWait, but actually, 480 is in the 480-488 range, so the tens digit is 8 for all those pages. So in the tens place from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, 441-450 would have a tens digit of 4, which is 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 would have a tens digit of 8, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 488-480+1=9 pages. So the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each block of 100 has 10 occurrences, but here, the last partial block might not have a full 10. So in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo adding to the previous 40 times from the full hundreds, the total for tens place is 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 for 441-450, making 50 for 4's, and 40 plus 9 for 480-488, making 49 for 8's.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So total tens place: 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 401-488, the tens digits go through 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except maybe the last one. Wait, 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 pages. 411-420: 1, 10 pages. 421-430:2, 10 pages. 431-440:3, 10 pages. 441-450:4, 10 pages. 451-460:5, 10 pages. 461-470:6, 10 pages. 471-480:7, 10 pages. 481-488:8, 8 pages (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 481-488 is 8 pages: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488, which is 8 numbers. So the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. So that would mean in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. So I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nSo let's correct that. From 401-488, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 401-410: 10 pages\n- 1: 411-420: 10 pages\n- 2: 421-430: 10 pages\n- 3: 431-440: 10 pages\n- 4: 441-450: 10 pages\n- 5: 451-460: 10 pages\n- 6: 461-470: 10 pages\n- 7: 471-480: 10 pages\n- 8: 481-488: 8 pages\n\nSo in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Therefore, the total for tens place:\n\n4's: 40 (from 1-400) +10=50\n8's: 40 (from 1-400) +8=48\n\nWait, that makes sense because 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480 is included in 471-480, which is the tens digit 7, so 480 is part of 480-488, which is the tens digit 8. So 480 is included in 480-488, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages, but 480 is the first page with tens digit 8, so 480-488 is 9 pages, meaning 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it's 8 pages. Hmm, confusion here.\n\nWait, let's count: 480 is page 480, then 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 pages, right? From 480 to 488 inclusive, that's 9 pages. So the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So the count for 8's in the tens place from 401-488 is 9, not 8. So earlier, I was wrong in counting it as 8. So the correct count is 9.\n\nSo from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 40 +10=50\n8's:40 +9=49\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49\n- 8:49\n\nTens place:\n- 4:50\n- 8:49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4:89\n- 8:0\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=49+49=98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Full blocks of 10:48 blocks, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8 in units place:48 each.\n- Partial block 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n- Total units:48+1=49 for 4; same for 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Full hundreds (1-400):4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in tens place:4*10=40 each.\n- From 401-488: tens digits go from 0 to 8. 4 appears in 441-450:10 times. 8 appears in 480-488:9 times.\n- So total tens:40+10=50 for 4; 40+9=49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488:89 times.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many pages? 488-400+1=89 pages. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct. So 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo the total counts are as above.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, I can calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of those 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is the only one where the units digit is 4. That adds one more, so total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0-9 appearing 10 times in each cycle. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the last hundred is only up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. There are 5 hundreds (0-4), so 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check the last hundred, 400-488. The tens digit in 440-449 is 4, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's included. So total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers, so each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 4's in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus the extra in 484, so 49. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 89 numbers with 4 in the hundreds place. So 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, right? Because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last range, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, that's 4 ranges with 10 each, and 1 range with 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, so yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because earlier, for 4's, the hundreds place was 89, and for 8's, it's 0. So total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98.\n\nSo the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. So, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 10 each, and the last one, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So 4*10=40, plus 9 is 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, then 481 up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So yes, 9.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, we had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50, which seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the 4's hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's total: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding one more. So 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. The number of times 8 appears in the units place can be calculated as the number of times 8 is in the units digit from 1 to 488. The formula is floor(488/10)=48, and if the units digit is >=8, which it is, so we add 1. So 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the number of times 8 appears is calculated by looking at each hundred. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So in that case, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So for the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last hundred contributes 9. So 4*10 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total number of 8's is 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I was counting the units place for 4's, I had 49, but for 8's, I also have 49. But for the tens place, 4's had 50 and 8's had 49. So that adds up correctly.\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place for 8's again. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8, so 0 is correct.\n\nSo, in total, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by using a formula or a different counting method to confirm.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) =48, plus if the units digit of 488 is >=4, which it is (488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4), so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if units digit >=8, which it is, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, which represents the number of complete hundreds. But wait, 488/100=4.88, so floor is 4. But each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But wait, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit can go up to 8, so we need to check if the tens digit reaches 4 in that partial hundred.\n\nWait, no, because we're counting how many times the tens digit is 4. So in each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. But in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit can go up to 8, so the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before. So 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 40 +9=49.\n\nSo that's consistent with my earlier count.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0, but since we're dealing with 488, which is less than 1000, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nNumber of 8's: since 488 <800, there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 90, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers. So yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check 400 to 488: 400 is the first page, 488 is the last. So 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 8's in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, there are none.\n\nSo, yes, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When counting the units digit for 4's, I included 484 as one of the units digit 4's. But 484 is a three-digit number, so it's counted in both the hundreds and units place. But in my counting, I separated units, tens, and hundreds, so each digit is counted in its respective place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that in the units place, I didn't double-count any numbers. For example, 44 is counted once in the units place and once in the tens place, but in my counting, I handled each place separately, so that's okay.\n\nSo, after all that, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to look at each digit in every page number from 1 to 488 and count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are structured in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I need to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, I'll handle the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place goes from 0 to 9. Therefore, each digit, including 4 and 8, appears exactly once in the units place every 10 numbers.\n\nTo find the total number of 4's in the units place, I can calculate how many full sets of 10 are there in 488 pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the 4 appears once more in 484. Therefore, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, each full set of 10 has one 8. So, 48 full sets give 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. Therefore, the units digit 8 appears once more in 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times.\n\nSo, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4, and 4*10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I need to check the tens digit. Let's break this down.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so from 481-488, the tens digit is 8, but only for 8 numbers: 481-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear in 401-488?\n\nLooking at the breakdown, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450. That's 10 numbers: 441, 442, ..., 450. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nAdding that to the full hundreds, the total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place are 40 (from full hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. That's a difference of 2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 would have hundreds digit 4, right?\n\nWait, let me correct that. The hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, and 4 from 300-399, and then 400-488 is also hundreds digit 4. So, actually, 300-488 all have hundreds digit 4 or 3?\n\nWait, no, 300-399 have hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 have hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, let me clarify:\n\n- 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are one or two-digit numbers)\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, each page is printed once, starting from 1. So, page 1 is single-digit, page 10 is two-digit, etc. So, for the hundreds digit, it's only present in three-digit numbers, starting from 100.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488.\n\nNow, how many times does each hundreds digit appear?\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199, which is 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299, another 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399, another 100 numbers, so 100 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, we're only concerned with whether the digit is 4 or 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 times. And how many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have hundreds digit 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in all places.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's are printed than 8's, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 pages, units digit cycles every 10. 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight. So, 48 each, plus in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), units digits go from 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Full hundreds: 4 sets (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 in 481-488 (8 times). So, 40 +10=50 fours, and 40 +8=48 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the structure of the page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, 3-digit, or 4-digit numbers. Wait, but since the book has 488 pages, the highest page number is 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I don't need to worry about 4-digit page numbers here.\n\nI think the best approach is to separate the counting based on the number of digits in the page numbers. That is, I'll consider 1-digit page numbers (1-9), 2-digit page numbers (10-99), and 3-digit page numbers (100-488). For each of these groups, I'll count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place where applicable.\n\nStarting with 1-digit page numbers (1-9):\n- For the digit 4: It appears once, which is page 4.\n- For the digit 8: It appears once, which is page 8.\n\nSo, in the 1-digit range, both 4 and 8 appear once each. So far, the count is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, moving on to 2-digit page numbers (10-99):\nHere, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I'll need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nFirst, for the tens place:\n- The digit 4 in the tens place: This would be from 40 to 49. That's 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- The digit 8 in the tens place: Similarly, from 80 to 89. That's another 10 pages, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in 2-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 in the units place: This occurs once every 10 numbers. So, from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, but 44 has a 4 in both tens and units place, but I'm only counting the units place here, so it's still 9 times.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 in the units place: From 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times.\n\nWait, but 88 has an 8 in both tens and units place, but again, I'm only considering the units place here, so 9 times.\n\nSo, for 2-digit numbers, the count is:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I add the 1-digit and 2-digit counts, it might affect the total. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, in 2-digit numbers, the tens place for 4 is from 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8, it's 80-89, which is another 10 times. Then, in the units place, for 4, from 10-99, every 10 numbers has one 4, so 9 times (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, 90/10=9). Same for 8, 9 times.\n\nSo, 4's in 2-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19\n8's in 2-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nBut wait, when I add this to the 1-digit counts, I have:\n4's total so far: 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) = 20\n8's total so far: 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) = 20\n\nBut I know that in 3-digit numbers, there will be more 4's and 8's, so let's proceed.\n\nNow, moving on to 3-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488.\n\nIn 3-digit numbers, each page number has a hundreds place, a tens place, and a units place. So, I'll need to count 4's and 8's in each of these places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book ends at 488. So, 400-488 are the 4xx page numbers.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in 3-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, except when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n- In the hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: For each, the tens digit can be 4, and the units digit can be 0-9. So, for each of these hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 times per hundred. So, 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30 times.\n\n- Now, for the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, how many numbers are there? From 440 to 449, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 10 numbers. Therefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 400-488.\n\nWait, but wait, the tens digit can be 4 in 400-488, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 10 numbers. So, total 4's in the tens place for 3-digit numbers: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each can have a tens digit of 8, and the units digit from 0-9. So, 10 times per hundred, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The tens digit can go up to 8, so when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are from 480 to 488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct because in 400-488, the tens digit 8 can only go up to 488, which is 9 numbers, not 10.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in 3-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's in the units place:\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred (100-199, etc.) has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4 (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194). So, 10 per hundred, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit can be 4 in numbers like 404, 414, ..., 484. Now, how many such numbers are there? From 404 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 + 10\u00d78 = 484, so 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 484 is within 488, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the units place for 3-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nFor 8's in the units place:\n- For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 8 (e.g., 108, 118, ..., 198). So, 10 per hundred, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): The units digit can be 8 in numbers like 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Let's count them: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 408 + 10\u00d78 = 488, so 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers. So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: in 400-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? From 408, 418, ..., 488. Each step is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 408)/10) + 1 = (80/10)+1=8+1=9. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, putting it all together for 3-digit numbers:\n- 4's in hundreds place: 89\n- 4's in tens place: 40\n- 4's in units place: 39\nTotal 4's in 3-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0\n- 8's in tens place: 39\n- 8's in units place: 39\nTotal 8's in 3-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, let me check that again because earlier I thought 8's in tens place was 39 and units place was 39, so total 78. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all digit lengths.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- 1-digit: 1\n- 2-digit: 19\n- 3-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- 1-digit: 1\n- 2-digit: 19\n- 3-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 1-digit:\n- 4:1, 8:1. Correct.\n\n2-digit:\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Correct.\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times (14,24,...,94), 8 appears 9 times (18,28,...,98). Correct.\nSo, 4's:10+9=19, 8's:10+9=19. Correct.\n\n3-digit:\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4 appears 89 times (400-488). Correct.\n  - 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40. Correct.\n  - 8 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Correct.\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Correct.\n  - 8 appears 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. Correct.\n\nSo, 3-digit 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. Correct.\n3-digit 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any edge cases, especially in the 3-digit numbers. For example, when counting 4's in the units place in 400-488, I considered 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 numbers. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, 408, 418, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers. That seems correct because 408 + 10\u00d78 = 488, so 9 terms.\n\nAnother point to check: in the 3-digit tens place for 4's, I considered 100-399 as 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 30+10=40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit can only go up to 8, so when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, 30+9=39. Correct.\n\nI think all the counts are accurate. Therefore, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) across 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit page numbers.\n\n**1-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n- 4 appears once (page 4).\n- 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n**2-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n- **Tens Place:**\n  - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n  - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- **Units Place:**\n  - 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n  - 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n- **Total for 2-Digit:**\n  - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n  - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n**3-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n- **Hundreds Place:**\n  - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n  - 8 appears 0 times.\n- **Tens Place:**\n  - 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488).\n  - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n- **Units Place:**\n  - 4 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n  - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n- **Total for 3-Digit:**\n  - 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n  - 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 168 (3-digit) = 188.\n- **8's:** 1 (1-digit) + 19 (2-digit) + 78 (3-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a one, two, or three-digit number. I think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the totals for both, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Since the book has 488 pages, that's 48 full blocks of 10 pages each (because 480 divided by 10 is 48) and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nWait, no, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 complete decades and then 8 more pages. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1 (from each decade) plus one more if the last 8 pages include a 4 in the units place. Let me check: the last 8 pages are 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: each decade has one 8, so 48 times 1, and in the last 8 pages, 488 is the last page, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because the problem asks for how many more 4's than 8's. If both are 49, the difference would be zero, which seems unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, for each digit, 4 and 8, they each appear once every 10 numbers. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) = 48, and if the last partial decade (if any) includes a 4, we add 1. Since 488 ends with 8, the last page is 488, so the last partial decade is 481-488. The units digits here are 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place, it's also 48 times 1, plus in the last partial decade, 488 has an 8, so 48 +1=49. So, units place: 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each ten pages. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49). Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). \n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would also be 4*10=40 times. \n\nNow, what about the last partial hundred (401-488)? The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, the tens digit cycles through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. \n\nSo, in this partial hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, the last page is 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? Wait, 440 is less than 488, so yes, that's 10 pages. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this partial hundred. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial hundred.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. \n\nSo, total for tens place: 40 (from the full hundreds) +10 (from partial) =50 for 4's, and 40 +9=49 for 8's.\n\nWait, let me make sure. For the full hundreds (1-400), each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, total tens place: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, that's correct because 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit is only 1,2,3,4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because earlier I thought units place for both 4 and 8 was 49, which seems correct. Then tens place for 4 was 50 and for 8 was 49, and hundreds place for 4 was 89 and 0 for 8. So, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me recount the units place for 4 and 8.\n\nIn the units place, each block of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8. So, for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so 48 complete blocks. Each block contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Now, the remaining 8 pages are 481-488. Let's list the units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48+1=49 for 4's, and 48+1=49 for 8's. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens digit. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449 (10 times), and 8 appears from 480-488 (9 times). So, 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nAdding up, 4's:49+50+89=188, 8's:49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the hundreds place, are we only considering the hundreds digit? Yes, because we're counting how many times 4 and 8 appear in each digit place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for each digit place, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10 in 488: floor(488/10)=48. Each cycle contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nRemaining pages:488 - (48*10)=8 pages:481-488.\n\nIn these 8 pages, units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So, units place:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 100 in 488: floor(488/100)=4. Each cycle contributes 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each.\n\nRemaining pages:488 - (4*100)=88 pages:1-88.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the remaining pages after 400 would be 401-488, which is 88 pages. But when considering the tens place, we need to see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit from 401-488.\n\nIn the range 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4 8 8). So, the tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each possible tens digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 400-499, the tens digit cycles every 10 pages. But since we only go up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0:400-409, but since we start at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 pages, but wait, 400 is included in the hundreds place. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, from 401-488, the tens digit can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each tens digit d, the number of times it appears is 10, except for d=8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nWait, no, because 401-488 includes:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, but 401-410 is 10 pages, but 400 is not included here, so 401-410 is 10 pages, but 400 is already counted in the hundreds place. Wait, maybe this approach is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, in the range 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409 (10 pages), but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-409, which is 9 pages with tens digit 0. Then 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 pages. Similarly up to 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 pages. Then 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 pages.\n\nWait, but 400 is included in the hundreds place count, so in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0:401-409 (9 pages)\n- 1:410-419 (10)\n- 2:420-429 (10)\n- 3:430-439 (10)\n- 4:440-449 (10)\n- 5:450-459 (10)\n- 6:460-469 (10)\n- 7:470-479 (10)\n- 8:480-488 (9)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's=10, 8's=9.\n\nAdding to the 40 from the complete hundreds, we get 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit is 1 for 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, and 4 for 300-399 and 400-488.\n\nWait, no, 300-399 is hundreds digit 3, and 400-488 is hundreds digit 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, adding up:\n\n4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50+89=188.\n\n8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a three-digit number at most, right? Wait, actually, no. The first page is 1, which is a single digit, then from 10 onwards, it's two digits, and from 100 onwards, it's three digits. So I might need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how often each digit from 0 to 9 appears in each place. Maybe I can calculate the number of times 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and then do the same for 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in the units place, each digit appears once every 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, 0 appears from 1-9, then 10-19, 20-29, etc., up to 90-99. So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per 100 numbers.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 100 times in a block of 1000 numbers. But since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, because 400-488 is the range where the hundreds digit is 4. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but since we're starting at page 1, maybe we can ignore the hundreds digit for pages 1-99. So, the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99: no hundreds digit, pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, 400-488:4.\n\nSo, now, let me calculate the number of times 4 appears in each digit place, and then do the same for 8.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a remainder of 8 pages.\n\nSo, in each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 complete groups, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nNow, the remaining 8 pages are 481-488. Let me list the units digits for these: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 +1 =49. Units place 8's: 48 +1=49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for each 100 pages, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times.\n\nSo, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nSo, for each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same with 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, 4 appears 4*10=40 times, and 8 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is 401-488. Let's look at the tens digits here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in this range. Wait, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420:1, 421-430:2, 431-440:3, 441-450:4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, and 481-488:8.\n\nSo, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 401-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but only up to 488, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) +10=50.\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is only present from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there is no hundreds digit. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 +1 =89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in the range up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's:89, hundreds place 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:48\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's=49+48+0=97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units digits:49 for 4, 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens digit (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 times 10 is 40. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 40 times. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 times, so 10 more 4's. And the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more 8's. So, total tens digits: 4's=40+10=50, 8's=40+8=48. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place up to 488, so 0 times. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? So, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers:481-488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49. That's correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 for 4 and 40 for 8. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 times) and 8 in 481-488 (8 times). So, 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, total 4's:50+89=139? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, no, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and in the tens and units, 50 and 49 respectively. Wait, no, wait, no, no. Wait, no, the hundreds place is separate from the tens and units. So, the total 4's are units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 188. Similarly, 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) =97. So, 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but wait, in the hundreds place, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488, each of these blocks contributes to the hundreds digit. So, 100-199: 100 times 1, 200-299:100 times 2, 300-399:100 times 3, and 400-488:89 times 4. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 0 times for 8.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Then, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, 4's in tens place:10, 8's in tens place:8.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48.\n\nUnits place:49 each.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nLet me add up the 4's again:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:48\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97, so there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra pages.\n   - 4 appears 48 times in complete groups and once in the extra pages (484), totaling 49.\n   - 8 appears 48 times in complete groups and once in the extra pages (488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 pages mean 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred (401-488).\n   - 4 appears 40 times in complete hundreds and 10 times in 441-450, totaling 50.\n   - 8 appears 40 times in complete hundreds and 8 times in 481-488, totaling 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in pages 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place up to 488.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 up to 488. \n\nAlright, so I think I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nI remember that to count digits, it's helpful to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So I'll go through each place one by one for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets and then an extra 8 pages. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the number 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 4's: In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. There are four such sets in 488 pages (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. So that's five sets, but the last set (400-488) doesn't complete the full 100 numbers. Let me check: from 400-488, how many tens places have a 4? Well, the tens digit is 0 in 400-409, 1 in 410-419, and so on up to 8 in 480-488. So the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 times. So each full hundred contributes 10, and since we have four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), that's 4*10=40. Then the last partial hundred (400-488) also contributes 10, so total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 4's: In the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So hundreds place 4's are 89.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that addition: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place for 8's: Similar to 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's one more 8. So units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8's: In every set of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, specifically in the range x80-x89. So for each hundred, that's 10 times. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's five sets. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so the tens digit goes up to 8 in 480-488. So in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last set, 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9. So in the last partial hundred, it's 9 times. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the range 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 only when the page number is from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 49 + 49 is 98. Yes.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered each hundred contributing 10, and the last partial hundred contributing 9. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 4's, I had 50. Let me check that again. Each hundred contributes 10, and the last partial hundred (400-488) contributes 10 because 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So 4*10=40 + 10=50. Yes, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place of 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nSo 188 total 4's and 98 total 8's, so 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, there might be overlaps or miscalculations. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to consider each digit place separately and count how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n- For 4's: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then one more in 484, so 49.\n- For 8's: Similarly, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then one more in 488, so 49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n- For 4's: Every 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So in 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 40 + 10=50.\n- For 8's: Similarly, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So total 40 + 9=49.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- For 4's: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n- For 8's: The hundreds digit is 8 from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me count the number of 4's and 8's in a smaller range to see if my method works. Let's say a 20-page book.\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n- Units: 4,14 \u2192 2\n- Tens: 40-49, but since we only go up to 20, none. So total 2.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n- Units: 8,18 \u2192 2\n- Tens: 80-89, but up to 20, none. So total 2.\n\nDifference: 2 - 2 = 0. That seems correct.\n\nAnother example: 30-page book.\n\n4's:\n- Units: 4,14,24 \u2192 3\n- Tens: 40-49, but up to 30, none. So total 3.\n\n8's:\n- Units: 8,18,28 \u2192 3\n- Tens: 80-89, none. So total 3.\n\nDifference: 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 50-page book.\n\n4's:\n- Units: 4,14,24,34,44 \u2192 5\n- Tens: 40-49 \u2192 10\nTotal: 15\n\n8's:\n- Units: 8,18,28,38,48 \u2192 5\n- Tens: 40-49 has 48, but wait, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4, not 8. Wait, no, in 50 pages, the tens digit 8 would be in 80-89, which is beyond 50. So tens place 8's: 0\nTotal: 5\n\nDifference: 15 - 5 = 10. That seems correct because from 1-50, 4's appear more in the tens place.\n\nSo my method seems to work on smaller numbers, so I think it's correct for 488 pages.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds). Similarly, the count for the digit 8 is performed. \n\n- **4's Count**:\n  - Units place: 49 occurrences.\n  - Tens place: 50 occurrences.\n  - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences.\n  - **Total 4's**: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n- **8's Count**:\n  - Units place: 49 occurrences.\n  - Tens place: 49 occurrences.\n  - Hundreds place: 0 occurrences.\n  - **Total 8's**: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThe difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is either one, two, three, or four digits long. The digits we're interested in are 4 and 8. I need to count how many times each of these digits appears in all the page numbers and then find the difference between the counts.\n\nMaybe I should start by counting how many 4's there are. Let's think about each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and thousands. \n\nStarting with the units place: every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a page, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? The last page is 488, so the units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place would be 484. So yes, 48 times. \n\nBut wait, let me check. From 1 to 480, each set of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has one 4 in the units place. So 480 divided by 10 is 48, so 48 times.

The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 pages, for 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets. Each set has 10 pages, so 5 x 10 = 50. So 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 40-49: 10 pages, 4 in tens place. Then 140-149: another 10, and so on up to 440-449. That's five sets because 40, 140, 240, 340, 440. So yes, five sets, so 50 times.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but our book only goes up to 488, so it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, what about the thousands place? Since the book only has 488 pages, the thousands digit is 0 for all page numbers, so 4 never appears in the thousands place. So no 4's there.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: similar to 4, every 10 pages, 8 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 times. But wait, let me check if the last page, 488, has an 8 in the units place. Yes, 488 ends with 8, so that's the 48th occurrence. So 48 times.\n\nNow, the tens place: the digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. So how many sets do we have?\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 pages, 8 in tens place. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: that's 9 pages (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, 480 to 488 is 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So that's 4 full sets of 10 and one partial set of 9. So total in tens place: 4 x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 full tens and one partial, so 4 x 10 + 9 = 49. So 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: the digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there's no page number with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0 times.\n\nWhat about the thousands place? Again, all page numbers are less than 1000, so thousands digit is 0, so no 8's there.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. So 48 + 49 is 97. So 97 times 8 appears.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So total 4's:187, total 8's:97. So the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50 (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's five sets, 5x10=50)\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: that's four full sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4x10 +9=49)\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48 + 49 = 97. That also seems correct.\n\nSo the difference is 187 - 97 = 90. So 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 480-488, that's 9 pages, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So that's 9 pages, so 9 times 8 in the tens place. So yes, 4 full sets of 10, plus 9, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nI think the calculations are correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 pages, e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (in ranges 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (every 10 pages, e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (in ranges 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n\nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds. That makes sense because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated individually, and then I can sum them up. So, I'll start with the units place.\n\nFor the units place, how often does each digit appear? Well, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nNow, the book has 488 pages, so the total number of page numbers is 488. Let me figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488. Dividing 488 by 10 gives me 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, and the same for 8's, also 48. But wait, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, adding these up, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is included, so maybe I should check that again. Let me think: from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. How often does each digit appear in the tens place? Well, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers.\n\nNow, the book has 488 pages, so let's see how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times each digit. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, but only up to 88. Wait, no, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? Let's see, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be less. Wait, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go like this:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- 1: 411-420 (10 numbers)\n- 2: 421-430 (10 numbers)\n- 3: 431-440 (10 numbers)\n- 4: 441-450 (10 numbers)\n- 5: 451-460 (10 numbers)\n- 6: 461-470 (10 numbers)\n- 7: 471-480 (10 numbers)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this extra block. Therefore, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). \n\nSo, adding to the complete hundreds, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4*10 + 10 = 50, and the number of 8's is 4*10 + 8 = 48. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. The complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each for 4 and 8. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit for 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and for 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. How often does each digit appear in the hundreds place? Well, in a book with up to 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4. But page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many times? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8, on the other hand, does not appear in the hundreds place at all because the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake anywhere.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 48 full tens +1 =49\n- 8's: 48 full tens +1=49\nThat seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 10 in 441-450=50\n- 8's: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 8 in 481-488=48\nYes, that adds up.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\nYes.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nI think that's correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total units digits: 488\n   - Number of complete tens: 48 (480 pages)\n   - Remaining pages: 481-488 (8 pages)\n   - 4's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (484) = 49\n   - 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (488) = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400)\n   - Remaining pages: 401-488 (88 pages)\n   - 4's: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (441-450) = 50\n   - 8's: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 8 (481-488) = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 (400-488)\n   - 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right?\n\nLet me start by considering the different places where the digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I think I should calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 488, how many complete cycles of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete cycles and an extra 8 pages. In each complete cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48. Similarly, the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, there's an extra 8 pages beyond the 48 complete cycles, which are pages 481 to 488. In these extra pages, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So in this extra part, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so the units place contributes equally to both digits, so no difference there.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89. Now, since the book has 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So that's 4 times 10, which is 40 for 4's. Similarly, 8's appear 10 times in each hundred, so 4 times 10 is 40 for 8's. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see: pages 440-449 have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would be pages 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50. And 8's in the tens place are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial hundred) = 49. So the tens place contributes 50 4's and 49 8's, meaning 1 more 4 than 8 in this place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. Let's see how often each digit appears. \n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. From 200-299, it's 2, again no 4's or 8's. From 300-399, it's 3, same thing. Then from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's, meaning a significant difference here.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's), which equals 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nUnits place: 48 cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then 8 extra pages, contributing one 4 and one 8. So 48 + 1 = 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then in the last 88 pages, 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. No 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 for 4's. 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 for 8's. Difference is 90. Yes, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488. So, each page is a number from 1 to 488. Now, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to count the digits. I remember that when counting digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, I'll consider each place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nLet me calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (from 481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. \n\nBut wait, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal. \n\nHmm, interesting. So, the units place doesn't contribute to the difference. Let me move on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nNow, let's see how many complete blocks of 100 we have in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each block). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89 in each block). So, for 4 complete blocks, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, which is also 40.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial block from 401-488. The tens digits here range from 0 (for 401-410) to 8 (for 481-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nIn the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 440-449, but wait, our partial block is from 401-488. So, within this, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. However, since our upper limit is 488, we need to check if 449 is within 488. Yes, it is. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in the numbers 480-489, but our upper limit is 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 (from partial block) = 50. The total number of 8's is 40 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from partial block) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's, meaning 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the partial block 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So yes, 9 times. So, 10 vs. 9, so 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 numbers. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, it's 1, from 200-299, it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4.\n\nSo, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, the number of 4's is 89, and the number of 8's is 0. So, that's 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's tally up the total number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with the units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems quite a large number. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is in there, which is one more 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly for 8's, same logic: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place is correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach block of 100 contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full blocks (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each. Then, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place: numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, tens place is correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\n8's in hundreds place: none, since we only go up to 488. So, 0.\n\nThus, hundreds place is correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, so the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's. That seems right, but let me think again if I missed anything.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers. Let me check that: 488 - 400 = 88, but since we include both endpoints, it's 88 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the partial block, 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9.\n\nUnits place, same logic: 484 is the only 4 in the last partial block, so 1 more 4, and 488 is the only 8, so 1 more 8.\n\nSo, all the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers.\n   - 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full blocks and a partial block.\n   - 4's: 4*10 + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n   - 8's: 4*10 + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's: 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8's: 0 times.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, each page number is a three-digit number, right? Wait, no, actually, page numbers start at 1 and go up to 488, so some are one-digit, some are two-digit, and some are three-digit. So I need to consider all three cases: units place, tens place, and hundreds place for both 4 and 8.\n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each position. \n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. So that's 48 times. But wait, does the 48th set end at 480, and then we have 481 to 488. So in the units place, from 481 to 488, the digit 4 appears once more at 484. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, and so on. So how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete sets (each contributing 10 instances) and then a partial set from 400-488. So 4 sets give 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial set from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 times. So total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 0-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers. Then 100-199, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 200-299, 240-249 is 10, and 300-399, 340-349 is 10. Then from 400-488, 400-409 is 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds. That's 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. For every 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So similar to 4, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more at 488. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So how many such sets are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial set from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So that's 9 more times. So total for the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 0-99, 80-89 is 10. Then 100-199, 180-189 is 10. 200-299, 280-289 is 10. 300-399, 380-389 is 10. Then 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So that's 4*10=40 + 9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page numbers are 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds, which is 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So 49+49=98. That seems right.\n\nSo now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nSo 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. When counting the tens digit for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 400-409. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo the calculations seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and an extra 8 numbers (481-488), so 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 such sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-409), totaling 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, 48 full decades and an extra 8 numbers (481-488), so 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). There are 4 full sets (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), totaling 4 * 10 = 40 times. Additionally, from 400-488, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** Since the book ends at 488, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, each page number is a number from 1 up to 488. Now, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the count of 8's from the count of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the different positions where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I can analyze each digit position separately for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the digit 4. I'll go through each position one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):** For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place (the middle digit):** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For every block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks. Each block gives 10 4's, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit can be 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 4's. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that. From 1 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. So, yes, that's correct. I initially thought 4 blocks but realized there's a fifth block in 400-488. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the leftmost digit):** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 8, so 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** For the tens digit, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nLet me count the blocks:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, 9 8's in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because when I added up the 8's in the tens place, I got 49, and units place also 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full sets (48*1=48) and then in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes from 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as above, 5 blocks contributing 10,10,10,10,9, which totals 49. So, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For example, in 80-89, that's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. Similarly, 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. And 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, so total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, when I counted 4's in the hundreds place, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nFor the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing 1 4, so 48, and then in 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so no 4. So, 48 4's in units place.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, so total 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when counting, it's easy to overcount or undercount.\n\nWait, for the 8's in the tens place, let's list them:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289:10.\n- 380-389:10.\n- 480-488:9.\n\nYes, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nFor 4's, 187.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place, 488 is included? Wait, 488 is page number 488, which is included in the hundreds place count as 4 in the hundreds digit, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's using a formula.\n\nIn general, for a number with n digits, the count of a specific digit d in each position can be calculated.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, since 488 is a three-digit number, let's break it down.\n\nBut I think my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify the counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then 481-488: no 4's, so total 48.\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then 481-488: 488 has 8 in units place, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 5 blocks. The first four blocks have 10 each, the last block has 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0, as 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference: 187-98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me think again about the tens place for 8's. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 8's in tens place. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 full sets, 48, plus 488:1, total 49.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nYes, so 187-98=89.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 full sets, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.  \n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place.  \n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49).  \n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u21d2 4 full hundreds blocks (1-399) and one partial block (400-488).  \n   - Each full block contributes 10 \u00d7 4 = 40.  \n   - The partial block (400-488) includes 440-449, contributing another 10.  \n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.  \n   - 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.  \n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Every 10 numbers, 8 appears once.  \n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u21d2 48 full sets, contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.  \n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, contributing 1 more.  \n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Every 100 numbers, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 80-89).  \n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88 \u21d2 4 full hundreds blocks (1-399) and one partial block (400-488).  \n   - Each full block contributes 10 \u00d7 4 = 40.  \n   - The partial block (400-488) includes 480-488, contributing 9.  \n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Pages 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**  \n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. In this case, since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers will be 1-9 (one-digit), 10-99 (two-digit), and 100-488 (three-digit). \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nFor the units place:\n- From 1 to 488, every group of 10 consecutive numbers will have exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 will have a 4 in the units place, and 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 will have an 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, 488 is the last page, so I need to make sure I don't go beyond that. Let me calculate how many full groups of 10 there are in 488.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each full group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit is 4 once (484) and 8 once (488). So, adding those, we have 49 4's and 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 each. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So the units place doesn't contribute more 4's than 8's. Let's move on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place:\nAgain, I'll consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit.\n\nEach group of 100 numbers will have 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 10 numbers with an 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nLet me calculate how many full hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) make up the fifth partial hundred.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times (e.g., 40-49) and 8 exactly 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit here can be 0-8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each tens digit appears 10 times except the last one, which may be incomplete.\n\nWait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 only appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 4 in the tens place: This occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 4's in the tens place.\n\n- 8 in the tens place: This occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480 is included in 401-488, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that each tens digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for the last one, but that's not exactly correct because 488 is the end. So, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 (10)\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 (10)\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 (10)\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 (10)\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 (10)\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 (10)\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 (10)\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 401-488 is 88 numbers, and 10*8=80, plus 8 more, which is 88. So, actually, the tens digits from 0 to 8 each appear 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 8 times. Wait, no, that can't be because 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each 10 numbers) and 8 extra. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think that in the range 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing 8 times. So, for tens digit 4: 10 times, and for tens digit 8: 8 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 numbers with tens digit 8, but since 488 is the last page, it's 9 numbers, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 480 is included, so 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Total 4's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the partial hundred, so 50.\n- Total 8's: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in the partial hundred, so 49.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because in the partial hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, so 4*10=40 plus 9=49. Similarly, 4's in the tens place: 4*10=40 plus 10=50.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times. So, the tens place contributes 50-49=1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. Let's see how many numbers that is.\n\n400 to 488 is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nFor the hundreds digit 8: Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits go from 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought that in the tens place, 4's appeared 50 times and 8's appeared 49 times. But let me verify that again.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- Full hundreds (1-400): Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10=40 each.\n\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n\n- The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, both 4's and 8's appeared 49 times each.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's appeared 89 times, and 8's appeared 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems high.\n\nWait, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. But let me verify each component again.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's, correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, correct.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is the hundreds place correctly calculated?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, correct.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 49 8's, correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 188 4's and 98 8's, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place again. When I calculated the units place, I considered that from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), there's a 4 and an 8. So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449), and 8's: 9 (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nSo, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: maybe I'm overcounting in the hundreds place because when I consider 400-488, each of those pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, which is correct. So, 89 pages, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the hundreds place: none, correct.\n\nSo, yes, the total is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 consecutive numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 (1-480), contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total Units Place:**\n     - 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n     - 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - In 401-488:\n     - 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449)\n     - 8's in tens place: 9 (480-488)\n   - **Total Tens Place:**\n     - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Counting 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, each page has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n   - 8's in the hundreds place: 0 (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4's: 89\n     - 8's: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a number between 1 and 488. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are arranged in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, the 4 is in 4; in 11-20, it's in 14, and so on.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: For every 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n\nFor the hundreds place: Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, the digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from page 400 to 488. Let's calculate how many times that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, actually, each page number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 400 to 488 is indeed 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of 4's in the units and tens places.\n\nFirst, units place: For each 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full sets, with 8 extra numbers (since 48*10=480, and then 481-488 are the remaining 8). So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48*1=48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is included. So, 488 is the 488th page. So, when considering the units digit, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me think differently. For each ten's group, like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each of the 48 full groups (1-10, 11-20,..., 471-480), there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the last group, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so no 4's. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many 4's in the tens place? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 401 to 488. So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 48, in the tens place: 50, and in the hundreds place: 89. So, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 48 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. 48+50=98, plus 89 is 187. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think.\n\nWait, but when I'm calculating the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Then, in the tens place, for each hundred, 10 4's, so 4 hundreds would give 40, and then in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 more, so 50 total. Then, units place: 48 times. So, yes, 48+50+89=187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (1-10, 11-20,..., 481-490). But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the last block, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (in 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so in the last block, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (in 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 (from the first 480 pages) + 1 (from 481-488) = 49.\n\nNow, tens place for 8's: Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, from 1-100, 101-200, etc., each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds would give 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, how many 8's in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, the tens digit is 8 in these 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 in all of them, right? So, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has tens digit 8, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 more.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8's: The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4. So, the digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 1-400, in each hundred, 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40+9=49 in tens place. Units place: 49, so total 98.\n\nWait, but in the units place, I had 49, and in the tens place, 49, so 98 total 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in each place?\n\nFor units place 4's: Each 10 numbers, one 4. From 1-480, that's 48 sets, so 48 4's. Then, 481-488: units digits 1-8, so no 4's. So, 48 total.\n\nUnits place 8's: Each 10 numbers, one 8. From 1-480, that's 48 sets, so 48 8's. Then, 481-488: units digit 8 appears once (in 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place 4's: Each 100 numbers, 10 4's. From 1-400, that's 4 sets, so 40 4's. Then, 401-488: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTens place 8's: Each 100 numbers, 10 8's. From 1-400, that's 4 sets, so 40 8's. Then, 401-488: tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 89.\n\nHundreds place 8's: None, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks, giving 48 occurrences. The last 8 numbers (481-488) have no 4 in the units place. Total: 48.\n- **Tens place:** In each block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1 to 400, there are 4 blocks, giving 40 occurrences. From 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** In each block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks, giving 48 occurrences. From 481-488, 8 appears once (in 488). Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each block of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1 to 400, there are 4 blocks, giving 40 occurrences. From 401-488, 480-488 adds 9 more. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by considering how many digits each page number has. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Wait, 488 is a 3-digit number, so the page numbers go up to three digits. \n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for the full sets, plus one more time in the 484, 485, 486, 487, 488 range, right? Wait, no, because 484 is the 48th set. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, actually, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the 481-488 range, the next 4 in units place would be 484, which is within that range. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, so 484 is page 484, which is within 481-488. So, yes, units place 4's: 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, so 48 times 4 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but 488 is in the 400s. So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in the 40-49 range, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49 (1 block), 140-149 (another), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in every set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks are there?\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n\n180-189: another 10.\n\n280-289: another 10.\n\n380-389: another 10.\n\n480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, for the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488). Each full block contributes 10, so 4*10=40, and the partial block contributes 9, so 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 49 each, which seems correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets and one more in the last partial set.\n\nHundreds place for 4: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times. For 8, no numbers in the 800s, so 0.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the units place for 4, I included 484, which is correct, but when counting the units place for 8, I included 488, which is correct as well. So, both have 49 in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. The 440-449 block is entirely within 488, so that's 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the 480-488 block is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are accurate. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or a different counting method.\n\nAnother approach is to consider each digit place separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, which it is (488 ends with 8, which is >=4), so add 1 if the units digit is 4. Wait, no, actually, the formula is a bit different.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate for each digit place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\nfull_cycles = n // 10\n\nremainder = n % 10\n\ncount = full_cycles * 1\n\nif d <= remainder:\n    count += 1\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nfull_cycles = 488 // 10 = 48\n\nremainder = 8\n\nsince 4 <=8, count = 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfull_cycles=48\n\nremainder=8\n\nsince 8<=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nThe formula is similar but with higher magnitude.\n\nFor tens digit d:\n\nfull_cycles = n // 100\n\nremainder = (n // 10) % 10\n\ncount = full_cycles * 10\n\nif d <= remainder:\n    count += (d == remainder ? 10 : (remainder - d + 1) * 10)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, for the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 numbers, and each cycle has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, for d=4:\n\nNumber of full hundreds in 488: 4 (since 4*100=400, and 5*100=500 which is beyond 488).\n\nWait, actually, 488 // 100 =4, so full_cycles=4.\n\nEach full cycle contributes 10 occurrences of the digit in the tens place.\n\nSo, 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the partial cycle: from 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 400-488?\n\nFrom 400-409: tens digit 0\n\n410-419: 1\n\n420-429:2\n\n430-439:3\n\n440-449:4 (so 10 numbers)\n\n450-459:5\n\n460-469:6\n\n470-479:7\n\n480-488:8 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8 in the tens place:\n\nfull_cycles=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nPartial cycle: from 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40 +9=49.\n\nThat matches my earlier count.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nNumbers from 400-488: 488 -400 +1=89 numbers.\n\nSo, 89 occurrences.\n\nFor d=8:\n\nNumbers from 800-899, but since 488 <800, there are 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nThus, the total counts are as before: 4's=188, 8's=98, difference=90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page number is a number in that range. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the number of 4's. I think the best way is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits, so I'll need to check the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: for every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Since the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a page, we take the integer part, so 48 times. But wait, actually, when you divide 488 by 10, you get 48 full groups and 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times because in each group of 10, it appears once. But wait, let me think again: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is 48 because 488 / 10 is 48.8, but we only count the full cycles, so 48 times. But wait, actually, 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 would appear on page 484, which is the 48th time. So, units place: 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. How many such groups are there? From 1 to 488, how many hundreds do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, actually, each hundred block contributes a group where the tens digit is 4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there? From 1-100, 101-200, ..., up to 401-488. So, in the first hundred, 40-49 is 10 numbers, in the second hundred, 140-149, and so on. So, how many such groups? Well, from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, in each hundred, there's one group of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, that would be 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers. But wait, the last hundred is 400-488, so the tens digit 4 would be from 400-409, but 488 is beyond 409. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but in the hundreds place, it's 4. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but in the hundreds place, it's 4 for 400-488. Wait, no, I'm confusing hundreds and tens places.\n\nLet me clarify: the tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for numbers 40-49, the tens digit is 4. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 would be in the 400s, but 488 is less than 490, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, how many groups of 10 where the tens digit is 4? Let's see: 40-49 is the first group, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five groups. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does the tens digit 4 occur? The first group is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, 140-149: another 10. Then 240-249: another 10. Then 340-349: another 10. Then 440-449: another 10. So, that's five groups, each with 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers where the hundreds place is 4, which is 400-488. So, that's correct: 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as for 4: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, so 48 times. But wait, let me check: the last page is 488, so the units digit 8 appears on page 488, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 also count? But since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many full groups of 10 are there where the tens digit is 8?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five groups, but the last group only has 9 numbers. So, for each of the first four groups, there are 10 numbers, and the last group has 9. So, total times 8 appears in the tens place: 4 x 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 4 full groups and a partial group. So, 4 x 10 =40, plus 9, total 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place for 8 doesn't occur at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:48, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 48+49=97. So, 97 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal: 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place:48\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:48+49=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8 again. I said that 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. That's 4 groups of 10 and 1 group of 9, so 4*10=40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 groups, 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the case of 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a possibility that I've double-counted any digits? For example, in numbers like 444, does each digit get counted separately? Yes, because in 444, the hundreds, tens, and units digits are all 4, so each occurrence is counted in their respective places. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 488, the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit is 8, and the units digit is 8. So, each digit is counted in their respective places.\n\nSo, I think my approach is correct, and the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** Every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, so 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** Every 100 numbers, '4' appears in 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49). There are 5 such groups (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), contributing 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similarly, '8' appears 48 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four groups contribute 40 times, and the last group contributes 9 times, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Difference = Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 187 - 97 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the digits 1 through 9 appear once each, and 0 appears once. But since our book starts at page 1, I need to adjust for that. Wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, so maybe it's better to think in terms of complete blocks of 10, 100, etc., and then handle the remaining pages separately.\n\nLet me structure this by considering each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n1. **Units Digit:**\n   - For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - So, in 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8.\n   - So, in each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8.\n   - Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times 1 (for each group of 10) plus any additional in the remaining 8 pages.\n   - The remaining 8 pages would be from 481 to 488. Looking at the units digits here, the 4 appears once at 484 and the 8 appears once at 488. So, for the units place, we have 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences of 4 and 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences of 8. Wait, that's the same, so the difference here is zero.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The total number of complete groups of 10 is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages are 481 to 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding those, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, the difference in units place is 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Digit:**\n   - Now, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 in the tens place.\n   - So, for the tens digit, in 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? That's 4 (since 4*100=400) with a remainder of 88.\n   - So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - So, for each of the 4 complete blocks, we have 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. So that's 4*10 = 40 for each digit.\n   - Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens digit here. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, in 88 pages, how many complete tens cycles are there? 88 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 8. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 8 times, except for the last 8 pages where the tens digit goes from 8 to 8 (since 481-488: tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but we only go up to 488). Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens cycles (each 10 pages) and 8 extra pages. Each full cycle contributes one occurrence of 4 and one of 8 in the tens place. So, 8 occurrences each. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that in the range 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we stop at 488). So, for the tens digit, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times the tens digit is 4 in 401-488: it occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, but since 488 is the last page, it's 9 pages. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in 480-488.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 480-488, so the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in the tens place (from 480 to 488). So, in the tens place, in the incomplete block, 4 occurs 10 times (440-449) and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). Therefore, the total tens digit counts are:\n\n- For 4: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n- For 8: 4 blocks * 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but that seems off because the initial 4 blocks are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, right? So, in each of these blocks, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in each block). So, 4 blocks would give 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 8 in the tens place would occur 10 times per block, so 40 times.\n\nThen, in the incomplete block 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. The tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Digit:**\n   - Now, the hundreds digit. This is a bit trickier because it's only present in page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1 to 99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100 to 488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n   - Let's break it down. The hundreds digit is 1 from 100-199, 2 from 200-299, 3 from 300-399, and 4 from 400-488.\n\n   - We're interested in how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\n   - First, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\n   - Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers.\n\n   - Therefore, the count for 4 in the hundreds place is 89, and for 8, it's 0.\n\n   - So, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\n- Units place: 0\n- Tens place: 1\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check each step.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (48*10=480), so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. Difference: 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place. There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449 (10 times) and 8 occurs from 480-488 (9 times). So, total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. Difference: 1. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Difference: 89. That's correct.\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. Correct.\n\nIs there any chance I'm missing something? Maybe I should check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nTotal number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Digit:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Complete groups of 10: 48, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 4 and 1 8.\n   - Total units place: 49 4's, 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Digit:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete groups of 100: 4, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488): 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total tens place: 50 4's, 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Digit:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nSumming up:\n- Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers will be 1-9 (single-digit), 10-99 (two-digit), 100-488 (three-digit). I think I should analyze each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the only single-digit numbers that are 4 or 8 are 4 and 8 themselves. So, in single-digit pages, there's exactly one 4 and one 8. So, the count here is 1 for 4 and 1 for 8.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Now, two-digit numbers have a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider both places separately for the digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in two-digit numbers. The 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\n- When 4 is in the tens place: The numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n- When 4 is in the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, but 44 has two 4's, so does that affect the count? Hmm, actually, when we count each occurrence, 44 would contribute two 4's, but since we're counting all positions, the total number of 4's in the units place is 9, including 44. Similarly, in the tens place, 40-49 gives 10 4's, including 44. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but when I count 44, it's included in both the tens and units counts. So, actually, 44 is counted twice, but that's correct because it has two 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit pages: 19.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in two-digit numbers:\n\n- When 8 is in the tens place: The numbers are 80 to 89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place.\n- When 8 is in the units place: The numbers are 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 appears in the units place.\n\nAgain, 88 has two 8's, so it's included in both counts. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but that seems similar to the 4's. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. Wait, from 10 to 99, the tens digit can be 1-9, and the units digit 0-9. So, for each digit position, the count is as follows.\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 10 numbers (40-49).\n\nFor 4's in units place: For each ten's digit (1-9), there's a 4 in the units place once, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place, and for units place, 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers, so 9 4's. So total 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place, and 18,28,...,98, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in units place. So total 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both, so in total, 19 8's, same as 4's. So, in two-digit pages, 4's and 8's each appear 19 times.\n\nWait, but when I think about 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers. So, for each digit position, the count is 9 for units and 10 for tens, but perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, actually, for the units digit, in two-digit numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place (since there are 9 sets of ten: 10-19, 20-29, etc.), so 9 times for each digit. Similarly, for the tens digit, each digit from 1-9 appears exactly 10 times (e.g., 10-19 for 1, etc.). So, for 4's in units place: 9 times, and 10 times in tens place, so 19 total. Same for 8's.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so three-digit numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number.\n\nThree-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions across all three-digit page numbers from 100 to 488.\n\nLet me first consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since 488 is the highest page number. So, let's break it down by hundreds.\n\nFirst, hundreds digit 1: 100-199. So, 100 numbers here.\n\nHundreds digit 2: 200-299. 100 numbers.\n\nHundreds digit 3: 300-399. 100 numbers.\n\nHundreds digit 4: 400-488. So, 89 numbers here (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place:\n\n- Hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits go up to 4, and 8 is higher than 4. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place:\n\nFor three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, or 4. So, for each hundreds group, we can calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, each digit 0-9 appears once per ten numbers, so we can calculate accordingly.\n\nLet me start with the tens place:\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nBut for the last group, 400-488, we have to check if the tens digit reaches 8 or 4.\n\nWait, 400-488: The tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last number. So, let's see:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1,2,3: Each has 100 numbers, so the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each of these groups, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nBut for hundreds digit 4, the range is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit in this group goes from 0 to 8, but only up to 488, so let's check:\n\n- For tens digit 0: 400-409 (10 numbers)\n- 1: 410-419 (10)\n- 2: 420-429 (10)\n- 3: 430-439 (10)\n- 4: 440-449 (10)\n- 5: 450-459 (10)\n- 6: 460-469 (10)\n- 7: 470-479 (10)\n- 8: 480-488 (9 numbers)\n\nWait, so for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, but the last set (tens digit 8) only has 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers.\n- Digit 8 appears in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Digit 4:\n\n  - Hundreds 1: 10\n  - Hundreds 2: 10\n  - Hundreds 3: 10\n  - Hundreds 4: 10 (from 440-449)\n  - Total: 10+10+10+10 = 40\n\n- Digit 8:\n\n  - Hundreds 1: 10\n  - Hundreds 2: 10\n  - Hundreds 3: 10\n  - Hundreds 4: 9 (since only 480-488, which is 9 numbers)\n  - Total: 10+10+10+9 = 39\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place:\n\nFor each hundreds group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each group, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 1,2,3: Each has 100 numbers, so units digits 0-9 each appear 10 times. So, for each of these groups, 4 appears 10 times in units place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: The range is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, how many times do 4 and 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIn 400-488, each units digit from 0-9 appears how many times?\n\nWell, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let's see:\n\n- For units digits 0-9, each digit appears 9 times for the first 90 numbers (400-489), but since we only go up to 488, the last digit (8) appears one less time.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place from 400 to 488.\n\nThe total numbers are 89 (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nEach units digit from 0-9 appears floor(89/10) = 8 times, and then the remaining 9 numbers (since 89 = 8*10 +9) will have digits 0-8 appearing one more time.\n\nWait, actually, let me think differently. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers.\n\nNumber of complete cycles of 10: 8 (since 8*10=80), and then 9 remaining numbers (480-488).\n\nIn each complete cycle, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, 8 cycles mean each digit appears 8 times.\n\nThen, in the remaining 9 numbers (480-488), the units digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing once. So, digits 0-8 get an extra count, and 9 does not.\n\nTherefore, for units place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Digit 4: appears 8 (from cycles) + 1 (from 484) = 9 times\n- Digit 8: appears 8 (from cycles) +1 (from 488) = 9 times\n- Digits 0-7: 9 times each\n- Digit 9: 8 times\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so in the remaining 9 numbers, the units digits are 0-8, so 8 appears once more, making it 9 times total.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 appears once in the units place in the remaining 9 numbers (at 484), so 8 +1=9.\n\nSo, for units place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4: 9 times\n- 8: 9 times\n\nTherefore, across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Units place for 4:\n\n  - Hundreds 1:10\n  - Hundreds 2:10\n  - Hundreds 3:10\n  - Hundreds 4:9\n  - Total: 10+10+10+9=39\n\n- Units place for 8:\n\n  - Hundreds 1:10\n  - Hundreds 2:10\n  - Hundreds 3:10\n  - Hundreds 4:9\n  - Total:10+10+10+9=39\n\nWait, that can't be right because in hundreds digit 4, units digit 8 appears 9 times, as calculated. So, the total for units place would be 39 for both 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each has 100 numbers, so units digits 0-9 each appear 10 times, so 10 times for 4 and 10 for 8 in each of these groups. So, 3 groups *10=30 for 4 and 30 for 8. Then, for hundreds digit 4, units digits 4 and 8 each appear 9 times, so total for 4: 30+9=39, and for 8:30+9=39.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, now, summarizing the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nWait, for hundreds place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears in hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (hundreds 2) +10 (hundreds 3) +10 (hundreds 4, 440-449) = 40.\n\n- For 8: 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (hundreds 2) +10 (hundreds 3) +9 (hundreds 4, 480-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4: 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (hundreds 2) +10 (hundreds 3) +9 (hundreds 4) =39.\n\n- For 8: 10 (hundreds 1) +10 (hundreds 2) +10 (hundreds 3) +9 (hundreds 4) =39.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) = 168.\n\n- 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units) =78.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's total up all the digits across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, let's sum up the counts for 4's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:168\n- Total 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\n- Total 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 =90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n\n- 4:1, 8:1. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's:19, 8's:19. Correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8:0.\n\n- Tens place:4 appears 40, 8:39.\n\n- Units place:4 appears 39, 8:39.\n\nSo, 4's:89+40+39=168.\n\n8's:0+39+39=78.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once.\n   - '8' appears once.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - Each digit appears 19 times for both '4' and '8'.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears 89 times; '8' does not appear.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 40 times; '8' appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** Both '4' and '8' appear 39 times.\n\nSumming these up:\n- Total '4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing to do is to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each place.\n\n**Units Place:**\nIn the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and an extra 8 numbers. In each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here because 484 is beyond 488? Wait, no, 484 is within 488, right? Wait, no, 484 is page 484, which is within 488. So, actually, the units digit 4 appears once more in the last group, making it 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, and the last term is 484. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nNow, for the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are up to 488.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3,4 because 488 is less than 500. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 because 400-488 is the last set.\n\nSo, for the tens place being 4:\n\n- When the hundreds digit is 0: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n- When the hundreds digit is 1: 140-149: another 10 times.\n- When the hundreds digit is 2: 240-249: another 10 times.\n- When the hundreds digit is 3: 340-349: another 10 times.\n- When the hundreds digit is 4: Now, we need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10 times.\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit 4 goes up to 449, which is page 449, and then the next page is 450, so yes, 440-449 is valid. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nNow, let me add up the total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each place.\n\n**Units Place:**\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place. It appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Wait, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is page 488, so units digit is 8. So, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 8,18,...,488. How many steps? Each step is 10. So, from 8 to 488, the number of steps is (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48. So, 48 steps, which means 49 numbers. Yes, correct.\n\n**Tens Place:**\nNow, for the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block contributes 10 occurrences.\n\nLet's see how many such blocks there are up to 488.\n\n- Hundreds digit 0: 80-89: 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 1: 180-189: 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 2: 280-289: 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: 380-389: 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, we need to check if 480-489 is within 488. Yes, up to 488. So, 480-488: that's 9 numbers, right? Because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, 9 times instead of 10.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (from hundreds 0 to 3) and 1 block of 9 (from hundreds 4). So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, correct.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4's: 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 50 times. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, up to 488, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, etc.) and one partial block (480-488), which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nUnits place for both 4 and 8: 49 each, which seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any overlap or if I double-counted anywhere. For example, in the number 484, it has a 4 in the units and hundreds place, but I counted each occurrence separately, so that's correct. Similarly, 448 has a 4 in hundreds and tens place, which is also correctly counted.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer should be 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units Place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens Place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds Place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units Place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens Place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds Place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nSo, let's start by considering how page numbers are formed. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means we'll have page numbers from 1 to 9 (one-digit), 10 to 99 (two-digit), and 100 to 488 (three-digit numbers). \n\nI think I should handle each digit position separately\u2014units place, tens place, and hundreds place\u2014because the occurrence of digits can vary in each position. Let me start with the units place.\n\n**Units Place:**\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place as we count upwards. So, for every block of 10 numbers, each digit appears once. \n\nLet's see how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's. \n\nNow, the last partial block is from 481 to 488. Let's list the units digits here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nTherefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from the partial block) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. The last page is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the partial block, 481 to 488, units digits are 1 through 8. So yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place gives us 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. \n\nSo, for the tens place, let's figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFirst, let's determine how many complete hundreds we have in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an incomplete hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, each tens digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 occurrences, and the same for 8. \n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40. Similarly, 8's in the tens place are also 40. \n\nNow, let's look at the incomplete hundred from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 numbers. So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times (since 488 is the last page). \n\nWait, let me think again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nWait, so from 401 to 488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, except for the last one, which is 8, appearing only 8 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, 481-490 would be the next set, but since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this incomplete hundred.\n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from incomplete hundred) = 50. \n\nSimilarly, the total number of 8's in the tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from incomplete hundred) = 48. \n\nWait, let me check that again. For the incomplete hundred (401-488), each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, for 4, it's 10 times, and for 8, it's 8 times. So, yes, 4's in the tens place add 10, making it 50, and 8's add 8, making it 48. \n\nSo, in the tens place, we have 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. \n\nLet's see, the hundreds digit cycles every 1000 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, the hundreds digits can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nSpecifically, the hundreds digit is:\n\n- 1 for pages 100-199\n- 2 for pages 200-299\n- 3 for pages 300-399\n- 4 for pages 400-488\n\nSo, each hundreds digit from 1 to 4 appears a certain number of times. \n\nLet's count how many times each hundreds digit appears:\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488, which is 89 numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89)\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times, and the digit 8 does not appear at all because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.**\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = Let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 48 is 97, correct. \n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 97. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188 - 97 = 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFirst, let's verify the units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. \n\nNumber of complete decades (blocks of 10) in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and the remaining 8 numbers are 481-488.\n\nIn each complete decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 decades give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each tens digit. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place.\n\n- The incomplete hundred (401-488) has tens digits from 0 to 8. \n\nWait, but from 401-488, how many times does each tens digit appear?\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place: 89\n8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by considering each digit position separately again or using a formula.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count of a specific digit can be calculated by:\n\n- For the units place: For every 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, total units digits = floor(488 / 10) * 10 + min(488 % 10, 9) - but wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, as we did before, count how many complete cycles and then the partial cycle.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for 488, it's floor(488 / 100) * 10 + ... Hmm, maybe it's better to stick with the initial method.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting.\n\nThe formula for counting the number of times a digit 'd' appears in the units place up to N is:\n\nunits_count = (N // 10) * 1 + min(N % 10, 9) if d != 0 else (N // 10) * 1 + (N % 10 >= 0 ? 1 : 0)\n\nWait, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, the count can be calculated as:\n\ncount = higher * current_place + (if current digit > target, add current_place; else if current digit == target, add (lower + 1))\n\nWait, maybe that's more efficient. Let me try that.\n\nLet me recall the standard method for counting digit occurrences.\n\nFor a specific digit d in a specific position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated as:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the position as 'pos' (starting from 0 for units, 1 for tens, etc.), and the divisor as 10^(pos+1) and 10^pos.\n\nFor each position pos:\n\n- higher = N // (10^(pos+1))\n- current = (N // 10^pos) % 10\n- lower = N % 10^pos\n\nIf current > d, then count += (higher + 1) * 10^pos\nIf current == d, then count += (higher) * 10^pos + lower + 1\nIf current < d, then count += higher * 10^pos\n\nBut this is for counting the digit d in the pos-th position across all numbers from 0 to N. Since our page numbers start at 1, we might need to adjust, but perhaps it's negligible for large N.\n\nLet me try this for d=4 and d=8 in each position.\n\nFirst, let's compute for d=4.\n\n**Units place (pos=0):**\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\ncurrent = (488 // 1) % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 1 = 0\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count_units_4 = (48 + 1) * 1 = 49 * 1 = 49\n\n**Tens place (pos=1):**\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > d (4), count_tens_4 = (4 + 1) * 10 = 5 * 10 = 50\n\n**Hundreds place (pos=2):**\n\nhigher = 488 // 1000 = 0\ncurrent = (488 // 100) % 10 = 4\nlower = 488 % 100 = 88\n\nSince current (4) == d (4), count_hundreds_4 = 0 * 100 + 88 + 1 = 0 + 89 = 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, for d=8:\n\n**Units place (pos=0):**\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\ncurrent = 8\nlower = 0\n\ncurrent (8) >= d (8), so count_units_8 = (48) * 1 + (0 + 1) = 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, no, the formula says:\n\nIf current > d: count += (higher +1) * 10^pos\n\nIf current == d: count += higher * 10^pos + lower +1\n\nIf current < d: count += higher * 10^pos\n\nSo, for units place, d=8:\n\nhigher = 48, current=8, lower=0\n\nSince current == d, count_units_8 = 48 * 1 + 0 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens place (pos=1):**\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current == d (8), count_tens_8 = 4 * 10 + 8 + 1 = 40 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted manually, I got 48 for tens place 8's. Hmm, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check.\n\nWait, using the formula, for tens place, d=8:\n\nhigher = 4, current=8, lower=8\n\nSo, count_tens_8 = 4 * 10 + 8 + 1 = 40 + 9 = 49\n\nBut earlier, when I counted manually, I thought that in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the incomplete hundred (401-488), so total tens place 8's would be 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 49. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's think again. From 1-400, each tens digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 8's in tens place are 40.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place 8's should be 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 49. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, the formula counts from 0 to N, but our page numbers start at 1, so perhaps the formula is including 0, which isn't part of our page numbers. Wait, but in our case, the page numbers are from 1 to 488, so 0 is not included. So, perhaps the formula is slightly off because it includes 0, but we need to adjust.\n\nWait, let's check the formula again. The formula counts from 0 to N, but our page numbers start at 1. So, for units place, when N=488, the formula gives 49, which is correct because from 1-488, units digits 0-9 each appear 49 times (since 488 is included). Wait, but 488 is even, so units digits 0-9 would have appeared 49 times each, except for 0, which appears 48 times because 0 isn't in the units place for 1-488. Wait, no, 0 appears in the units place for 10, 20, ..., 480, which is 48 times. So, the formula might not be directly applicable here because it's counting from 0, which would have an extra 0 in the units place.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the formula to account for starting at 1 instead of 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me try again.\n\nFor the tens place, d=8:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current == d, count = higher * 10 + lower + 1 = 4*10 +8+1=49.\n\nBut in reality, from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears 49 times? Let's check.\n\nFrom 0-488, the tens digit 8 would appear 49 times, but since we're starting from 1, does that affect it?\n\nWait, 0 isn't included, so in the range 1-488, the number 00-09 isn't present, but 10-19, etc., are. So, the tens digit 8 in 0-488 is 49 times, but in 1-488, it's the same because 00-09 don't contribute any tens digit 8. So, perhaps the formula is correct, and I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, let me list the numbers where the tens digit is 8 from 1-488.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480-488, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we stop at 488, so 9 numbers.\n\nWait, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nAh, so I was wrong earlier. It's actually 49 times. So, the formula is correct, and my initial manual count was wrong. I thought that in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, but actually, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Wait, but 480 is part of the 400-488 range, so yes, 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the incomplete hundred, making the total tens digit 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from incomplete hundred) = 49.\n\nSo, my initial manual count was wrong because I thought 481-488 was 8 numbers, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in that range. Therefore, the formula is correct, and the total tens digit 8's are 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 numbers, but 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, that's where the mistake was. So, the correct count for tens digit 8's is 49, not 48.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place, d=8:\n\nSince the hundreds digit goes up to 4, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place, so count is 0.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 97. Wait, no, let's recalculate.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the counts. Let me go back.\n\nWait, when I used the formula for d=8, units place gave 49, tens place gave 49, and hundreds place 0, so total 8's would be 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nBut earlier, when I was manually counting, I thought units place was 49, tens place was 48, and hundreds place 0, totaling 97. But that was because I miscalculated the tens place as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct total 8's are 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\n- 80-89: 10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotal: 10+10+10+10+9=49\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the total 8's in the tens place are 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nWait, but earlier when I was using the initial method, I thought units place was 49, tens place was 48, and hundreds place 0, totaling 97. But that was incorrect because I miscalculated the tens place as 48 instead of 49. So, the correct total 8's are 98.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but that was because I had miscalculated the 8's as 97 instead of 98. So, the correct difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, this is conflicting with my initial calculation. So, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let's go back.\n\nUsing the formula for d=8:\n\nUnits place: higher=48, current=8, lower=0\n\nSince current == d, count_units_8 = higher * 1 + lower +1 = 48*1 +0 +1=49\n\nTens place: higher=4, current=8, lower=8\n\nSince current == d, count_tens_8 = higher*10 + lower +1=4*10 +8 +1=49\n\nHundreds place: higher=0, current=4, lower=88\n\nSince current < d (4 < 8), count_hundreds_8=0*100=0\n\nSo, total 8's=49+49+0=98\n\nFor d=4:\n\nUnits place: higher=48, current=8, lower=0\n\nSince current > d, count_units_4=(48 +1)*1=49\n\nTens place: higher=4, current=8, lower=8\n\nSince current > d, count_tens_4=(4 +1)*10=50\n\nHundreds place: higher=0, current=4, lower=88\n\nSince current == d, count_hundreds_4=0*100 +88 +1=89\n\nTotal 4's=49+50+89=188\n\nSo, difference=188-98=90\n\nWait, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier, when I was manually counting, I thought the tens digit 8's were 48, leading to total 8's as 97, and 4's as 188, giving a difference of 91. But that was wrong because I miscalculated the tens digit 8's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me verify this with a different approach.\n\nLet me list all the page numbers and count the 4's and 8's manually for a smaller range to see if the formula works.\n\nFor example, let's take N=88.\n\nUsing the formula for d=4:\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher=8, current=8, lower=0\n\nSince current >4, count_units_4=(8 +1)*1=9\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=0, current=8, lower=8\n\nSince current >4, count_tens_4=(0 +1)*10=10\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 4's=9+10=19\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nUnits place:\n\nhigher=8, current=8, lower=0\n\nSince current==8, count_units_8=8*1 +0 +1=9\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=0, current=8, lower=8\n\nSince current==8, count_tens_8=0*10 +8 +1=9\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's=9+9=18\n\nDifference=19-18=1\n\nBut in reality, from 1-88, how many 4's and 8's are there?\n\nUnits place: each digit 0-9 appears 8 times (since 88//10=8). So, 4 appears 8 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but 88 is included, so units digits go up to 8, so 4 appears 8 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTens place: from 1-88, the tens digits go from 0 (1-9) to 8 (80-88). So, for each tens digit, 1-8, each appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times (80-88).\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:10 times (40-49)\n8's in tens place:9 times (80-88)\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\nUnits:8\nTens:10\nHundreds:0\nTotal=18\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:8\nTens:9\nHundreds:0\nTotal=17\n\nDifference=18-17=1\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it was 19-18=1, which matches. So, the formula seems correct.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, for d=4, total was 19, but actual count is 18. Hmm, that's a discrepancy.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts from 0 to N, which includes 0, but our page numbers start at 1. So, for units place, 0 isn't included, so the formula overcounts by 1 for units place when d=0, but for other digits, it's accurate.\n\nWait, in the case of N=88, d=4:\n\nUnits place: formula gives 9, actual is 8 (since 0 isn't included)\n\nTens place: formula gives 10, actual is 10 (40-49)\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal=8+10=18, which matches actual count.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nUnits place: formula gives 9, actual is 8\n\nTens place: formula gives 9, actual is 9\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal=8+9=17, which matches actual count.\n\nSo, the formula overcounts by 1 in units place when d\u22600 because it includes 0. So, to adjust, for units place, we need to subtract 1 if d\u22600.\n\nWait, but in our case, d=4 and d=8, so we need to adjust the units place counts by subtracting 1.\n\nSo, for N=88, d=4:\n\nUnits place:9-1=8\n\nTens place:10\n\nTotal=18\n\nSimilarly, d=8:\n\nUnits place:9-1=8\n\nTens place:9\n\nTotal=17\n\nSo, the formula gives correct results when we subtract 1 from units place counts for d\u22600.\n\nTherefore, in our original problem, when using the formula, we should adjust the units place counts by subtracting 1 for d=4 and d=8.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\nFor d=4:\n\nUnits place: formula gave 49, but actual is 49 -1=48\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal 4's=48+50+89=187\n\nFor d=8:\n\nUnits place: formula gave 49, actual is 49 -1=48\n\nTens place:49\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal 8's=48+49=97\n\nSo, difference=187-97=90\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nBut earlier, when I manually counted without the formula, I had:\n\n4's=188, 8's=97, difference=91\n\nBut with the formula, after adjusting for units place overcount, it's 4's=187, 8's=97, difference=90.\n\nBut when I tested with N=88, the formula overcounted units place by 1 for d\u22600, so I need to subtract 1 from units place counts.\n\nSo, in our problem, units place counts for d=4 and d=8 should each be reduced by 1.\n\nSo, units place for 4's:49-1=48\n\nUnits place for 8's:49-1=48\n\nThen, tens place as per formula:\n\nFor d=4:50\n\nFor d=8:49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor d=4:89\n\nFor d=8:0\n\nSo, total 4's=48+50+89=187\n\nTotal 8's=48+49+0=97\n\nDifference=187-97=90\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was manually counting, I had:\n\nUnits place 4's=49, 8's=49\n\nTens place 4's=50, 8's=49\n\nHundreds place 4's=89, 8's=0\n\nSo, total 4's=49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's=49+49+0=98\n\nDifference=188-98=90\n\nWait, that's consistent. So, the difference is 90.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think earlier confusion was due to miscalculating the tens place for 8's as 48 instead of 49, but after correcting that and adjusting for the formula"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page is a number in that range. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits place by place. That is, I'll look at the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately because each can contribute to the count of 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nNow, how many such blocks of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. That gives us 48 occurrences of 4 and 48 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nBut wait, we have those extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page. Pages 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits in this range. The units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so in the units place, they're equal. That's interesting.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for exactly 10 numbers (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 full hundreds, both 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences for 4 and 4 * 10 = 40 for 8.\n\nNow, let's check the extra 88 pages from 401 to 488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (for 401-409) to 8 (for 480-488). So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers if we count from 480 to 488 inclusive, but actually, that's 9 pages because 480 is the first, 481 is the second, up to 488, which is the 9th. Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 pages? Let me check: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Yes, that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in this extra range.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (in 480-488). So, adding to the previous counts, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The extra 88 pages start at 401. So, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers as I thought. So, yes, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8 in the tens place in the extra 88 pages. So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears in pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 occurrences for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 is 90, but I think I might have miscalculated somewhere. Let me go through each digit again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place. Let me check the units digits again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach block of 10 pages has one 4 in the units place. There are 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: Each block of 10 has one 8, so 48 times, plus in 481-488, 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4 in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor 4: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nFor 8: No hundreds digit is 8 in 1-488, so 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the hundreds place for 4 was 89, but when I add up, 49 + 50 + 89 is indeed 188. And 8's are 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When considering the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and units 49 times. So, yes, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. So, 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the hundreds digit for 4 was 89, which seems correct, but maybe I missed something else. Let me cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: As before, 49.\n- Tens place: 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n- Tens place: 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 48 full blocks (1-480) give 48 each.\n- Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contains 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place and 10 with an 8.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n- Pages 401-488 add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n- No page has an 8 in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89.\n- Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the page numbers go from 1 to 488, right? So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the digits in the units place and then the tens place separately. Maybe I can handle each place value one by one.\n\nFirst, let's think about the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, for each digit, the number of times it appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete sets of ten in 488 pages.\n\nWait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, for each digit, in the units place, it appears 48 times. But wait, for 4 and 8, does this hold?\n\nYes, because in each set of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 4, that's 48 times, and for 8, that's also 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place in this partial set? Let me check. 484 is in this range, so yes, 4 appears once more in the units place. Similarly, 488 is in this range, so 8 appears once more in the units place.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me think again. The last full set is 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488. So, from 480 to 488, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, the count for 4 is 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1, making it 49. Similarly, for 8, it's 48 plus 1, so 49 as well. Hmm, but wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8, but does 488 count as a page? Yes, so 488 is included.\n\nWait, so in the units place, 4 appears 49 times and 8 appears 49 times? Hmm, that seems correct because each complete set of ten contributes one 4 and one 8, and the last partial set adds one more 4 and one more 8.\n\nWait, but let me check with smaller numbers to make sure. Let's say we have a 14-page book. The units digits go from 1 to 4. So, 4 appears once in the units place (at 4), and 8 doesn't appear at all because we only go up to 14. Wait, but in this case, 8 doesn't appear, but in our problem, the book has 488 pages, so 8 does appear in the units place in the last partial set. So, perhaps my initial thought was correct.\n\nWait, but let's go back. So, for the units place, 4 appears 49 times and 8 appears 49 times. Hmm, but let's check with a smaller example to see if this approach is correct.\n\nTake a 20-page book. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears twice in the units place (once in 1-10 and once in 11-20). So, 4 appears twice, 8 appears twice. Now, if the book had 22 pages, then the units digits go up to 2. So, in the units place, 4 would appear twice (4 and 14), and 8 would not appear at all because 18 is beyond 22. Wait, no, 18 is less than 22, so 8 would appear once in the units place (at 8 and 18). Wait, no, 8 is in 8 and 18, so that's two times. Wait, but 22 is the last page, so 18 is included, so 8 appears twice in the units place. Hmm, so in the units place, for a 22-page book, 4 appears twice (4 and 14) and 8 appears twice (8 and 18). So, the count is correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial problem, the book has 488 pages, so the units digits go up to 8 in the last partial set. So, 4 appears once more in the units place (at 484) and 8 appears once more (at 488). Therefore, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but that would mean that in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. So, the difference in the units place is zero. Hmm, maybe I should check this again.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The number of complete sets of ten in 488 pages is 48, because 48 * 10 = 480, and then we have 8 more pages (481-488). So, in each complete set of ten, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for 4, that's 48 times, and for 8, that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, the count in the units place is the same for both digits, so the difference here is zero.\n\nNow, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, digits change every ten numbers. So, for example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nWait, but let me think carefully. For a 488-page book, how does the tens place work?\n\nFirst, let's break down the page numbers into hundreds, tens, and units. The pages go from 001 to 488, but we can ignore leading zeros since page numbers don't have them. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, 100-488 are three-digit.\n\nSo, for the tens place, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\nFrom 1-99: The tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4, that's 10 times, and for 8, that's 10 times.\n\nFrom 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 again for each hundred. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, from 200-299: Same thing, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 300-399: Same, each digit appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: Now, this is where it's a bit different because we don't go up to 499, but only to 488. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the tens digit cycles from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit in the tens place goes from 0 to 8. So, each digit from 0 to 8 appears how many times?\n\nWait, let's see. From 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409 (10 pages), 1 for 410-419 (10 pages), ..., up to 8 for 480-488 (9 pages, since 488 is the last page). So, digits 0 through 7 appear 10 times each in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). Wait, but wait, the tens digit for 480-488 is 8, right? So, that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 100-399: Each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit, so 3 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) would be 3 * 10 = 30 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 400-488: 10 times for 4 in the tens place (440-449) and 9 times for 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n4 appears 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\n8 appears 10 (from 1-99) + 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from units and tens places.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 99, and the number of 8's is 98. So, there's 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each set of 10 pages contributes 1 occurrence of each digit in the units place.\n\n- 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10 (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\n- So, in each full set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each.\n\n- In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\n- So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-99: each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\n- From 100-399: 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 30 times each.\n\n- From 400-488: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\n- So, total tens place: 10 + 30 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 10 + 30 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nDifference: 99 - 98 = 1.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe there was a mistake because sometimes when counting, it's easy to miscount, but let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: Now, do we have any 4's in the hundreds place?\n\nYes, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, so earlier, I didn't consider the hundreds place. Oh no, that's a mistake! I only considered units and tens places, but I forgot about the hundreds place.\n\nSo, I need to add that in.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, does the hundreds digit ever appear? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit is either 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't have pages beyond 488. So, 8's only appear in the units and tens places.\n\nSo, correcting my earlier calculation:\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 49\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's a big difference. So, I made a mistake earlier by not considering the hundreds place. That's a crucial error. So, I need to correct that.\n\nLet me go through it again more carefully.\n\nFirst, total number of 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 50\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n\n- Tens place: 49\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct now. So, I initially forgot to consider the hundreds place, which is why I was getting a difference of 1. But now, considering the hundreds place, the difference is 90.\n\nLet me verify this with another approach.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each place is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears in that position across all page numbers.\n\nSo, for the units place, as before, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in the units place, except possibly in the last partial set.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in the tens place, except in the last partial set if the number of pages doesn't complete a full set of ten in that tens place.\n\nAnd for the hundreds place, digits can appear more or less depending on the range of the book.\n\nSo, let's recast the problem:\n\nTotal number of pages: 488.\n\nWe need to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) and sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nNumber of complete sets of ten in 488 pages: floor(488 / 10) = 48 sets.\n\nEach set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each.\n\nNow, the remaining pages: 488 - (48 * 10) = 8 pages (481-488).\n\nIn these 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8.\n\nSo, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nThus, units place total:\n\n4: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nTens place:\n\nEach complete set of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488 pages: floor(488 / 100) = 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, the remaining pages after 400: 488 - 400 = 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn these 88 pages, the tens digit cycles from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (401-410, ..., 471-480) and then 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so 401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 is 10, ..., up to 471-480 is 10, and then 481-488 is 8 pages.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480).\n\n- Tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nWait, no, because 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the last partial set.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 401-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (in 441-450).\n\n- 8 appears 8 times (in 481-488).\n\nTherefore, total tens place:\n\n4: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\n8: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 49, but now I'm getting 48. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recast this.\n\nWait, from 1-400, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 (10 pages)\n\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 (10 pages)\n\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 (10 pages)\n\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 (10 pages)\n\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 (10 pages)\n\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 (10 pages)\n\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 (10 pages)\n\n- Tens digit 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in 441-450.\n\n- 8 appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nTherefore, total in the tens place:\n\n4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50.\n\n8: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 49, but now it's 48. That's a discrepancy. Let me check where I went wrong.\n\nIn my initial calculation, I considered that from 1-99, 100-399, and 400-488. But when I broke it down into 1-400 and 401-488, I saw that from 401-488, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place, so total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered from 1-99, 100-399, and 400-488, I thought that in 400-488, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place, leading to 10 + 30 + 9 = 49. But that seems incorrect because in 400-488, the tens digit 8 only appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, not 9.\n\nWait, 481-488 is 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 9. Therefore, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in 400-488, leading to a total of 40 + 8 = 48 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, earlier, I must have made a mistake in the initial breakdown by considering 9 pages instead of 8. So, the correct count for 8's in the tens place is 48, not 49.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place: 48.\n\nSo, total 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89 (from 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 48\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nWait, so now the total 8's are 97, and 4's are 188, so the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I had 98 for 8's and now it's 97. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, 8's are 48, units place is 49, so total 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but now it's 91. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recast this:\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 48\n\nTotal: 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems consistent now.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered 480-488 as 9 pages, I thought 8's in the tens place were 9, leading to 49 total 8's. But that's incorrect because 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488), but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, that's 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, meaning 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nWait, so earlier, when I thought it was 8 pages, I was wrong. It's actually 9 pages, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in 400-488.\n\nSo, let me correct that.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included in 400-488, so 480 is part of the 400-488 range.\n\nWait, but 480 is the first page with tens digit 8 in the 400-488 range, and 488 is the last. So, that's 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, 9 pages, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n- From 401-488: 10 times for 4 (441-450), and 9 times for 8 (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n8: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place: 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 49\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n\n- Tens: 50\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, so where did I go wrong earlier? I think I confused the number of pages in the last partial set. When I broke it down into 401-488, I thought that 480-488 was 9 pages, which it is, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times there, leading to 49 total 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, the correct counts are:\n\n4's: 188\n\n8's: 98\n\nDifference: 90.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- 48 full sets contribute 48 each.\n- The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n- **Total 4's in units place:** 49\n- **Total 8's in units place:** 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each set of 100 pages contributes 10 occurrences of each digit.\n- 400 pages contribute 40 each for 4 and 8.\n- Pages 401-488 add 10 occurrences of 4 (440-449) and 9 occurrences of 8 (480-488).\n- **Total 4's in tens place:** 50\n- **Total 8's in tens place:** 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n- **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by considering how numbers are formed. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. The book has 488 pages, so the page numbers go from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488). \n\nI think the key here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, the number 4 is there; in 11-20, the number 14 is there, and so on. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete blocks of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at 484. So that's one more 4. So total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many complete blocks of 100 do we have? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an incomplete block (401-488).\n\nIn each complete block, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks give 4*10 = 40. Now, in the incomplete block (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's 10 numbers, but wait, does 449 exist? Yes, because 488 is the last page. So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. In the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete blocks of 100, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the incomplete block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 more. So total tens 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 blocks * 1 + 1 (484) = 49\n- Tens: 4 blocks *10 + 10 (440-449) = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 blocks *1 +1 (488) =49\n- Tens: 4 blocks *10 +9 (480-488) =49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal:49 +49=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. With 48 complete blocks (1-480) and one additional number (484), total units 4's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each block of 100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. With 4 complete blocks (1-400) and 10 numbers (440-449) in the incomplete block, total tens 4's = 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears once per block of 10. With 48 complete blocks and 488, total units 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each block of 100, 8 appears 10 times. With 4 complete blocks and 9 numbers (480-488) in the incomplete block, total tens 8's = 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has a number that's either one digit, two digits, or three digits long. Let me think about how the digits 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, I should probably consider each digit position separately. That is, look at how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place, then in the tens place, and then in the hundreds place. Then, I can add those up for each digit and find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once (like in 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages each, and then an extra 8 pages. In each full block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place counts are 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. Wait, so in the units place, they're equal. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. For the units place, each block of 10 has exactly one 4 and one 8. So, 48 blocks give 48 each. Then, the last partial block from 481 to 488 is 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, yes, units place: 48 +1=49 for 4, and same for 8. So, units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit cycles every 100 pages. So, for each block of 100 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each set of 10 pages. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, in the first 100 pages, we have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place and 10 of 8. Similarly, in the next 100 pages (101-200), the tens digit cycles again, so another 10 each. Same for 201-300 and 301-400. So, that's four hundreds, each contributing 10 each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4, and same for 8.\n\nNow, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? Let me see. The tens digit in these pages goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, looking at 440-449: that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. But wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included in 401-488, right? So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, looking at 480-488: the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, that's 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480 is the first page, so 480, 481,...,488. That's 9 pages, but wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 pages, right? Wait, 488 - 480 +1 = 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. Wait, but 480 is the first page, so 480 is included, making it 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for 488 pages, we have 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8, so 40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (from 480-488). So, total in tens place: 4's: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +9=49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, it's four hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles again. So, 401-410: tens digit 0; 411-420: tens digit 1; 421-430: tens digit 2; 431-440: tens digit 3; 441-450: tens digit 4; 451-460: tens digit 5; 461-470: tens digit 6; 471-480: tens digit 7; 481-490: tens digit 8. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 481-488 is 8 pages, not 10. So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, but wait, 480 is included in the previous block. So, 480-488: 480 is in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nBut wait, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total in tens place: 4's: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, plus 1 more in the last 8 pages, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's, making it 50. For 8's, in the last partial hundred, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's, making it 49. So, yes, 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188, and 49+49+0=98. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that in the tens place, I didn't overcount. So, in the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more 4's. And the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more 8's. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: For the tens place, in 488 pages, how many times does each digit appear? The formula is usually (n / 100) * 10 for each digit, but adjusted for the remainder.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, the number of times a specific digit appears in the tens place is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 pages: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, so for digit 4, it occurs once every 10 pages, so in 88 pages, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's the number of times the tens digit is 4 in 401-488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, for 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nSo, yes, 40 +10=50 for 4, and 40 +9=49 for 8.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, it's (488 // 10) *1 + min(488 % 10, 4-0). Wait, no, more accurately, for each digit in the units place, it's (number of complete tens) *1 plus whether the last partial ten includes the digit.\n\nSo, 488 // 10 =48, so 48 complete tens, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8. Then, the last partial ten is 481-488, which has units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 each.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSo, adding it all up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - 488 pages have 48 full blocks of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by considering how digits are used in page numbers. Page numbers range from 1 to 488, so each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. But since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to consider all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this systematically. Maybe I can break it down by the number of digits: one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 occur once each. That means the count so far is 4:1, 8:1.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers: these are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit can be 4 or 8. If it's 4, the number ranges from 40 to 49, which is 10 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Similarly, if the tens digit is 8, the numbers are from 80 to 89, another 10 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- For each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 18, 28, etc.).\n- There are 9 groups of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), so the digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and the same for 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, there are 9 tens groups (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, in each group, the units digit 4 appears once, so 9 times in total for 4's. Similarly, 8's appear 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nWait, that can't be right because when the tens digit is 4, the units digits go from 0 to 9, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Similarly for 8. But for the units place, in each of the 9 tens groups, 4 and 8 appear once each, so 9 times each.\n\nSo, adding up, for two-digit numbers, 4's: 10 + 9 = 19, and 8's: 10 + 9 = 19. So, the count so far after two-digit numbers would be 4's: 1 + 19 = 20, and 8's: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nWait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake here. Because when I'm considering two-digit numbers, I shouldn't include the one-digit numbers again. Wait, no, actually, the one-digit numbers are separate. So, in two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, I have 90 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). In the units place, for each tens group, 4 appears once, so 9 times in total, and 8 appears once in each group, so 9 times. So, 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19, and 8's: 10 + 9 = 19. So, adding the one-digit counts, 4's: 1 (from one-digit) + 19 (from two-digit) = 20, and 8's: 1 + 19 = 20.\n\nWait, but that would mean that up to two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 have been printed 20 times each. But let's check that. For example, in two-digit numbers, the 4's in the tens place are 40-49, which is 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Then, in the units place, for each group like 10-19, 20-29, etc., the units digit 4 appears once per group, so 9 groups, 9 times. So, 10 + 9 = 19. Similarly for 8's. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but the last page is 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nI think I should break down the three-digit numbers into hundreds, tens, and units places and count the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place:\n- Hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- For each hundreds digit, the tens and units digits can range from 00 to 99, except when the hundreds digit is 4, where the maximum is 88 (since the last page is 488).\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. When the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, the tens and units digits can go from 00 to 99, giving 100 numbers each. But when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can be from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0 to 8, and units digits can be 0 to 9, except when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to separate the hundreds digit into 1, 2, 3, and 4, and handle each case separately.\n\nLet me start with hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n- Hundreds digit is 1, so 1 appears in the hundreds place 100 times, but we're interested in 4's and 8's, so let's move on.\n- For the tens place: in 100-199, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, each for 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Once per cycle, so 10 times (e.g., 140-149). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (180-189).\n- For the units place: in each tens group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the units digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per group, and there are 10 groups, so 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nSo, in 100-199:\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n- 8's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n\nNext, hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n- Similar to 100-199.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (240-249), 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n- Units place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- So, 4's: 10 + 10 = 20\n- 8's: 10 + 10 = 20\n\nHundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n- Same as above.\n- 4's: 10 (tens) + 10 (units) = 20\n- 8's: 10 + 10 = 20\n\nNow, hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\nThis is where it gets a bit tricky because the range isn't a full 100 numbers. It goes from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nLet me break this down into tens and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 400-488.\n\nTens place:\n- The tens digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Let me think of it as 400-488, which is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo, the tens digit can be from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit can only go up to 8.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 400-488:\n- Tens digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- For each tens digit except 8, the units digit goes from 0-9, giving 10 numbers per tens digit.\n- For tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8, giving 9 numbers.\n\nSo, let's count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place:\n- For 4's in the tens place: occurs when the tens digit is 4. That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n- For 8's in the tens place: occurs when the tens digit is 8. But in this case, the units digits only go up to 8, so the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8's in the tens place: 9 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in 400-488:\n- We need to consider each tens group and count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units digit.\n\nLet me go through each tens group:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409. Units digits 0-9. So, 4 appears once (404), 8 appears once (408).\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419. Units digits 0-9. 404 isn't here, but 414 is. So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once (418).\n- Similarly, for tens digits 2,3,4,5,6,7: each will have a 4 and an 8 in the units place. So, 4 appears once per group, and 8 appears once per group.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488. Units digits 0-8. So, 484 is present (units digit 4), and 488 is present (units digit 8). So, 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\nWait, but for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers, so units digits 0-9. So, for each of these, 4 and 8 appear once each in the units place. That's 8 tens groups (0-7), each contributing 1 to 4's and 1 to 8's in the units place.\n\nThen, for tens digit 8, units digits 0-8, so 484 and 488 are present, contributing 1 each.\n\nSo, total units place:\n- 4's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n- 8's: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each tens group from 0 to 7, there are 10 units digits, so 4 and 8 each appear once per group. So, 8 groups (0-7) would give 8 times each. Then, for tens group 8, units digits go up to 8, so 484 is present (units 4) and 488 is present (units 8). So, that's 1 more for each, making total 9 for both 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nSo, in the units place for 400-488:\n- 4's: 9\n- 8's: 9\n\nPutting it all together for hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- Tens place: 4's = 10, 8's = 9\n- Units place: 4's = 9, 8's = 9\n- So, total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n- Total 8's: 9 + 9 = 18\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nIn the units place, for each tens group from 0 to 7, each has 10 numbers, so 4 and 8 each appear once per group, so 8 groups \u00d71 = 8 each. Then, for tens group 8, units digits go up to 8, so 484 and 488 are present, so that's 1 each. So, total units place 4's: 8 +1=9, 8's:8 +1=9.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488: 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19\nTotal 8's: 9 (tens) +9 (units)=18\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts:\n\nOne-digit numbers:\n- 4's:1\n- 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n- 4's:19\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n- Hundreds digit 1: 4's=20, 8's=20\n- Hundreds digit 2: 4's=20, 8's=20\n- Hundreds digit 3: 4's=20, 8's=20\n- Hundreds digit 4: 4's=19, 8's=18\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's:\n1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +20 (100-199) +20 (200-299) +20 (300-399) +19 (400-488) = 1 +19=20; 20+20=40; 40+20=60; 60+20=80; 80+19=99.\n\nSimilarly, adding up all the 8's:\n1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +20 (100-199) +20 (200-299) +20 (300-399) +18 (400-488) =1 +19=20; 20+20=40; 40+20=60; 60+20=80; 80+18=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:99\nTotal 8's:98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 99, and the number of 8's is 98. So, 99 -98=1. Therefore, there is one more 4 printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds digit 1: 4's=20, 8's=20\nHundreds digit 2: 4's=20, 8's=20\nHundreds digit 3: 4's=20, 8's=20\nHundreds digit 4: 4's=19, 8's=18\n\nAdding up 4's: 20+20+20+19=79\nAdding up 8's:20+20+20+18=78\n\nThen, adding the two-digit and one-digit counts:\n\n4's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +79 (three-digit) =1+19=20+79=99\n8's:1 +19 +78=1+19=20+78=98\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 99 4's and 98 8's, so 1 more 4.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 99, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there is one more 4 printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{1}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page has a single number, and each digit in those numbers can be a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between those two counts. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are arranged in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll have to consider all three cases: units place, tens place, and hundreds place for both 4 and 8.\n\nMaybe I should handle each digit place separately. So, I'll look at the units place, tens place, and hundreds place individually for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For each complete set of ten pages, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. Therefore, for each ten pages, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n\nHow many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 extra pages. So, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 also appears 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set of 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in that partial set, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nHmm, so the difference in the units place is zero. Let me move on to the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit appears in the tens position for ten consecutive numbers. For example, in 10-19, the tens digit is 1; in 20-29, it's 2, and so on. So, for each ten numbers, the tens digit is fixed. Now, how often does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see.\n\nIn a 100-page book, the digit 4 would appear in the tens place for 10 numbers: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 would appear in the tens place for 10 numbers: 80-89. So, for each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nBut since our book is 488 pages, let's see how many hundreds we have. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages in the 401-488 range.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages beyond that. So, in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 hundreds, that would be 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4, and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, we have 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, after 400, the next set is 401-488. Let's check the tens place in this range. The tens digit in 401-488 is 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-490). But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 481-488, which is only 8 pages. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? In the 441-450 range, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, but since our book stops at 488, we need to check if 441-450 is entirely within 488. Yes, 450 is less than 488, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 441-450.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 in the tens place appears in 481-490, but our book only goes up to 488, so that's 8 numbers: 481-488. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total count for 4 is 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 from 441-450, so 50 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each hundred has 10 times for 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40 times, and then in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is another 10 times. So, total for 4 in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, each hundred has 10 times, so 4 hundreds would be 40 times. But in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so that's 8 times. So, total for 8 in the tens place is 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 400 times 10 is 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, making 50 for 4. For 8, each hundred has 10 times, so 40, and in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more, making 48 for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check again. When counting the tens place, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 40 each. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more for 4, making 50. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 more for 8, making 48. So yes, 50 vs 48, so 4's are 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all pages from 400 to 488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the units place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\nDifference: 0\n\nFor the tens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\nDifference: 2\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\nDifference: 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 91 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me recalculate the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48. So, 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 4's and 8's both appear 49 times, so no difference.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place. Let me check again.\n\nIn the units place, for each set of ten pages, both 4 and 8 appear once. So, 488 pages mean 48 complete sets of ten, which is 48 * 10 = 480 pages, and then 8 extra pages (481-488). So, in each complete set of ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, so 48 times each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, that's correct, no difference in units place.\n\nWait, but when I add up the differences, it's 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91. So, the total number of 4's is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct. So, 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, 50 times, and 8's, 48 times, so 2 more 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages (e.g., 1-10) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 each, so no difference.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 48 for 8. Difference: +2 for 4.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears here.\n   - Difference: +89 for 4.\n\n**Total Difference:** 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position for both 4 and 8 and then add them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place:** In every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers. So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 fours. But wait, the last block is from 481 to 488, so the units place goes up to 8. So, in this last partial block, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each such block contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\n- First block: 40-49: 10 fours\n- Second block: 140-149: 10 fours\n- Third block: 240-249: 10 fours\n- Fourth block: 340-349: 10 fours\n- Fifth block: 440-449: 10 fours\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included. Since 449 is less than 488, yes, it's fully included. So 5 blocks, 10 each, 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that?\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89.\n\nSo total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So how many full blocks are there up to 488?\n\nSame as before: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. The last partial block is 481-488, which has units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens place. 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks contributes 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights\n- 180-189: 10 eights\n- 280-289: 10 eights\n- 380-389: 10 eights\n\nWait, 480-489 would be the next block, but since our book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 appears only 9 times (since 488 is the last page). So does that affect our count?\n\nWait, no, because in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in the tens place for that block. But wait, I'm counting the number of times 8 appears in the tens place, not the number of pages. So each block where the tens digit is 8 contributes 10 eights, but in the last block, 480-488, it's only 9 eights because the page ends at 488.\n\nWait, but actually, 480-489 would be a full block if we had 489 pages, but since we have 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for that block.\n\nSo let me recount:\n\n- 80-89: 10 eights\n- 180-189: 10 eights\n- 280-289: 10 eights\n- 380-389: 10 eights\n- 480-488: 9 eights\n\nSo total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct because the last block only has 9 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place doesn't have any 8's.\n\nSo total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. I think I might have made a mistake there. Let's see: the blocks where the tens digit is 8 are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did the 4's, the hundreds place was from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. Then, in 481-488, 4 appears once more (at 484), so 49 fours. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the 4's tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, totaling 49. So that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488) where 4 appears once more. Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are five such blocks, each contributing 10 fours. Total tens place 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full blocks and one partial block where 8 appears once more. Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four full blocks and a partial block (480-488) contributing 9 eights. Total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in the 800s, so no 8's here.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by considering how many digits each page number has. Page numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, from 10 to 99 are two-digit, from 100 to 488 are three-digit. So, maybe I can handle each of these ranges separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nFirst, let me think about the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the page numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, how many times does the digit 4 appear here? Well, only once, which is at page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once at page 8. So, in single-digit pages, the count for 4's is 1 and for 8's is also 1. So, the difference here is 0.\n\nNext, I should consider the two-digit page numbers, which go from 10 to 99. Now, in two-digit numbers, there's a tens place and a units place. I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: The tens digit can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. For each tens digit, there are 10 possible units digits (0 through 9). So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40 to 49, which is 10 numbers. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, so numbers 80 to 89.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: For each tens digit (1 through 9), the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each tens digit, the units digit 4 appears once, and the same for 8. Since there are 9 tens digits (1-9), each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, that's 9 times for 4 and 9 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nSo, adding up for two-digit numbers: For 4's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. For 8's, it's 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times. So, the difference here is also 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which go from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I need to count the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book has 488 pages. So, when the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, the numbers go from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488 respectively.\n\nFirst, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Only when the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0 through 9, and for each hundreds digit, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. But since the book ends at 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit only goes up to 8, not 9. So, I need to be careful here.\n\nLet's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The tens digit can be 0-9, so for each tens digit, there are 10 units digits. So, for each hundreds digit 1, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Once every 10 numbers, so 10 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Same logic applies. Tens digits 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Again, tens digits 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits here are 0-8, which is 9 possibilities. For each tens digit, the units digit cycles 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit only goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, when the hundreds digit is 4 and the tens digit is 8, the units digits go from 0 to 8, making 9 numbers (480-488). But for the other tens digits (0-7), each has 10 units digits (0-9). So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits, so 8 tens digits, each contributing 10 numbers. So, for each of these, the tens digit is fixed, and the units digit cycles. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? When the tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times (440-449). Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place when the tens digit is 8, but wait, in hundreds digit 4, the tens digits only go up to 8, but 8 is included.\n\nWait, no, the tens digit for hundreds digit 4 is from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, that's 10 numbers (440-449), so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. When the tens digit is 8, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but when the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, making it 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. So, in the hundreds digit 4, the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds digits \u00d7 10 each = 30 for 4 and 30 for 8.\n- Hundreds digit 4: 10 times for 4 and 9 times for 8.\n\nSo, total in tens place for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, because for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 for both 4 and 8. Then, for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So, total for 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40, and for 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, we'll consider each hundreds digit separately.\n\n1. Hundreds digit 1: 100-199. For each tens digit (0-9), the units digit cycles 0-9. So, for each tens digit, the units digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. There are 10 tens digits, so 10 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n2. Hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Same logic: 10 tens digits, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 10 each.\n\n3. Hundreds digit 3: 300-399. Again, 10 each.\n\n4. Hundreds digit 4: 400-488. Here, the tens digit goes up to 8, so let's see:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: Each has 10 units digits (0-9), so each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. There are 8 tens digits (0-7), so 8 \u00d7 1 = 8 for 4 and 8 for 8.\n\n- For tens digit 8: Units digits go from 0-8, so units digits 0-8. So, the units digit 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 each.\n\nSo, total for units place in hundreds digit 4:\n\n- 4's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n- 8's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9\n\nWait, but wait, when the tens digit is 8, units digits go up to 8, so units digits 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear? Only once at 484. Similarly, 8 appears once at 488. So, yes, 1 each.\n\nSo, total units place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds digits 1,2,3: Each contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 each.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 9 for 4 and 9 for 8.\n\nSo, total units place:\n\n- 4's: 30 + 9 = 39\n- 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for three-digit numbers.\n\nIn hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nIn tens place:\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nIn units place:\n- 4's: 39\n- 8's: 39\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nWait, let me check that again. For 4's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 39\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, let me add that up again.\n\nFor 4's:\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n20 + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) = 20\n20 + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place: 10 each for 4 and 8\n- Units place: 9 each for 4 and 8\nTotal: 10 + 9 = 19 each\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40, 8 appears 39\n- Units place: 4 appears 39, 8 appears 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - **4's:** Appears once (page 4).\n   - **8's:** Appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49).\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For each tens digit (1-9), 4 and 8 each appear once per ten numbers.\n     - Total: 9 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - **Total for Two-Digit Pages:**\n     - 4's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - 8's: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n     - For hundreds digit 4: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n     - **Total:**\n       - 4's: 3\u00d710 + 10 = 40.\n       - 8's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: Each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8.\n     - For hundreds digit 4: Each tens digit (0-7) contributes 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, and tens digit 8 contributes 1 each.\n     - **Total:**\n       - 4's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39.\n       - 8's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Total for Three-Digit Pages:**\n     - 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that page numbers can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers depending on the total number of pages. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I'll need to consider how the digits 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by thinking about how often each digit appears in each position. For the units place, every 10 pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, in the units place, the digit 4 appears once every 10 pages, and the same goes for 8. Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, in the tens place, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times every 100 pages. \n\nWait, but I need to be careful because the book doesn't necessarily end at a multiple of 10 or 100. So, I should calculate how many times each digit appears in each position up to 488.\n\nLet me structure this by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 repeats every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and an additional 8 numbers. \n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Looking at the remaining 8 numbers after 480, which are 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 through 8. So, there's a 4 in 484, but 484 is within the 480-488 range. Wait, 484 is 480 + 4, so yes, that's another 4 in the units place. So, units place 4's total to 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, each set of 10 has one 8. So, 48 sets give 48, and in the remaining 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, 8's in units place total to 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, that's interesting. So, the difference in the units place is zero. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, 488 is the last page, so from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and then 481-488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each 10, so 48 times plus once in 484, making 49. Similarly, 8 appears once in each 10, so 48 times plus once in 488, making 49. So yes, units place gives 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly for 8 in 80-89.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 times 10 for each digit, so 40 times each.\n\nNow, we need to check the remaining 88 pages, from 401 to 488. Let's break this down further.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 401-410) up to 8 (in 480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n\nFirst, the tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0. In 411-420, it's 1, and so on, up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8.\n\nNow, how many times does the tens digit equal 4 in 401-488? That would be in 440-449. So, from 440 to 449, the tens digit is 4. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does the tens digit equal 8 in 401-488? That's in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the start, and 488 is the end, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, but actually, 480 is included, so from 480 to 489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480-488.\n\nWait, but 480 is included, so 480 is the first number with tens digit 8 in this range. So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, meaning 9 times.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding that to the 40 times from the complete hundreds, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, from 1-400, each digit 4 and 8 in the tens place appears 4 times 10, which is 40 each. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, 100-199 have 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can only be 0,1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count here is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit in each position.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98, right. So, total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8. In the tens place, 4 had 50 and 8 had 49. In the hundreds place, 4 had 89 and 8 had 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each position again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, with an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, 4 appears once in 484, and 8 appears once in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 seems a bit high. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another way to approach this might be to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write a small table to track each digit's occurrence.\n\nBut maybe I should check my counts again.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48, and if the last digit is >=4, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's: floor(488/10) = 48, and if the last digit >=8, add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is equal, so 48 +1 = 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: for each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nThe tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: each hundred has 10 times, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 480-488 has tens digit 8, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed.\n\nWait, but that's maybe overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me see: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as I thought, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Units Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets, with 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4's in units place: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's in units place: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place**:\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - In 400 pages: 400 / 100 = 4 sets, so 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place**:\n   - Pages 1-399: Hundreds digit is 0,1,2,3; no 4's or 8's.\n   - Pages 400-488: Hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8's: 0 times.\n\n4. **Total Counts**:\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference**:\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI know that page numbers go from 1 to 488. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. So, maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because the number of times a digit appears in each place can be calculated individually.\n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. \n\nBut wait, the book has 488 pages, which isn't a multiple of ten. So, I'll need to calculate how many complete sets of ten there are and then account for the remaining pages. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each of those 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the units place. Now, I need to check the remaining 8 numbers: 481 to 488. Let me list their units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they're equal. That's interesting. So, no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nBut again, since the book has 488 pages, I need to consider how many complete hundreds there are and the remaining part. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of those 4 hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times. Now, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times, but wait, 88 is 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420,...,481-490) but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. \n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but we stop at 488, which is 481-488. So, the tens digits in 401-488 are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except for 8, which appears only 8 times because we stop at 488. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but we only go up to 488, so the tens digit 8 appears from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here. \n\nBut wait, actually, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, appearing only 8 times. So, for the tens digit 4 in this range, it appears 10 times (440-449), right? Because 440-449 is within 401-488. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (481-488). \n\nWait, but let me check. The range 401-488 includes 401 to 488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, the tens digit 0 occurs from 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 from 411-420 (10), 2 from 421-430 (10), 3 from 431-440 (10), 4 from 441-450 (10), 5 from 451-460 (10), 6 from 461-470 (10), 7 from 471-480 (10), and 8 from 481-488 (8 numbers). \n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450). Digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nSo, total for the tens place: digit 4 appears 4*10 (from the complete hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50 times. Digit 8 appears 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from 401-488) = 48 times. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48. That's a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Since the book has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nLet me see: from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's are 89 and 8's are 0. That's a difference of 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48 \u2192 difference +2\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91\n\nSo, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488): 4's appear 10 times (440-449), 8's appear 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 4\u00d710 + 8 = 48.\n   - Difference: +2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4's appear from 400-488: 89 times.\n   - 8's do not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: +89.\n\n**Total Difference:** 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should start by understanding how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers from 1 to 488 and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how digits appear in numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a three-digit number. So, I should consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. I'll consider each place (units, tens, hundreds) one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, how many such groups are there up to 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, giving 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (pages 481-488), how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, 484 is the only one, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nWell, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The next block would be 140-149, another 10, and so on. Let me figure out how many hundreds are there. Since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for pages 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in each hundred block once. \n\nIn the first hundred (1-99), the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. In the second hundred (100-199), it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10, and in 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's another 10. \n\nSo, each hundred block contributes 10 times, and there are 5 hundred blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but the last block isn't a full hundred; it's only up to 488. But in the tens place, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 10 (for each hundred) times 5 hundreds, which is 50. Wait, but let me check: 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. That's 5 times 10, which is 50. So, 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's how many numbers? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the places for 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8. I'll do the same analysis for 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full groups of 10 are there up to 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in the units place, 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 +1=49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488.\n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 once, contributing 10 numbers. So, for 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. For 100-199: 180-189, another 10. 200-299:280-289, another 10. 300-399:380-389, another 10. 400-488:480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the last block, it's only 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo, for the tens place: 0-99:10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, total tens place 8's are 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8 in any page number. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all places for 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me recount the tens place for 8. In each hundred, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 per hundred. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99,100-199,200-299,300-399), each contributing 10, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's are 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check units place for 4. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial cycle, 481-488, 484 is the only one with a units digit 4. So, 48 +1=49, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place of 8: same logic, 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, and then 488 adds one more, so 49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any. Another way to check is to think about how many numbers have 4 in each place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place up to N is floor(N/10)*1 + extra, where extra is 1 if the last digit is >=d.\n\nWait, more accurately, for units digit, the count is (N // 10) * 1 + min(1, N % 10 >= d ? 1 : 0).\n\nWait, perhaps more precise: For digit d in units place, the count is (N // 10) + 1 if the last digit is >=d, else (N // 10).\n\nWait, let me test with N=488.\n\nFor digit 4 in units place: 488 //10=48. Since 488%10=8 >=4, so total is 48 +1=49, which matches.\n\nFor digit 8 in units place: 488//10=48. 488%10=8 >=8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place, digit d: the count is (N // 100)*10 + something.\n\nWait, the formula for tens place is a bit more involved. For each hundred block, digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, up to N, the count is (N // 100)*10 + extra, where extra is the number of times d appears in the tens place in the remaining part.\n\nFor example, N=488.\n\nFor digit 4 in tens place: 488//100=4. So, 4*10=40. Then, the remaining is 88. The tens digit in 88 is 8, which is higher than 4, so we check how many numbers from 400 to 488 have tens digit 4. That's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 449 is less than 488, so 10. So total is 4*10 +10=50.\n\nWait, but in my earlier count, I had 5 blocks each contributing 10, which was 50. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in tens place: 488//100=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining is 88. The tens digit in 88 is 8, so we check how many numbers from 400-488 have tens digit 8. That's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, total is 4*10 +9=49, which matches.\n\nFor hundreds place, digit d: count is (N >= d*100) ? (N - d*100 +1) : 0.\n\nFor digit 4: N=488 >=400, so count is 488 -400 +1=89.\n\nFor digit 8: N=488 <800, so count is 0.\n\nSo, yes, the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately. Similarly, the same is done for the digit 8. \n\nFor the digit 4:\n- **Units place**: 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place**: 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place**: 89 occurrences.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- **Units place**: 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place**: 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place**: 0 occurrences.\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI think the first step is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete blocks of 10 in the total page numbers, plus any extra in the incomplete block if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nSimilarly for 8.\n\nSo, let's calculate for the units place:\n\nTotal pages = 488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480). Each block contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, the remaining pages after 480 are 481 to 488. Let's look at the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So in the units place, there's one more 4 (at 484) and one more 8 (at 488).\n\nSo total units place fours: 48 +1 =49.\n\nTotal units place eights: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, that's interesting, same number of 4's and 8's in units place.\n\nNow moving on to the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see.\n\nTotal pages =488.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (since 4*100=400). Each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nNow, the remaining pages after 400 are 401 to 488.\n\nIn the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490. But wait, the last page is 488, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nLooking at 401-488: The tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, 2 in 421-430, 3 in 431-440, 4 in 441-450, 5 in 451-460, 6 in 461-470, 7 in 471-480, and 8 in 481-488.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, 441-450 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 fours.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the tens place in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers: 481-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, right? So in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, I think we might have to consider that as well, but let me finish the tens place first.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\nTotal fours: 40 (from the four hundreds) +10 (from 441-450) =50.\n\nTotal eights: 40 (from four hundreds) +8 (from 481-488) =48.\n\nWait, but wait, no. Wait, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 times, so adding to the 40 from the four hundreds, total fours in tens place:50.\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so eights in tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nWait, but actually, in the initial four hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 times, so total eights in tens place:40+8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds digit is only non-zero from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 have hundreds digit 0, 100-199 have 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 page numbers.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFirst, let's total the fours:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, total eights:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights:49+48+0=97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal pages=488.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10:48 (since 48*10=480). Each block contributes one 4 and one 8 in units place. So 48 fours and 48 eights.\n\nRemaining pages:481-488. Units digits:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So one more 4 and one more 8.\n\nTotal units fours:48+1=49.\n\nTotal units eights:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 100:4 (1-400). Each block contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in tens place. So 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights.\n\nRemaining pages:401-488.\n\nIn tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 fours.\n\n8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 eights.\n\nTotal tens fours:40+10=50.\n\nTotal tens eights:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488:89 pages.\n\n8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nTotal hundreds fours:89.\n\nTotal hundreds eights:0.\n\nSo total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a way to cross-verify this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the total number of digits and see if the counts make sense, but that might be more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, another way: for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 488/10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the remaining 8 pages contributing one 4 and one 8. So units place:49 fours, 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n488/100=4.88, so 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. So 40 fours, 40 eights.\n\nThe remaining 88 pages (401-488) in the tens place: the tens digit cycles every 10. So in 88 pages, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So for each ten's digit, it's 10 pages, except possibly the last one.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It's when the tens digit is 4, which is 441-450, which is 10 pages. So 10 fours.\n\nHow about 8? It's when the tens digit is 8, which is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So 8 eights.\n\nSo total tens fours:40+10=50.\n\nTotal tens eights:40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 488-400+1=89 pages. So 89 fours.\n\nSo hundreds place:89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo total fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 complete blocks, contributing 48 fours and 48 eights.\n   - Remaining pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - 488 pages mean 4 complete blocks, contributing 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - Remaining pages 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (441-450), 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 48 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 97 eights = 91 more fours.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that page numbers go from 1 to 488, each printed once. So, each page number is a number between 1 and 488. Now, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are distributed in numbers. Each digit can appear in the units place, tens place, hundreds place, etc., depending on the number of digits in the page numbers. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I'll need to consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, let me figure out how many digits there are in total, but actually, I don't think I need the total digits, just the count of 4's and 8's. So, I should probably handle each digit position separately.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.) and similarly, 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). So, for the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? \n\nBut wait, let me check. The book has 488 pages, so the units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So, the number of complete cycles in 488 pages is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a cycle, there are 48 complete cycles and then 8 extra pages (480 to 488). \n\nIn each complete cycle (10 pages), there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 cycles, that's 48 times 1, so 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, in these extra pages, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the units place has 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, for the units place, they're equal.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in each block of 100 pages, the digit in the tens place goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in each 100-page block (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNow, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages each, so 4 * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place. Similarly, for 8's, it's 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining 88 pages: 401-488. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, let's see where 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, but wait, in the remaining 88 pages, does 441-450 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 441 is within that range. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the remaining pages.\n\nWait, but hold on, when considering the tens digit in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in 441-450. For the digit 8 in the tens place, it appears 8 times in 481-488.\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 contributes 10 more 4's, and the tens digit 8 contributes 8 more 8's.\n\nAdding this to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete blocks) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, so far, in the tens place, we have 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, 400-488 is the hundreds digit 4, but let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nFrom 300-399, that's 100 pages where the hundreds digit is 3, so 4 doesn't appear there. Wait, no, 300-399 has hundreds digit 3, so 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place there. Then, from 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nWhat about the hundreds digit for 8? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 8 if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, we have 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits for 4's and 8's.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 pages. Each 10 pages, one 4 and one 8 in units place. 48 full cycles (48*10=480 pages), so 48 each. Then, 8 extra pages: 481-488. Units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's:48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages, 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. 4 complete blocks (400 pages), so 4*10=40 each. Remaining 88 pages: 401-488.\n\nIn 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, 10 more 4's. For 8 in the tens place, it's in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 8 more 8's.\n\nThus, tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 pages where hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 4's. 8's: 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188\n\n8's:49 +48 +0 =97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete cycles (480 pages) give 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute 10 4's and 10 8's.\n   - 4 complete blocks (400 pages) give 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 more 4's (441-450) and 8 more 8's (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 50, 8's: 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nAlright, the pages go from 1 to 488. Each page number is printed once, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer.\n\nLet me start by considering how digits are arranged in page numbers. Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to three digits. So, I should probably analyze the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, let me handle the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit, like 4 or 8, appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so I need to adjust for that. Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 full sets of 10 pages, and then an additional 8 pages. In each full set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the count for both 4 and 8 would be 48 times. But then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, does the digit 4 appear once in the units place here? Yes, at 484. And the digit 8 appears once at 488. So, for the units place, the total count for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8, it's 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Hmm, maybe I should check that again.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades (0-9, 10-19, ..., 480-489). But since the book ends at 488, the last partial decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, each digit from 1 to 8 appears once in this partial decade. Therefore, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times (from the full decades) plus 1, totaling 49. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times plus 1, so 49 as well. So, in the units place, both digits 4 and 8 appear 49 times. Hmm, that seems correct so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 10 times for each digit. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly for 8.\n\nBut again, since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. Let me check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and 8 in 80-89, also 10 times. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149 (10 times) and 8 in 180-189 (10 times). The same applies to 200-299: 240-249 (10 times) and 280-289 (10 times). Then, 300-399: 340-349 (10 times) and 380-389 (10 times). So, up to 399, each digit 4 and 8 has appeared 40 times in the tens place (4 times 10).\n\nNow, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles again. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It would be from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (from 400-488) and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, adding to the previous counts, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 (from 0-399) + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nThe digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4 and 8, which seems correct because each full decade contributes 48, and the partial decade contributes 1 each, making 49 each.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 for 4 and 49 for 8. That makes sense because in the 400-488 range, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), while 8 appears only 9 times (480-488). So, 4's tens count is 50, 8's is 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 for 4's.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSubtracting, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that adds up correctly.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484 and 8 appears once at 488. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the 400-488 range. From 400 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. When the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's compute the total number of 4's and 8's using another approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit place, count the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- Total full sets: floor(488 / 10) = 48, so 48 times each.\n- Remaining pages: 488 - (48*10) = 8 pages (481-488).\n- In these, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n- For each 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (0-399) and then 400-488.\n- In each full hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for each.\n- Now, in 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449: 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488: 9 times.\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n- From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4 or 8.\n- From 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4 or 8.\n- From 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4 or 8.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place here, so 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total full decades: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 (484) and one more 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Full hundreds (0-399): 4 sets, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8.\n   - Total from 0-399: 40 times each.\n   - Pages 400-488:\n     - 4 appears in tens place 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears in tens place 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
