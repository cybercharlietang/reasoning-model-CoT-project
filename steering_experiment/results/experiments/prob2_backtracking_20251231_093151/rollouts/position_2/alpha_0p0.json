    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers. I guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, after 480, we have 481 to 488, which is another 8 numbers. In these, the units digit 4 appears once in 484. So that's an additional 1, making the total units place 4's equal to 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers. Specifically, from 40 to 49 in each hundred, that's 10 times. So how many hundreds are there up to 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each of these hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, in the 400s, the tens digit goes from 40 to 49, but our book ends at 488. So from 400 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and then in 450-488, the tens digit 4 doesn't appear again. Wait, no, 440-449 is 10 numbers, and then 450-488 is 40 numbers, but the tens digit doesn't hit 4 again until 490, which is beyond 488. So actually, in the 400s, the tens digit 4 only appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So that's 10 fours in the tens place for the 400s. But wait, I had earlier thought of 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. But since the 400s only contribute 10 fours in the tens place, does that mean the total tens place fours are 40? Wait, no, because the first three hundreds (1-300) each have a 40-49 block, contributing 10 each, so 3*10=30, and then the 400s have another 10, so total 40. But wait, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 fours, so yes, that's correct. So total tens place fours are 40.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nSo total number of fours is units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. So 178 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to fours, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once in 488. So total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for every block of 100 numbers, specifically in 80-89 of each hundred. So for each hundred, that's 10 eights. How many full hundreds do we have? Up to 400, that's four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit 8 is present in all of these, right? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights are 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds place eights. So hundreds place eights are 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier, for fours, I had 178, and for eights, 98. So the difference would be 178 - 98 = 80. So there are 80 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. So from 1-400, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but when I count from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 9 eights in the tens place. So yes, 49 total.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For every 10 numbers, once, so 48 full groups (1-480) gives 48 eights. Then 481-488 is 8 numbers, and 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 1 more, making it 49. That's correct.\n\nSo total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nFours: 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\nSo difference is 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours there. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for fours. From 1-400, in each hundred, 40-49 contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So that's 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place? Wait, no, because in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. So total tens place fours are 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake earlier? Earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm thinking it's 50. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, from 1-100: 40-49 is 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 101-200: 140-149 is another 10.\n\n201-300: 240-249 is another 10.\n\n301-400: 340-349 is another 10.\n\nSo that's 4*10=40 fours in the tens place from 1-400.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 fours.\n\nSo total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 40, but now I'm seeing it's 50. That changes things. So that would make the total fours as units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 178. So I must have made a mistake in the tens place count.\n\nWait, let me recount the tens place for fours.\n\nFrom 1-100: 40-49: 10 fours.\n\n101-200: 140-149: 10.\n\n201-300: 240-249: 10.\n\n301-400: 340-349: 10.\n\nSo that's 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488: 440-449: 10.\n\nSo total tens place fours: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial count. So I must have made a mistake earlier. So the correct total fours would be 188.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the eights again.\n\nUnits place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0.\n\nTotal eights:98.\n\nSo difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier it was 80. So now I'm confused.\n\nWait, let me make sure.\n\nWait, so in the tens place for fours, I had initially thought 40, but upon recounting, it's 50. So that adds 10 more fours, making the total fours 188 instead of 178.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10, so 50 total.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89.\n\n49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nEights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0.\n\nTotal eights:98.\n\nDifference:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but now I'm getting 90. Earlier, I thought 80.\n\nHmm, where did I go wrong? Let me check the units place again.\n\nUnits place for fours: from 1-488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, one 4. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48.\n\nThen, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's 1 more.\n\nTotal units place fours:48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in units place: same logic, 48 full groups, 48 eights, plus 488, which is 1 more, so 49.\n\nOkay, that's correct.\n\nTens place for fours:50.\n\nTens place for eights:49.\n\nHundreds place for fours:89.\n\nHundreds place for eights:0.\n\nSo total fours:49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal eights:49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo from 1-400, it's 4*10=40.\n\nFrom 401-488, it's 10.\n\nSo total tens place fours:50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in my initial solution, I thought it was 40, but now I see it's 50. So that changes the total fours to 188.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I'm getting conflicting results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this problem by considering each digit place separately and systematically.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nNumbers where the units digit is 4: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nHow many such numbers are there?\n\nThe first is 4, and the last is 484.\n\nThe sequence is 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nThis is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10.\n\nThe number of terms is given by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo 49 fours in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nNumbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nThese can be broken down into:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers.\n\n- 140-149: 10 numbers.\n\n- 240-249:10 numbers.\n\n- 340-349:10 numbers.\n\n- 440-449:10 numbers.\n\nWait, but our book ends at 488, so 440-449 is within the range, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo total tens place fours: 5 blocks of 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but wait, from 1-400, we have four blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349), each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 4: 400-488.\n\nHow many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1=89.\n\nSo 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal fours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n1. Units place:\n\nNumbers where the units digit is 8:8,18,28,...,488.\n\nHow many?\n\nFirst term 8, last term 488.\n\nNumber of terms: ((488 -8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49.\n\nSo 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nNumbers where the tens digit is 8.\n\nThese are:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers.\n\n- 180-189:10 numbers.\n\n- 280-289:10 numbers.\n\n- 380-389:10 numbers.\n\n- 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nWait, so from 1-400, we have four blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights.\n\nTotal tens place eights:40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nNumbers where the hundreds digit is 8:800-899, but our book ends at 488, so there are no hundreds place eights.\n\nTotal eights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98.\n\nThe difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 80. So I must have made a mistake in my initial count of the tens place for fours. It's actually 50, not 40, which changes the total.\n\nSo the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place for fours.\n\nWait, from 1-400, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349, which is 4 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 40.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10 fours, so total 50.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because initially I thought it was 80, but upon recounting, it's 90.\n\nLet me confirm once more.\n\nTotal fours:188.\n\nTotal eights:98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1 to 480).\n   - Remaining numbers (481-488): 1 occurrence (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 40-49 contributes 10 fours.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1 to 480).\n   - Remaining numbers (481-488): 1 occurrence (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In each hundred, 80-89 contributes 10 eights.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No pages in 800-899, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right?\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Then I'll do the same for the digit 8 and compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So in every block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, it's 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, after page 480, we have pages 481 to 488. So in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So the digit 4 appears once more at page 484. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 00-09, the tens digit is 0; 10-19, it's 1; and so on. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each of these blocks contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds. Each contributes 10 4's, so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the remaining pages after 400, which is 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, but in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for pages 400-409, but actually, 400 is part of the 400-499 block. Wait, perhaps I should think differently. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought 4 complete hundreds, which would be 4 blocks. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check: 1-100: 40-49 is one block. 101-200: 140-149 is another. 201-300: 240-249. 301-400: 340-349. Then 401-500: 440-449. But since the book ends at 488, 440-449 is included, but 450-488 doesn't include another full block. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Wait, but 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but the book stops at 488, so 440-449 is included, but 450-488 doesn't add another 4 in the tens place beyond 449. So yes, 5 blocks, so 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So how many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 48 full decades (each contributing 1) plus 1 more in 484, so 49. Tens: 5 blocks of 10, so 50. Hundreds: 89. So total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages. So how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more at page 488. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 pages (480 to 488). So how many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89 is one block, 180-189 another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 pages. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, contributes 9 pages where the tens digit is 8, so 9 more 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So 0.\n\nAdding these up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 4's, plus 484, so 49. That seems right.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 8's, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks are full, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. The last block, 480-488, is 9 pages, so 9 more. Total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for 4 would be 89, but let me confirm. Pages 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 pages because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place of 8, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 8's there.\n\nSo the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's 4; from 11-20, it's 14; and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete sets of ten there are in 488 and then see how many 4's are in the units place.\n\nWait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 numbers. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But then in the last partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with a 4. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. When I divide 488 by 10, I get 48 full decades and 8 extra numbers. So, in each full decade, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each digit appears once. So, 48 full decades would give 48 * 1 = 48 fours in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so only 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's 1 more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nOkay, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and then 88 more numbers.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (from 400 to 488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, how many times does the tens digit equal 4 in this range? It would be from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, because 400 to 488 is the fifth hundred, but actually, 400 to 488 is part of the 400s. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 more. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but the hundreds digit is 4 only for the numbers 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 fours in units place. Wait, no, for 8's, it's the same calculation. So, 48 full decades give 48 eights in the units place. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 1 more. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nMoving to the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers in each hundred: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8. That's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, because 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place 8's are 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits equal to 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 49, hundreds: 0, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but when I calculated units place for 8's, I thought in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once in 488, so that's correct. And in the tens place, from 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, total 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 fours. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in units, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 eights. Then, 481-488: 488 has an 8 in units, so 1 more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40 eights. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49+49=98 eights.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's correct, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, from 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408,418,...,488. Wait, how many times does 8 appear in the units place in 400-488?\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, there's one 8. There are 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so it's actually 9 tens? No, wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (each 10 numbers) and 9 extra numbers.\n\nWait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419,...,470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nIn each of the 8 full decades, the units digit 8 appears once, so that's 8 eights. Then, in 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's 1 more. So, total units place 8's in 400-488 is 8 +1=9. But wait, earlier I thought it was 9, but in the overall units place, I had 48 +1=49. Wait, maybe I'm confusing.\n\nWait, no, the units place for 8's: from 1-488, every ten numbers has one 8 in the units place, so 48 full decades give 48 eights, and then in 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is the only one with an 8 in units place, so that's 1 more, making total 49.\n\nBut when I broke it down into 400-488, I thought of 8 eights in units place from 400-480, and then 1 more in 488, totaling 9. But that's only within 400-488. So, overall, 49 is correct.\n\nI think my initial calculation was correct, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to make an off-by-one error.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each position separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last digit is >=4, then add 1. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, plus if last digit >=8, which it is (8), so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, check the last two digits: 488 mod 100=88. If the tens digit is >=4, then add (88 - 40 +1)=49? Wait, no, that's not the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many full groups of 100 there are, each contributing 10 occurrences, and then check the remaining part.\n\nSo, for the tens digit being 4:\n\nNumber of full hundreds: floor(488/100)=4. Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, the remaining part is 488 - 400 = 88. So, in the range 400-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more, making total 50.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit being 8:\n\nNumber of full hundreds: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nRemaining part: 488 - 400=88. In 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, 9 more, making total 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 9 eights in the tens place, so 40+9=49, which matches.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nNumber of 8's: from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll go through each position one by one for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers. So in 1 to 10, it's at 4; 11-20 at 14; and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, I can figure out how many full groups of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial group at the end.\n\n   The total number of units place 4's would be the number of complete decades (groups of 10) multiplied by 1 (since each decade has one 4 in the units place). Then, check if the last partial decade has a 4.\n\n   So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 full decades and then 8 more numbers (481 to 488). In each full decade, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the last partial decade, 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\n   To find how many such ranges exist in 488 pages, we can divide 488 by 100, which gives 4 full hundreds and 88 remaining pages. Each full hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So 4 times 10 is 40.\n\n   Now, check the remaining 88 pages (from 400 to 488). The tens digit here is 4 for numbers 400-409, 410-419, etc. Wait, actually, 400-409 is the first set, then 410-419 is next, but wait, 400-409 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 0 in 400, 1 in 410, etc. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up something. Let me correct that.\n\n   The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, right? Because 400-409 has tens digit 0, 410-419 has tens digit 1, 420-429 has 2, 430-439 has 3, and 440-449 has 4. So in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's another 10 occurrences. So total tens place 4's: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from the partial hundred) = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit can't be 4 for 89 numbers. Wait, 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So 89 in the hundreds place, 50 in the tens, and 49 in the units, totaling 188 4's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach hundred has a set where the tens digit is 4, which is 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have a 4 in the units place. So 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, adding 1 more. So 49 in units place.\n\nAnd hundreds place is 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers. So similar to 4, but let's check.\n\n   From 1 to 488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds 1 more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480 to 488). So each full hundred contributes 10, and the last partial hundred contributes 9.\n\n   How many full hundreds are there? From 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So in each of the first four hundreds (1-399), the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10. So that's 4 sets, each with 10, so 4*10=40.\n\n   Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). So that's 9 more. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) gives 48 4's, and 484 in 481-488 gives 1, total 49.\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) gives 48 8's, and 488 in 481-488 gives 1, total 49.\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so 4 sets with 10 each (4*10=40) and 1 set with 9, so 40 +9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place for 4's, I included 440-449 as part of the 400-488 range. But does that affect the count? Let me check: 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct. So 5 sets of 10, each contributing to the tens place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place in 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 occurrences, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 5 sets (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contribute 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers (400-488), so 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades contribute 48, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full sets (80-89, etc.) contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since pages don't reach 800.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that when counting digits, it's helpful to separate the numbers into units, tens, and hundreds places. So, maybe I should analyze each digit place separately for both the 4's and the 8's. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and so does the digit 8. For example, in 1-10, 4 is in 4 and 8 is in 8. Similarly, in 11-20, 4 is in 14 and 8 is in 18, and so on. So, for the units place, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages and then see how many 4's and 8's are there.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10. The last block will be 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, maybe I should calculate the number of complete blocks first and then handle the remaining numbers.\n\nLet me calculate the number of complete blocks of 10 in 488. That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers, which are 481-488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to the previous count, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, no, that can't be right because 48 blocks give 48, and the last 8 numbers add one more each, so 48 + 1 = 49 for both. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The first 480 pages have 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, in the units place, the counts are equal.\n\nOkay, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times. So, in each block of 100, the tens digit contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, that's 4 full hundreds and 88 pages. So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place.\n\nNow, let's look at the partial block from 401-488. The tens digit here cycles from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, let's break this down. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 from 481-488.\n\nWait, but actually, 401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420: tens digit 1\n...\n481-490: tens digit 8, but we only go up to 488, which is part of this block.\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, our range is up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It's in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our upper limit is 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's and 9 8's.\n\nTherefore, adding to the previous 40 each, the total for the tens place would be:\n\n4's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\n8's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me check again. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, four hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, yes, 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 1,2,3,4. It never reaches 8 because the book only has 488 pages, so the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, the hundreds place does not contain any 8's. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n4's: 89\n8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so we subtract 98 from 188.\n\n188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 488 pages, so 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in units place: 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 4's, 48 + 1 = 49 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Four hundreds: 40 each.\n- In 401-488, tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's, 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to check is to think about how often each digit appears in each place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nIn the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is calculated as follows:\n\nFor each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), we can calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nBut perhaps I can use the method where for each digit place, we calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me go through it again.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- For each hundred, 10 times each digit from 0-9 appears. So, for 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds and 88 pages into the fifth hundred.\n\nSo, in the first four hundreds (1-400), the tens digit cycles 0-9 four times, so each digit appears 4*10 = 40 times. So, 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit 0\n411-420: 1\n421-430: 2\n431-440: 3\n441-450: 4\n451-460: 5\n461-470: 6\n471-480: 7\n481-490: 8, but we only go up to 488.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, as we calculated, 49 each.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 4's.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is 90.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (480 pages), contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' (484) and one '8' (488).\n   - **Total Units Place:** 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total Tens Place:** 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:** 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 '4's - 98 '8's = 90 more '4's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " They can be one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit numbers, right? So, pages 1 to 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit. I guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let me first look at the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 pages, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, pages 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 pages. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial block (pages 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive pages, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). In each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on. Wait, actually, the tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 to 8. So, in this partial hundred, the tens digit 4 appears in pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, adding that to the previous total, we get 40 + 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4, in each block of 10 pages, 8 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, that's 48 full blocks (48 times) plus the partial block of 8 pages (481-488), where 8 appears once in the units place (page 488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 pages, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in pages 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is actually 9 pages because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. Therefore, 0 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the tens place of 8, I thought the remaining pages after 400 are 401-488, which is 88 pages. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, that's pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, 9 occurrences, which I added to the 40 from the full hundreds, giving 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, since 488 is less than 800, there are no 8's there. So, 0. That's correct.\n\nFor the units place, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, and the last 8 pages (481-488) include page 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. The difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 pages, 4 appears once. For 488 pages, there are 48 full blocks of 10 and an additional 8 pages. Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** In every 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. With 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred, we have 4 * 10 + 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** From page 400 to 488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** In every 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times. With 4 full hundreds and a partial hundred (480-488), we have 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " They go from 1 to 488, right? So each page number is a number between 1 and 488, and each digit in those numbers can be a 4 or an 8, or something else. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let me start by considering the different places where digits can appear: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. Since 488 is a three-digit number, we'll have to consider all three places. Maybe I should handle each place separately and then add up the counts.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, same with the digit 8. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers. In each of those 48 sets, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So that's 48 times for 4 and 48 times for 8. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So for the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, the difference here is 0. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So in each block of 100 numbers, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each digit (including 4 and 8), it appears 10 times in the tens place per 100 numbers. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same with the digit 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8 in the tens place. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see: the tens digit cycles as 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-490). But since we're only going up to 488, the last part is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers, so 8 times. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the tens digit is 8 in 481-490, but we only have up to 488, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 each, the total for 4 in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit different because it's only non-zero in the ranges 1-999, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see: from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're starting from 1, maybe it's better to think of it as 0 in the hundreds place. But in page numbers, I think the hundreds digit is only present if the number is 100 or above. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in the numbers 400-488. Let's figure out how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, does the digit 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total for the hundreds place is 89 times for 4 and 0 times for 8, making a difference of 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each place. \n\n- Units place: 0 difference\n- Tens place: +2\n- Hundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because 91 seems a bit high, and I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with the units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and same for 8, so difference 0. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full centuries, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So 4 * 10 = 40 each. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410 (10 numbers), 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding to the 40 each, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8. So, difference is 2. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, difference here is 89. So total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When considering the hundreds place, does 400-488 include all the numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive? Yes, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all of these, so 89 times. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit being 4, it's from 440-449, but wait, 440 is 440, which is in 401-488. Wait, 440 is 440, which is within 401-488, right? So, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times the tens digit is 4. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, it's 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, ..., up to 488. So that's 9 numbers, not 8. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480 is included, right? So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 8. Hmm, so I think I made a mistake there. I thought it was 8 numbers, but it's actually 9.\n\nWait, let me count: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, not 8. So, in the tens place, in the partial block 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding to the previous 40 each, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 49 = 1, not 2. Hmm, so that changes things.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the last partial block was 401-488, which is 88 numbers. Let me confirm: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 numbers, which is 8 full decades (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490), but since 488 is the last page, the last decade is only up to 488, so the last decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, but 481-490 is a full decade, but we only have 488, so it's 8 numbers. Wait, so in the tens place, the digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 9. So, perhaps I was correct the first time. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, 480-489 is the decade where the tens digit is 8. But since our book ends at 488, the numbers with tens digit 8 are 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, 480 is included, right? So, 480 is in 401-488, so the tens digit 8 occurs 9 times in the last partial block. So, in the tens place, 4 occurs 10 times (440-449) and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, adding to the 40 each, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, the difference is 1. Therefore, the total difference from the tens place is +1, not +2.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the last partial block only had 8 numbers, but now I'm seeing 9. Let me check: 480 is included, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers. So, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial block. So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, difference is +1.\n\nSo, correcting that, the tens place contributes a difference of +1, not +2. So, now, let's recalculate the total difference.\n\nUnits place: 0\nTens place: +1\nHundreds place: +89\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so now the total difference is 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake elsewhere.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Same for 8: 48 times in full decades, and once in the last partial decade (at 488), so 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place: 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times, difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, then 90, so I think 90 is the correct difference now.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me try a different approach. Maybe instead of breaking it down by place, I can count the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nFirst, count the number of 4's in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's count the number of times 4 appears in each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\nAs before, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full centuries, each contributing 10 times for 4 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nUnits place:\nSame as 4's: 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. In the last partial decade (481-488), 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full centuries, each contributing 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\nAs before, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with my earlier calculation after correcting the tens place count. So, the answer should be 90.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, in the last partial block, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 4's have 10 more in the tens place, but wait, no, in the full centuries, both 4's and 8's have 40 each. Then, in the last partial block, 4's get 10 more, and 8's get 9 more. So, 4's have 50, 8's have 49, so difference +1.\n\nUnits place is equal for both, so total difference is 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 fours. The last 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more four (484). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 full centuries (1-400) contribute 40 fours. The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 fours (440-449). Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 fours. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full decades contribute 48 eights. The last 8 pages add 1 more eight (488). Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 full centuries contribute 40 eights. The last 88 pages add 9 eights (480-488). Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No eights appear. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nAlright, let's start by understanding how many times the digits 4 and 8 appear in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. I think it's best to handle each digit position separately because the frequency of each digit can vary depending on the position.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, in the numbers 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each. Now, looking at the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 8 appears once (at 488), and the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. \n\nSo, adding that up, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that can't be right because the 48th set ends at 480, and the next set starts at 481. So, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once, and 4 doesn't appear in the units place there. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, the first 480 pages have 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, pages 481 to 488 add an extra 8 in the units place, so 8's total is 48 + 1 = 49, while 4's remain at 48. So, in the units place, 4's are 48, 8's are 49. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here because page 488 is included, so from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1 to 8, so 8 appears once. So yes, 48 4's and 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, in the tens place, 4 appears from 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears from 80-89, which is 10 times. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Let's break this down.\n\nIn the first hundred (1-99), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nIn the second hundred (100-199), the tens digit again cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\nSimilarly, in the third hundred (200-299), 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\nIn the fourth hundred (300-399), 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\nNow, the fifth hundred is 400-488. Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit cycles 0-8, but not all digits appear 10 times. Let's see:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 2: 420-429 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 3: 430-439 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 4: 440-449 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 5: 450-459 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 6: 460-469 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479 (10 pages)\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488 (9 pages, since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 400-488, 4 appears in the tens place from 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place for 4's: 10 (from 0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 50 times.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 10 (0-99) + 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 only appears 9 times because it's from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, let's see:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many times? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 times. Wait, no, that's the number of pages, but each page number has the hundreds digit as 4, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. \n\nAs for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there's no page with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all digit positions.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, let me double-check that because when I added up the units place earlier, I thought 4's were 48 and 8's were 49. Then in the tens place, 4's were 50 and 8's were 49. So, adding those up:\n\n4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but that seems high. Let me check each step again.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place? Every 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) don't add any more 4's in the units place. So, 48 4's in units.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the remaining 8 pages, 8 appears once (at 488), so total 49 8's in units.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 pages where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (0-399), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\nSimilarly, each hundred has 10 pages where tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (0-399), each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: From 400-488, which is 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4, so 89 times.\n\n8's: None, since the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the units and tens places again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 4's: 48 (from 1-480, 48 sets of 10)\n- 8's: 48 (from 1-480) + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 4 hundreds (0-399) * 10 each = 40, plus 10 in 440-449 = 50\n- 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 each = 40, plus 9 in 480-488 = 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 (400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. We analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- 4 appears once every 10 pages. With 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, that's 48 times.\n- 8 appears once every 10 pages, also 48 times, plus once in 488, totaling 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- 4 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 40-49), totaling 40 times in the first 400 pages, plus 10 more in 440-449, totaling 50.\n- 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, totaling 40 times in the first 400 pages, plus 9 times in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times in 400-488.\n- 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.

Let me start by counting the number of 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nFor the units place, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. Now, I need to figure out how many such blocks there are up to page 488.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so maybe I should adjust for that. Let me think. From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). But wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48, since 48*10=480, and then 481-488 is 8 more pages.\n\nSo, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. Now, for the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so in these, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, there's one more 4 and one more 8. Wait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the units digits are 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nSo, same number so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? Well, 4*100=400, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages after that (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, in the 4 complete blocks, 4's in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40\n8's in tens place: 4 blocks * 10 = 40\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's see how the tens digit behaves here. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0. From 410-419, tens digit is 1. Similarly, up to 488, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page), so 9 times.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. 401-488 is 88 pages, starting from 401 (tens digit 0) up to 488 (tens digit 8). So, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8. Wait, no, that's not quite right because 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens blocks (each 10 pages) plus 8 pages. Wait, no, perhaps a better way is to see that from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but 480-488 is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, but 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times, while the other digits (including 4) appear 10 times each.\n\nWait, but let's confirm. From 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0: 401-409 \u2192 9 pages\n- 1: 410-419 \u2192 10 pages\n- 2: 420-429 \u2192 10 pages\n- 3: 430-439 \u2192 10 pages\n- 4: 440-449 \u2192 10 pages\n- 5: 450-459 \u2192 10 pages\n- 6: 460-469 \u2192 10 pages\n- 7: 470-479 \u2192 10 pages\n- 8: 480-488 \u2192 9 pages\n\nWait, so actually, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. The other digits from 1 to 7 appear 10 times each, and digit 4 also appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449).\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier thought. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- 4's: 10\n- 8's: 9\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 401-488) = 49\n\nWait, so that's 50 4's and 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nWell, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, number of 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400 is page 400, and 488 is the last page, so the number of pages from 400 to 488 inclusive is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through each place again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 pages, 4 appears once in the units place. So, number of complete decades is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then from 481-488, which is 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 complete decades with 8 once each, and then 8 appears once in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, from 1-100, 100-199, etc., each has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 400 pages, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, how many 4's and 8's in the tens place?\n\nAs I thought earlier, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-409) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, except the last one, each appears 10 times. But wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens blocks (each 10 pages) plus 8 pages. Wait, no, that's not correct because 88 is 8*11, which is 8 full tens blocks (80 pages) plus 8 pages. Wait, perhaps a better way is to see that from 401-488, the tens digits are:\n\n- 0: 401-409 \u2192 9 pages\n- 1: 410-419 \u2192 10 pages\n- 2: 420-429 \u2192 10 pages\n- 3: 430-439 \u2192 10 pages\n- 4: 440-449 \u2192 10 pages\n- 5: 450-459 \u2192 10 pages\n- 6: 460-469 \u2192 10 pages\n- 7: 470-479 \u2192 10 pages\n- 8: 480-488 \u2192 9 pages\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, in 401-488, 4's in tens place: 10\n8's in tens place: 9\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1). So, 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me just verify once more.\n\nWait, another way to count the number of times a digit appears in each place is to use the formula for digit frequency.\n\nIn the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is given by:\n\nfloor(n/10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nfloor(n/100) * 10 + max(0, (n % 100) - d*10 + 1)\n\nAnd for the hundreds place:\n\nfloor(n/1000) * 100 + max(0, (n % 1000) - d*100 + 1)\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a formula where for each digit place, the count is calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to stick with my initial method.\n\nWait, let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I had 50 and 8's as 49, which seems correct because in the last partial block, 4's appeared 10 times and 8's only 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, units place both had 49.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 +89=188\n8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page is a number in that range.\n\nI remember that when dealing with digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately\u2014like units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, maybe I should analyze how often the digits 4 and 8 appear in each place (units, tens, hundreds) from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digits 1 through 0 appear once each in the units place. Then it repeats from 11 to 20, 21 to 30, and so on. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each full block, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. Therefore, in 48 blocks, each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nBut wait, we have an extra 8 pages after the 48th block. Those are pages 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits here: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in the units place of this extra block, the digit 4 appears once (page 484) and the digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, in total, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, for the units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nHmm, so the difference in the units place is zero. Now, let me move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 0-9) to 9 (for 90-99), each appearing 10 times. Then it repeats for each subsequent hundred.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds and an extra 88 pages. Let me calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (40-49), and the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (80-89). So, for each hundred, both digits appear 10 times in the tens place. Since there are 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages go from 401 to 488. Wait, no, actually, the full hundreds would be 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then the next set is 401-488. So, the tens digit in 401-488: Let's see, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; 421-430, tens digit is 2; 431-440, tens digit is 3; 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; 461-470, tens digit is 6; 471-480, tens digit is 7; 481-488, tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, so in the extra 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place? Let's break it down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8 (8 numbers)\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It's 10 times in 441-450. How about 8? It's 8 times in 481-488.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the extra 88 pages. Therefore, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the extra, so 50 times.\n- 8: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the extra, so 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. The difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (but since we're starting at 1, maybe we don't count 0). From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. How about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's.\n\nWait, that's a significant number. So, let me sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 49 - 49 = 0\n- Tens place: 50 - 48 = +2\n- Hundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems quite high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the hundreds place. So, from 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnd since 8 can't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, that's correct. So, 89 more 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's, so 2 more 4's.\n\nUnits place: both digits appear 49 times, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 89 + 2 = 91. So, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. I had 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for 4 in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50. For 8: 4*10 + 8 = 48. So, 50 vs. 48, which is a difference of +2. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the units place, but since we have 488 pages, which is 48 full tens and 8 extra. Wait, actually, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of 10. So, in 488 pages, how many full tens are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In those 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8. So, difference is 0.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: hundreds place +2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91. So, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all, that's 89 more 4's right there.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems correct. So, the total number of 4's printed is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Wait, no, wait, I think I'm mixing up the counts. Wait, no, I think I should sum up the counts for each digit.\n\nWait, no, actually, the way I calculated it is, for each digit place, I calculated how many times 4 and 8 appear. So, the total number of 4's is units_4 + tens_4 + hundreds_4, and similarly for 8's.\n\nSo, units_4 = 49, tens_4 = 50, hundreds_4 = 89. So, total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, units_8 = 49, tens_8 = 48, hundreds_8 = 0. So, total 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. So, 4's appear 91 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the total number of digits printed. From 1 to 488, how many digits are there? Let's see, pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each: 9 digits. Pages 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each: 180 digits. Pages 100-488: 488 - 99 = 389 pages, 3 digits each: 389 * 3 = 1167 digits. So total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total digits for 4's: 188. For 8's: 97. So, total digits accounted for by 4 and 8: 188 + 97 = 285. The rest are other digits. But that's just a sanity check.\n\nWait, but 1356 total digits, and 285 are 4's and 8's, that seems plausible.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. The difference is 91.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 only in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the extra, plus 4*10=40 from the full hundreds, totaling 48.\n\nSimilarly, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in the extra (441-450), plus 40 from the full hundreds, totaling 50.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so the difference is 91. So, 4's are printed 91 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full tens (480 pages) and an additional 8 pages (481-488).\n   - In each full ten, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place: 48 times each.\n   - In the additional 8 pages, both 4 (page 484) and 8 (page 488) appear once.\n   - **Total Units Place:**\n     - 4: 48 + 1 = 49\n     - 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages) and an additional 88 pages (401-488).\n   - In each full hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place: 40 times each.\n   - In the additional 88 pages:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (pages 441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (pages 481-488).\n   - **Total Tens Place:**\n     - 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - 8: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n   - The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4: 89\n     - 8: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 91 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8 and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there?\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is the total number of complete groups of 10 in 488, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we take the integer part, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In those extra numbers, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear in the units place in the extra. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place.\n\nTo find how many such blocks there are up to 488, I can divide 488 by 100, which gives 4.88. Taking the integer part, that's 4 full hundreds. But wait, each hundred contributes one block of ten where the tens digit is 4. So, 4 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. But wait, the last block might be incomplete. Let me check: 400-488. The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is a full block of 10. So, yes, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 instances of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48 + 40 is 88, plus 89 is 177. So, 177 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 instances of the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds. Each hundred contributes one block where the tens digit is 8, so 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. But wait, in the last hundred (400-488), the block 480-489 would be the next, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is present from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last block. So, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Each full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes one block of 10 where the tens digit is 8. So, for 1-100, 80-89: 10 times. For 101-200, 180-189: 10 times. Similarly, 280-289: 10 times, and 380-389: 10 times. That's 4 blocks, each 10 times, so 40 times. Now, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check the tens place. From 80-89: 10 times, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49 and the tens place 49, but let me make sure. Units place: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once in 488, so total units 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: As above, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 177, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 177 - 98 = 79.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 48 times.\n\nTens place: 40 times (from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5 x10=50 times. Wait, earlier I thought it was 4 blocks, but actually, up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, the tens place for 4's: 50 times, not 40.\n\nSimilarly, the hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, units: 48, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 48 +50 +89= 187.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate.\n\nUnits place for 4's: every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in units. 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 appears in 484, so that's one more. So, total units 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, earlier I thought units 4's were 48, but now I'm getting 49. Let me check: numbers ending with 4 up to 488: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, last term 484. The difference between terms is 10. So, number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in units place.\n\nSimilarly, tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\nFrom 40-49: 10 numbers.\n\n140-149: 10.\n\n240-249:10.\n\n340-349:10.\n\n440-449:10.\n\nThat's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 5 blocks.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 49+50=99+89=188.\n\nWait, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nEarlier, I thought 4's were 177, but now I'm getting 188. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nSimilarly, let's recalculate 8's.\n\nUnits place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms?\n\nFirst term 8, last term 488. Difference 480, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10, so 4 x10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: no 8's, as before.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo, now, 4's are 188, 8's are 98. Difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 177, but now I'm getting 188. I think I made a mistake in the initial count by not considering the last block in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me make sure again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:49.\n\nTens:5 blocks, each 10, so 50.\n\nHundreds:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49.\n\nTens:49.\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting results. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, so 5 blocks, 50 times.\n\nUnits place for 4's: numbers ending with 4 up to 488:4,14,...,484. As calculated, 49 numbers.\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49.\n\nTens:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nFirst four blocks:4 x10=40.\n\nLast block:480-488:9 numbers.\n\nSo, tens place:40+9=49.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 177, but now 188. I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, 5 blocks of 10, so 50 times.\n\nUnits place:49 times.\n\nSo, total 188.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. When counting the tens place for 4's, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's a full block. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4 blocks, but no, it's 5 blocks because 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n\nSo, 4's total:188.\n\n8's:98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check another way.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\n- For 4's: as calculated, 49 times.\n\n- For 8's:49 times.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\n- For 4's:50 times.\n\n- For 8's:49 times.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\n- For 4's:89 times.\n\n- For 8's:0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct now. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400 to 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Total tens place 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " They start from 1 and go up to 488, so each page number is a one, two, three, or four-digit number. I guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out the difference.\n\nLet me start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be categorized based on the number of digits they have:\n\n1. **1-digit page numbers:** These are from 1 to 9. There are 9 such pages.\n2. **2-digit page numbers:** These go from 10 to 99. There are 90 pages here (99 - 10 + 1).\n3. **3-digit page numbers:** These are from 100 to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so I need to calculate how many 3-digit pages there are. From 100 to 488, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 pages.\n\nWait, but actually, 488 is a 3-digit number, so yes, all pages from 100 to 488 are 3-digit. So, 389 pages in total.\n\nNow, I need to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me handle the 4's first.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In 1-digit numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - In 2-digit numbers (10-99), the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 10 to 99, the digit 4 appears in the units place once every 10 numbers (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94). There are 9 such decades (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), so 9 times 1 = 9 times.\n   - In 3-digit numbers (100-488), the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194; same for other hundreds). But wait, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the units digit 4 will still appear in 404, 414, ..., 484. Let me calculate how many hundreds there are.\n\n   From 100-199: 100 numbers, units digit 4 appears 10 times.\n   From 200-299: another 10 times.\n   From 300-399: another 10 times.\n   From 400-488: Now, from 400-488, the units digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. How many full decades are there in 400-488? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 8 full decades (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, 89 pages: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 8 full decades (each 10 pages) and 9 extra pages (481-488). So, in each full decade, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 8 times. But wait, 480-488 is the 9th decade, but it's only 9 pages (480-488 inclusive). So, in 480-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units digit 4's in 400-488: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (484) = 9 times.\n\n   Wait, but actually, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, yes, 9 times.\n\n   So, total units digit 4's in 3-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\n   Now, adding up all units digit 4's:\n   - 1-digit: 1\n   - 2-digit: 9\n   - 3-digit: 39\n   Total units digit 4's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In 1-digit numbers, there's no tens digit, so 0.\n   - In 2-digit numbers (10-99), the tens digit 4 appears in the range 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n   - In 3-digit numbers (100-488), the tens digit 4 can appear in two ways:\n     a. In the hundreds place as 1,2,3, or 4, but we're looking at the tens digit.\n     b. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 numbers.\n     Similarly, in 200-299: 240-249, 10 numbers.\n     In 300-399: 340-349, 10 numbers.\n     In 400-488: The tens digit 4 would be in 440-449, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so 10 numbers.\n\n   So, in 3-digit numbers, tens digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and there are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 10 times in each hundred, so 4 hundreds would give 40 times. Wait, but actually, 400-488 is only 89 pages, but the tens digit 4 in 400-488 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's fine.\n\n   So, total tens digit 4's in 3-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\n   Now, adding up all tens digit 4's:\n   - 1-digit: 0\n   - 2-digit: 10\n   - 3-digit: 40\n   Total tens digit 4's: 0 + 10 + 40 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - In 1-digit and 2-digit numbers, no hundreds digit, so 0.\n   - In 3-digit numbers (100-488), the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n     a. For hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the hundreds digit is 4. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times. But wait, actually, each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, so yes, 89 times.\n\n   So, hundreds digit 4's: 89 times.\n\n   Now, total hundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\n   Adding up all hundreds digit 4's:\n   - 1-digit: 0\n   - 2-digit: 0\n   - 3-digit: 89\n   Total hundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\nNow, total number of 4's in all page numbers is the sum of units, tens, and hundreds digits:\n\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89. In the tens place, in each hundred, 10 times, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10, so 40. In the units place, 1 (1-digit) + 9 (2-digit) + 39 (3-digit) = 49. So, 89 + 40 + 49 = 178. Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. 89 + 40 is 129, plus 49 is 178, not 188. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) = 129. Then, 129 + 49 (units) = 178. So, total 4's: 178.\n\nHmm, that seems more accurate. So, I think I added wrong earlier.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\nI'll do the same approach, counting in units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 1-digit numbers (1-9): 8 appears once (page 8).\n   - 2-digit numbers (10-99): The units digit cycles every 10, so 8 appears once per decade. There are 9 decades (10-19, ..., 90-99), so 9 times.\n   - 3-digit numbers (100-488): The units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's see how many times.\n\n   For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, except possibly the last hundred (400-488) if it doesn't complete the cycle.\n\n   From 100-199: 10 times (108, 118, ..., 198).\n   From 200-299: 10 times.\n   From 300-399: 10 times.\n   From 400-488: Let's see, from 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? It's 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included.\n\n   So, units digit 8's in 3-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n   Now, total units digit 8's:\n   - 1-digit: 1\n   - 2-digit: 9\n   - 3-digit: 39\n   Total units digit 8's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 1-digit numbers: 0.\n   - 2-digit numbers (10-99): The tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n   - 3-digit numbers (100-488): The tens digit 8 appears in each hundred block as 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n\n   Let's break it down:\n   - 100-199: 180-189, 10 numbers.\n   - 200-299: 280-289, 10 numbers.\n   - 300-399: 380-389, 10 numbers.\n   - 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, the digit is 8 for all these, so 9 times.\n\n   So, tens digit 8's in 3-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\n   Now, total tens digit 8's:\n   - 1-digit: 0\n   - 2-digit: 10\n   - 3-digit: 39\n   Total tens digit 8's: 0 + 10 + 39 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 1-digit and 2-digit numbers: 0.\n   - 3-digit numbers: The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0.\n\n   So, hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all hundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nNow, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds:\n\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 49 is 98? Let me check again.\n\nWait, units digit 8's: 49.\n\nTens digit 8's: 49.\n\nHundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit low. Let me double-check the counts.\n\nFor units digit 8's:\n\n1-digit: 1 (page 8).\n\n2-digit: 10-99: 9 decades, each contributing 1, so 9.\n\n3-digit: 100-488: 100-199: 10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9 (since 488 is included). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal units: 1+9+39=49.\n\nTens digit 8's:\n\n1-digit: 0.\n\n2-digit: 80-89: 10.\n\n3-digit: 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9 (since 488 is included).\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal tens: 0+10+39=49.\n\nHundreds digit 8's: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, total 4's: 178.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nUnits digit 4's: 49.\n\nTens digit 4's: 50.\n\nHundreds digit 4's: 89.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 49+50+89=188, but then I realized it should be 49+50=99, plus 89=188, but then I thought maybe I was wrong and recalculated to 178. Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the hundreds digit, 400-488 is 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89.\n\nIn the tens digit, for 4's:\n\nIn 2-digit numbers: 40-49: 10.\n\nIn 3-digit numbers: 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So that's 4 x 10 = 40.\n\nSo, tens digit 4's: 10 (2-digit) + 40 (3-digit) = 50.\n\nUnits digit 4's:\n\n1-digit: 1.\n\n2-digit: 14,24,...,94: 9.\n\n3-digit: 104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,...,484:9 (since 488 is the last page, so 404,414,...,484: that's 9 numbers). So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, units digit 4's: 1+9+39=49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, that's correct. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about 3-digit units digit 4's, I thought 10+10+10+9=39, which is correct. So, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: 188.\n\nBut then for 8's, I had 49 units, 49 tens, 0 hundreds: 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 178 - 98 = 80, but that was a miscalculation. Wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in the 4's count. Let me recount the 4's.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 400-488: 89 pages, each with a hundreds digit of 4: 89.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- 2-digit: 40-49: 10.\n- 3-digit: 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. So, 4 x 10 = 40.\n\nTotal tens digit 4's: 10 + 40 = 50.\n\nUnits digit 4's:\n\n- 1-digit: 1.\n- 2-digit: 14,24,...,94: 9.\n- 3-digit: 104,114,...,194:10; 204,...,294:10; 304,...,394:10; 404,...,484:9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal units digit 4's: 1+9+39=49.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits digit 8's:\n\n- 1-digit:1.\n- 2-digit:10-99:9.\n- 3-digit:100-488:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal:1+9+39=49.\n\nTens digit 8's:\n\n- 2-digit:10.\n- 3-digit:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal:10+39=49.\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, difference:188 - 98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 178 - 98=80, but that was a miscalculation. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because 188-98=90, yes.\n\nWait, but I think I might have overcounted the 4's in the hundreds place. Let me think: from 400 to 488, how many numbers have hundreds digit 4? It's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, for 4's, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nIn the units place, 400-488 includes 404,414,...,484, which is 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, 39 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: 188.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0: 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a chance I double-counted any digits? For example, in 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so it's counted once in units, once in tens, and once in hundreds. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in 888, if it were within the range, it would be counted three times, but since the book only goes up to 488, 888 isn't included.\n\nWait, but in our case, 444 is included, so that's fine.\n\nSo, I think the correct difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 178-98=80, but that was a miscalculation. So, the correct answer should be 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's count again.\n\nUnits digit 4's:\n\n1-digit:1.\n\n2-digit:9.\n\n3-digit:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal:1+9=10; 10+39=49.\n\nTens digit 4's:\n\n2-digit:10.\n\n3-digit:10+10+10+10=40.\n\nTotal:10+40=50.\n\nHundreds digit 4's:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits digit 8's:\n\n1-digit:1.\n\n2-digit:9.\n\n3-digit:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal:1+9=10; 10+39=49.\n\nTens digit 8's:\n\n2-digit:10.\n\n3-digit:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTotal:10+39=49.\n\nHundreds digit 8's:0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units digit 4's in 3-digit numbers. Let me recount.\n\nIn 100-199: units digit 4 appears in 104,114,...,194: that's 10 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299:204,214,...,294:10.\n\n300-399:304,...,394:10.\n\n400-488:404,414,...,484: let's see, starting from 404, each 10 pages:404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\nIn 400-488:408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488: that's 9 numbers.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, I think 90 is the correct difference.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 1-digit numbers (1-9): 1 occurrence (page 4).\n     - 2-digit numbers (10-99): 9 occurrences (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - 3-digit numbers (100-488): \n       - 100-199: 10 (104, 114, ..., 194).\n       - 200-299: 10.\n       - 300-399: 10.\n       - 400-488: 9 (404, 414, ..., 484).\n     - Total units digit '4's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 2-digit numbers (10-99): 10 occurrences (40-49).\n     - 3-digit numbers (100-488):\n       - 100-199: 10 (140-149).\n       - 200-299: 10.\n       - 300-399: 10.\n       - 400-488: 10 (440-449).\n     - Total tens digit '4's: 10 + 40 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 3-digit numbers (100-488): 89 occurrences (400-488).\n     - Total hundreds digit '4's: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 1-digit numbers (1-9): 1 occurrence (page 8).\n     - 2-digit numbers (10-99): 9 occurrences (18, 28, ..., 98).\n     - 3-digit numbers (100-488):\n       - 100-199: 10 (108, 118, ..., 198).\n       - 200-299: 10.\n       - 300-399: 10.\n       - 400-488: 9 (408, 418, ..., 488).\n     - Total units digit '8's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 2-digit numbers (10-99): 10 occurrences (80-89).\n     - 3-digit numbers (100-488):\n       - 100-199: 10 (180-189).\n       - 200-299: 10.\n       - 300-399: 10.\n       - 400-488: 9 (480-488).\n     - Total tens digit '8's: 10 + 39 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No pages in 1-488 have a hundreds digit of '8'.\n     - Total hundreds digit '8's: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188.\n   - Number of '8's: 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? From 1 to 488. But wait, actually, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', and so on. So, the page numbers can be one, two, or three digits long. That might complicate things a bit, but maybe I can handle it by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. The digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So, in each set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. Therefore, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48*1 + however many 4's are in the extra 8 pages. Wait, the extra pages are from 481 to 488, so the units digits here are 1 through 8. So, in the units place, the extra pages contribute one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that's an extra 8. So, in the units place, 4's: 48*1 +1=49, and 8's:48*1 +1=49. So, units place contributes equally, 49 each.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Each full set of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's:48+1=49, and 8's:48+1=49. So, units place is tied.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages, right? Each group of 100 has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, for each 100 pages, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens place contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages: from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 481-488). Wait, but 401-488 is 88 pages, so let's see how the tens digit behaves.\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0\n411-420: tens digit is 1\n421-430: tens digit is 2\n431-440: tens digit is 3\n441-450: tens digit is 4\n451-460: tens digit is 5\n461-470: tens digit is 6\n471-480: tens digit is 7\n481-490: tens digit is 8, but we only go up to 488, so it's 481-488, which is 8 pages.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the extra 88 pages:\n\n- Tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n- Tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 8's.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for the extra 88 pages, we have 10 4's and 8 8's.\n\nAdding this to the full hundreds: total 4's in tens place = 40 +10=50, and 8's in tens place=40+8=48.\n\nSo, the tens place contributes 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place contributes 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's = 49+50+89= 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's =49+48+0=97\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each, plus the extra 8 pages (481-488) contributing 1 4 (484) and 1 8 (488). So, units:49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 pages) and 8 in 481-488 (8 pages). So, 10 4's and 8 8's. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 4's, 40+8=48 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's, and 0 8's. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Total 8's:49+48+0=97. Difference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me think about how to count the occurrences of a specific digit in a range of numbers. I remember that for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times a particular digit appears. So, I'll need to consider each position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, I'll count how many times it appears in each position.\n\nFirst, the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, from 1-400, there are 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Then, from 400-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is within 488. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units place (48) + Tens place (50) + Hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place except the last one, which only goes up to 488, so 9 numbers (480-488) have 8 in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many complete blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks, but the last one only has 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, so 4 * 10 = 40, and the last block contributes 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The tens digit is 8 for numbers where the tens place is 8. So, for each hundred, it's 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in 1-100, 80-89: 10 times. In 101-200, 180-189: 10 times. Similarly, 280-289: 10 times, 380-389: 10 times, and 480-489: but since we stop at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units place (49) + Tens place (49) + Hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Did I count correctly?\n\nFor units place: 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488), so total 49.\n\nFor tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4 hundreds (1-400) would give 4*10=40, and then in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 in tens place.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nNow, total 4's were 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again. Did I count correctly?\n\nUnits place: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial ten (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484), so total 48 +1=49? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. When I was counting 4's in the units place, I said 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's:48 +1=49. But earlier, I thought it was 48, but that was a mistake. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, no, when I did the 4's earlier, I said that in the units place, it's 48 times, because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 4 appears once, making it 49. But in my initial calculation, I said 48, which was wrong. Wait, so I need to correct that.\n\nWait, so let's redo the 4's count.\n\nUnits place: For 4's, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 groups of 10, so 48 times. Then, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For 4's, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 187, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nUnits place:48 (from 1-480) +1 (484)=49.\n\nTens place:5 blocks (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nHundreds place:400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nSo, 49+50=99, plus 89=188.\n\nSo, total 4's:188.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:48 (from 1-480) +1 (488)=49.\n\nTens place:4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nTherefore, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial calculation.\n\nWait, let's confirm again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:49\n\nTotal:98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, hundreds place:0, correct.\n\nTens place for 4's:5 blocks of 10, so 50.\n\nTens place for 8's:4 blocks of 10 and 9, so 49.\n\nUnits place for 4's:49.\n\nUnits place for 8's:49.\n\nSo, yes, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but in my initial calculation, I thought it was 187-98=89, but that was because I had miscounted the units place for 4's as 48 instead of 49.\n\nSo, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 4's. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more at 484. So, total 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full groups, 48, plus in the last 8 numbers, 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, units place for both digits is 49. Then, tens place for 4's is 50, and for 8's is 49. Hundreds place for 4's is 89, and for 8's is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe digit 4 appears 188 times, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right?\n\nSo, the book has pages from 1 to 488. That means the page numbers can be 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), or three-digit (100-488). I guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each position separately.\n\n1. **Units place for 4:**\n   - In the units place, 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? That would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48. So that's 48 times. But wait, the last group might not be complete. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the last group is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in this case, the units digit 4 appears once in each group, so 48 times from 1-480, and then in 484, which is in the 480-488 range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4:**\n   - In the tens place, 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears from 40-49, which is 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0-8. So does 4 appear in the tens place here? Let's see, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So the tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488? No, 440 is in the 400-499 range, but our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times here as well. So total tens place 4's would be 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nWait, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So yes, that's correct. So 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and the last is 488. So yes, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nSo total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nHmm, wait, let me double-check that addition. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place for 8:**\n   - Similar to 4, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last group (481-490, but our book ends at 488), so 488 is included. So 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8:**\n   - In the tens place, 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So from 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred from 401-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 appears from 80-89, which is 10 times. So 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0-8. So the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, but wait, 480-489 would be in the 400-499 range, but our book goes up to 488, so from 480-488, the tens digit is 8. So that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So 9 times. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the hundreds place, each complete hundred contributes 10 times for the tens digit 8. So 4 times 10 is 40. Then in the partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. So 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nLet me go through the 4's again.\n\nUnits place for 4: from 1-488, every 10 numbers has one 4 in the units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), there's 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place for 4: every 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So 4 times 10 is 40. Then in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So total 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. That's correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49 times.\n\nTens place: every 100 numbers, 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers with tens digit 8, so 9. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 8, I counted 49, but let me check again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So that's 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit 8. So yes, 49.\n\nSo the difference is 90. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1-480) plus one more in 484.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - In 1-400: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488: 440-449 adds 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1-480) plus one more in 488.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - In 1-400: 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - In 401-488: 480-488 adds 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives me 48 fours. But wait, in the last group, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then there are 8 more pages. So actually, the 48th group is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So maybe it's 49 fours in the units place? Wait, no, because from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go 1-8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so that adds one more, making it 49. Okay, so units place: 49 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So how many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, from 1-100, there's 40-49, that's one group of 10 numbers, contributing one 4 in the tens place each, so 10 fours. Then from 101-200, 140-149, another 10 fours. Similarly, 240-249, another 10, and 340-349, another 10. Now, from 400-488, the next group would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So how many groups is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five groups, each contributing 10 fours. So 5 times 10 is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So that's indeed 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 8 appears once. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So 48 eights. But wait, in the last partial group from 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. So in that partial group, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nNext, tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So how many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 eights.\nFrom 101-200: 180-189, another 10.\nFrom 201-300: 280-289, another 10.\nFrom 301-400: 380-389, another 10.\nFrom 401-488: 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo adding up: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. From 1-100: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights in tens place.\nSimilarly, each subsequent hundred adds another 10, except the last one which only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So total tens place eights: 4 times 10 (from the first four hundreds) plus 9, which is 40 + 9 = 49. So that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 8's. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so the number of times 8 appears in the units place is the number of complete decades plus any in the partial decade.\n\nNumber of complete decades: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8. Then, in the partial decade from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as we calculated, it's 49.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, in the range 481-488, 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding 1 more. Total units place fours: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such groups up to 440-449, each contributing 10 fours. Total tens place fours: 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Total hundreds place fours: 89.\n   - **Total Fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 eights. Additionally, 488 adds 1 more. Total units place eights: 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 complete groups contributing 40 eights, and in 480-488, there are 9 eights. Total tens place eights: 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place up to 488. Total hundreds place eights: 0.\n   - **Total Eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 all the way up to 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately\u2014like the units place, tens place, and hundreds place. So, maybe I should calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference between the two totals.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern continues every 10 pages. So, for every 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once per each group of 10) plus one more time in the 490th page, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so actually, the last group is from 481 to 488. So, in the units place, 4 appears in 481, 484, 487, etc. Wait, no, that's not right because I'm only looking at units digit. So, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in the units place in this last partial group, and 8 appears once as well. Therefore, total units digit 4's would be 48 (from the full groups) plus 1, making it 49. Similarly, units digit 8's would be 48 plus 1, so also 49. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, so 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So yes, units digit counts are 49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). So, in each hundred, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nHow many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages in the fifth hundred (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, let's see: the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so that's 9 pages (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, adding that to the full hundreds, the total tens digit 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's would be 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that. Actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is zero, while 4's count is 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nUnits place:\n- 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n- Last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, total 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n- Each full hundred (1-100, etc.) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n- In the last partial hundred (401-488), tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 50 for 4 and 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 never appears.\n\nSo, adding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 full groups of 10 pages: 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488 add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 pages contribute ten 4's and ten 8's.\n   - 4 full hundreds: 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488: 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So pages 1 to 9 are single digits, 10 to 99 are two digits, and 100 to 488 are three digits. \n\nI guess I should count the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference. Let me start with the 4's.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers: from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears once, which is on page 4. So that's one 4. The digit 8 appears once on page 8. So so far, 4's are ahead by 0, since both have one each.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit numbers: pages 10 to 99. I think I should consider the units place and the tens place separately.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers: from 10 to 99, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, actually, it's 9 times for each digit except maybe for the tens place. Wait, no, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So each digit from 0 to 9 appears 9 times in the units place. So for 4, that's 9 times, and for 8, that's also 9 times.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers: the tens digit ranges from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So for each tens digit, like 10-19, the tens digit is 1, appearing 10 times. So for 4 in the tens place, that's pages 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, pages 80-89, which is 10 times.\n\nSo in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19 times, and the digit 8 appears 9 + 10 = 19 times. So again, they're equal so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: pages 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit for 4 is only up to 488, not 499.\n\nLet me break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at most. So 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred block separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 pages. So for each ten's digit, it appears 10 times. So for 4 in the tens place, that's 10 times (140-149). Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, that's 10 times (180-189). So 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Same logic. 4 in tens place: 240-249, 10 times. 8 in tens place: 280-289, 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Similarly, 4 in tens place: 340-349, 10 times. 8 in tens place: 380-389, 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, this is a bit different because it doesn't go up to 499. So the tens digit here can be from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So for 4 in the tens place, that's 440-449, which is 10 pages. But for 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 pages. So in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo adding up the tens place across all hundreds:\n\n- 4 appears 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 times.\n- 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred block.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So for each digit, it appears 10 times per hundred. So 4 appears 10 times in units place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Now, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So for each units digit, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages. Each units digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, except for 8, which appears 9 times as well because 488 ends with 8. Wait, let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers. The units digit cycles every 10, so 89 divided by 10 is 8 full cycles (80 numbers) and 9 extra numbers. So in each digit 0-9, they appear 8 times, and then in the last partial cycle (480-488), digits 0-8 appear once each, so total for each digit 0-8 is 8 + 1 = 9 times, and 9 doesn't appear at all in the units place beyond the full cycles. Wait, no, 488 is included, so units digit 8 appears once more. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, from 400-488, the units digit for each digit 0-8 appears exactly 9 times because 488 is included. So 4 in units place: 9 times, 8 in units place: 9 times.\n\nSo for hundreds digit 4, units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo adding up units place across all hundreds:\n\n- 4 appears 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39 times.\n- 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but in hundreds digit 4, units place, 4 appears 9 times, so total for 4 in units is 39, same as 8.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 4 in units 10 times, 8 in units 10 times.\n\n200-299: same, 10 each.\n\n300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n400-488: 4 in units 9 times, 8 in units 9 times.\n\nSo total units for 4: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits for 8: same, 39.\n\nSo now, adding up all the places for 4 and 8.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39. So total three-digit: 89+40+39=168.\n\nWait, no, wait: I think I made a mistake here. Wait, in the three-digit numbers, I already considered each place separately. So the hundreds, tens, and units for three-digit numbers are separate. So the total for 4 is:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nSo total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSimilarly, for 8:\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought the tens place for 8 in three-digit numbers was 39, and units place 39, so total 39+39=78, plus hundreds place 0, so 78.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the three-digit tens place, I had:\n\nFor 4 in tens place: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40.\n\nFor 8 in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8 in three-digit numbers: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo total 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, adding the single-digit and two-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 168. So total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8: single-digit 1, two-digit 19, three-digit 78. So total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488). That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds=1: 140-149, 10 times for 4.\n- Hundreds=2: 240-249, 10 times for 4.\n- Hundreds=3: 340-349, 10 times for 4.\n- Hundreds=4: 440-449, 10 times for 4.\nSo total 4's in tens place: 10*4=40.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in tens place:\n\n- Hundreds=1: 180-189, 10 times.\n- Hundreds=2: 280-289, 10 times.\n- Hundreds=3: 380-389, 10 times.\n- Hundreds=4: 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages.\nSo total 8's in tens place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nIn the units place for three-digit numbers:\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Hundreds=1: 104,114,...,194: 10 times.\n- Hundreds=2: 204,214,...,294: 10 times.\n- Hundreds=3: 304,314,...,394: 10 times.\n- Hundreds=4: 404,414,...,484: but wait, 488 is the last page, so from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10. So for 4 in units place, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 400-488, that's 89 pages. The units digit cycles 0-9 every 10, so 89 / 10 = 8 full cycles (80 pages) and 9 remaining pages (480-488). In each full cycle, 4 appears once in the units place, so 8 times. In the remaining 9 pages (480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once more. So total 4's in units place for hundreds=4: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo total 4's in units place: 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 9 (hundreds=4) = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place:\n\n- Hundreds=1: 108,118,...,198: 10 times.\n- Hundreds=2: 208,218,...,298: 10 times.\n- Hundreds=3: 308,318,...,398: 10 times.\n- Hundreds=4: 408,418,...,488: 9 times, since 488 is included, so from 408 to 488, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 pages, but let's see: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times.\n\nSo total 8's in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo now, adding up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39. So 89+40+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39. So 0+39+39=78.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me just verify once more.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit for 4 is 89 times, which is correct because 488 - 400 +1=89.\n\nIn the tens place for 4: 40 times, as calculated.\n\nIn the units place for 4: 39 times.\n\nSo 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 in three-digit for 4.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, 19 times for 4, and single-digit 1, so total 188.\n\nFor 8's, hundreds=0, tens=39, units=39, plus single and two-digit 19, so 78.\n\nDifference is 188-78=110? Wait, wait, no, 188-98=90. Wait, no, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, no, 188-98=90. Yes, because 100-98=2, so 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 188-98=90, but in my initial calculation, I thought 188-98=90, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check again: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, I think it's 48 complete groups, and then an extra 8 numbers. So, in each of those 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, which gives 48 times 1, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40 to 49 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then an extra 88 numbers. \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there are 10 numbers with a 4 in the tens place. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so 440 to 449 is within 401-488. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 80 to 89 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. In the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 489. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so 1 more. Total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in tens place, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 40+10=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in units, so 1 more. Total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in tens place, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding how digits are distributed in page numbers. Page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit numbers. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go up to 488, which is a 3-digit number. So, I'll need to consider all three-digit numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I'll sum them up across all places and find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the units place. In the units digit, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1, which is 48 for 4's and 48 for 8's. Now, the partial block from 481 to 488: the units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. \n\nSo, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49. Similarly, the total number of 8's is also 48 + 1 = 49. So, the units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's, each having 49 occurrences.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, actually, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, from 101 to 200, the tens digit cycles again, and so on. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, let's calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. \n\nFirst, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred, 140-149 in the second, etc.), so that's 10 times per hundred. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place each hundred.\n\nSo, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 40 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the partial hundred from 401-488. Let's see, the tens digit in this range is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, 5 for 451-460, 6 for 461-470, 7 for 471-480, and 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the 8 in the tens place is only up to 488, which is 481-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place in 401-488? It's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nHow about 8? It's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, each digit is for a full 10 numbers, except the last partial set if any. So, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for 4, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8, it's 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Therefore, 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, the total for 4's is 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50. For 8's, it's 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from partial) = 48.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times, except for 8, which only goes up to 488, so it's 8 times instead of 10. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times, and for 8, it's 8 times. So, adding to the complete hundreds, 4's have 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's have 40 + 8 = 48. So, in the tens place, 4's occur 50 times and 8's occur 48 times.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8, each for 10 numbers except the last one which is only 8 numbers. So, for each digit from 0 to 8, except 8, it's 10 numbers. But wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 numbers. So, 88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so 8 complete tens and a partial. Wait, no, because 401-410 is the first ten, 411-420 is the next, etc., up to 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the last ten is only 8 numbers. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, except 8, which is only 8 numbers.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- Tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- Tens digit 1: 411-420 (10)\n- Tens digit 2: 421-430 (10)\n- Tens digit 3: 431-440 (10)\n- Tens digit 4: 441-450 (10)\n- Tens digit 5: 451-460 (10)\n- Tens digit 6: 461-470 (10)\n- Tens digit 7: 471-480 (10)\n- Tens digit 8: 481-490, but only up to 488, so 8 numbers.\n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times (441-450). For 8 in the tens place, it's 8 times (481-488). So, adding to the complete hundreds:\n\n- 4's in tens: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's in tens: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 numbers, but in this case, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. How about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49+48 is 97, yes. So, total 4's are 188, and 8's are 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 seems high for 4's. Let me go through each step again.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8. Then, the last partial block of 8 numbers (481-488) has one 4 and one 8 in units place. So, units place 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's:48 +1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40 for both 4's and 8's. Then, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (441-450), and 8 occurs 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+8=48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 occurs 89 times (400-488), 8 occurs 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I feel like 91 might be too high. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Let me think again: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nWait, but when I add up, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens)=97.\n\nSo, 188-97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can think of another way to count, just to verify.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, so 48, plus if the last partial cycle has a 4, which it does (484 is the last 4 in units place before 488, but actually, in 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full cycles, each contributing 1, plus the last partial cycle has an 8 (488), so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in tens place: For each hundred, 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in the partial hundred 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place: 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40. In the partial hundred, 481-490 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers (481-488), so 8 more. Total 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears from 400-488: 89 times.\n\n8 does not appear in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor units digit, as before, 488 numbers.\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10)=48 full cycles, each contributing 1, plus if the remainder is >=4, add 1. 488 mod 10=8, which is >=4, so 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus if remainder >=8, add 1. 8>=8, so 48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remainder is 88 numbers. In the tens place, the number of times 4 appears is determined by how many full tens are in 88. Each ten contributes 1 occurrence of the digit in the tens place. Wait, no, actually, each full hundred contributes 10 times per digit, but in the partial hundred, the number of times the tens digit is 4 is equal to the number of complete tens in the partial hundred.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way: the number of times a specific digit appears in the tens place is equal to the number of times that digit appears in each block of 100, which is 10 times per hundred. So, for 488 numbers, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is:\n\nNumber of hundreds = floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's when the tens digit is 4, which is from 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, total 40+10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of hundreds=4, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 8 numbers. So, 40+8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in hundreds place: floor(488/1000)=0 full thousands, but since we're dealing with hundreds, it's when the hundreds digit is 4, which is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears in hundreds place: zero, because 488<800.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nI think this confirms the earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears in a range of numbers, I can break it down by each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place separately, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. But since we're starting from 1, maybe I should adjust for that. Wait, actually, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there in 488?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete cycles and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete cycle, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Similarly, the number of 8's would be 48 plus any extra 8's in the remaining numbers.\n\nWait, let me check that. The remaining 8 numbers after 48 complete cycles would be from 481 to 488. So, in the units place, the digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nHmm, okay, so the difference in the units place is zero. Now, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. But again, since we're going up to 488, I need to adjust.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many complete hundreds there are. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, but since 488 is less than 500, we have 8 full tens (40-49, 50-59, ..., 80-89, 90-99) but only up to 88. Wait, no, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but we only go up to 488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, but for the last tens group (80-89), only 8 numbers are present (481-488). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me clarify: from 401 to 488, the tens digit is as follows:\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- ...\n- 481-490: tens digit 8\n\nBut since we're stopping at 488, the last group is only 8 numbers (481-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times in the remaining 88 pages, whereas the other tens digits (0-7) each appear 10 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place in the remaining 88 pages:\n- The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the group 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the group 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 times.\n\nWait, no, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits are 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, for the tens place in the remaining 88 pages:\n- Number of 4's: 10 (from 440-449)\n- Number of 8's: 8 (from 480-488)\n\nSo, adding this to the complete hundreds:\n- Total 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 48 8's, making a difference of 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, the number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 10 (from 440-449), and 8 appears 8 times (from 480-488). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book has 488 pages. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers), so no 4's or 8's here.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so the digit 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive). Wait, actually, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so 89 times.\n\nAs for the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- From 1 to 488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8, and then in the remaining 8 numbers, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n- Complete hundreds: 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - Tens digits: 0-8, each appearing 10 times except 8, which appears 8 times.\n  - So, 4's in tens place: 10 (from 440-449)\n  - 8's in tens place: 8 (from 480-488)\n- So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's in hundreds place.\n- 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89= 188\nTotal 8's:49 +48 +0=97\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place? Let me check: from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the hundreds place differently. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so yes, 89 times. So, that seems right.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, from 1-9: 9 numbers, 1 digit each: 9 digits.\nFrom 10-99: 90 numbers, 2 digits each: 180 digits.\nFrom 100-488: 389 numbers, 3 digits each: 1167 digits.\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's: 188, total 8's:97. So, total digits accounted for by 4's and 8's: 188 +97=285. But total digits are 1356, so that leaves 1356 -285=1071 digits for other numbers. That seems plausible, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can recount the tens place for 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, in the tens place, from 1-488:\n\n- For 4's: in each hundred, 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 hundreds would be 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: in each hundred, 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds would be 40, plus in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times? Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489). But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nWait, let's list them: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. So, earlier I thought it was 8 times, but it's actually 9 times. So, that changes the count.\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n- 4's: 10 times (440-449)\n- 8's:9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50\nTotal 8's in tens place:40 +9=49\n\nSo, now, the total 8's in tens place is 49, not 48 as I previously thought.\n\nWait, so that changes the total counts.\n\nSo, recalculating:\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so I had an error in the tens place for 8's. Earlier, I thought it was 8 times, but it's actually 9 times because from 480-488, there are 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, the total 8's in tens place is 40 (from complete hundreds) +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98\n\nTotal 4's:49 +50 +89=188\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so the difference is 90 now, which is different from my initial 91. So, I must have made a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place earlier.\n\nWait, let me confirm again: from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8's are 40 (from 1-400) +9=49.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the correct total for 8's is 98, and 4's is 188, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 8 times, but now it's 9 times. Let me list the numbers from 480 to 488:\n\n480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nTherefore, the correct difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm still not entirely confident. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 mod 10=8, the last partial cycle has 8 numbers, which include 4 once (at 484). So, total 4's in units place:48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place:48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and 88 extra numbers (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds:4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-489). But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:40 +10=50\nTotal 8's in tens place:40 +9=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 100-399: hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (400-488 inclusive).\n8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n- In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, so in 4 complete hundreds (1-400), 4 and 8 each appear 40 times.\n- In the remaining 88 pages (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), while 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89\n- Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Because the book has 488 pages, so the last page is 488. That means the page numbers go from 001 to 488, but wait, actually, page 1 is just 1, not 001. So maybe I should think of them as one, two, or three-digit numbers depending on their value.\n\nWait, but to count the number of 4's and 8's, maybe it's easier to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the units place. How many times does the digit 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete blocks of 10 is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we take the integer part, which is 48. Each of these 48 blocks contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So actually, it's 48 + 1 = 49 times that 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place, each block of 10 contributes one 8. So 48 blocks would give 48 eights, and in the last partial block, 488 is included, which is another 8. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, that's interesting. So the difference here is zero so far.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 00 to 99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place in each block of 100.\n\nNow, the total number of pages is 488, so there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 pages in the 400-488 range. Let's calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8. So does 4 appear in the tens place here? Yes, in 440-449. That's another 10 times. So total 4's in the tens place would be 4 * 10 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 9 times. So total 8's in the tens place would be 4 * 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear here? The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So that's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, wait. Actually, each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4. So how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book because the book has 488 pages. So 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place.\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49, difference = 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49, difference = +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0, difference = +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so that would mean there are 90 more 4's than 8's in all the page numbers. Hmm, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For 4's: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is included, so that's one more. So 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 48 full tens, each contributing 1, and in the last 8 numbers, 488 is included, so 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488). So 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's: From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4. So 89. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: There are no pages with hundreds digit 8, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up the differences:\n\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal: 90.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to approach this is to calculate the total number of 4's and the total number of 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating total 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nCalculating total 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that confirms it. So the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades (480 numbers) contributing 48 instances, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, occur once every 10 numbers, totaling 49.\n   - **Difference:** 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 instances. Four hundreds give 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Each hundred contributes 10 instances. Four hundreds give 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n   - **Difference:** 50 - 49 = +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, 89 instances.\n   - **8's:** No instances.\n   - **Difference:** 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n**Total Difference:** 0 (units) + 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nThe total number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. The digits cycle every 10 numbers, so in every block of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. Specifically, in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, and 340-349. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so 0 isn't used. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me think. For the tens digit being 4, it occurs in each hundred block once. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one block, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10. Then 240-249, and 340-349. So that's four blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred block is 400-488. Does that affect the count? Let me check. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? So yes, that's included in the 340-349 block? Wait, no, 340-349 is in the 300s, and 440-449 is in the 400s. So actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10. But earlier, I thought of four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each contributing 10. So that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. But in the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10. So that would make it 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so I think I might have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for each hundreds block, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear?\n\nIn the 0-99 block (pages 1-99), the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 times.\n\nIn the 100-199 block, it's 140-149, another 10.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 240-249, 10.\n\n300-399: 340-349, 10.\n\n400-488: 440-449, 10.\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so does that affect the count? From 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So total 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first page with 4 in the hundreds place, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48\n\nTens place: 50\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. Okay.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full block, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once (in 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds digit can be 0,1,2,3, or 4. So, let's see:\n\nIn 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers.\n\nIn 100-199: 180-189, another 10.\n\nIn 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n\nIn 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n\nIn 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in the 400s occurs from 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n0-99: 10\n\n100-199: 10\n\n200-299: 10\n\n300-399: 10\n\n400-488: 9\n\nTotal tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that: 10 four times is 40, plus 9 is 49. Okay.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from page 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\n\nTens place: 49\n\nHundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me confirm that addition: 49 + 49 is 98. Correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nUnits: 48 (since 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in units place, plus in 481-488, no 4 in units place).\n\nTens: 50 (as I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449).\n\nHundreds: 89 (from 400-488, which is 89 numbers).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 49 (48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488).\n\nTens: 49 (as I had 10 in each of the first four hundreds, and 9 in the last partial hundred).\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. In the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, in the 400s, it's 9, not 10. So, the total tens place 8's are 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nI think I've accounted for all the digits correctly. So, the final answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between these two counts.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the structure of the page numbers. Page numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit, from 10 to 99 are two-digit, and from 100 to 488 are three-digit. So, I'll need to handle each of these ranges separately for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the digit 4. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units place, tens place, and hundreds place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. In each full block, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481 to 488), does 4 appear in the units place? Yes, 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial block, from 401 to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. The first block is 1-100, which includes 40-49, that's 10 times. The next block is 101-200, which includes 140-149, another 10. Then 201-300 includes 240-249, 10 more. Then 301-400 includes 340-349, another 10. So that's 4 blocks, 10 each, totaling 40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, yes, 40 + 10 = 50 for the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's are units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, units place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, 484 is the only one, so 49 total. That seems right.\n\nTens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is another 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to 4, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 times, plus in the last partial block (481-488), 488 is included, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: For every block of 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. The tens digit 8 in 401-488 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's are 0.\n\nSo, total 8's are units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 50\nHundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place: 49\nHundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but wait, I'm a bit concerned because I remember sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and units places, there might be overlaps or miscounts, but I think I handled each place separately correctly.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place for 4 again. From 1-400, we have 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 1-400, 4 blocks contributing 10 each, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for both digits: 49 each, which is correct because each digit appears once every 10 numbers, and there are 48 full decades plus one partial decade, each contributing 1, so 49.\n\nSo, yes, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, in the hundreds place for 4's, it's from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. For example, in the number 444, the digit 4 appears three times, so each occurrence is counted in units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, 488 has two 8's, but in our count, each digit is counted separately, so that's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by examining each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and summing the occurrences. Similarly, the same process is applied to the digit 8. The difference between the counts of 4's and 8's gives the result.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** 49 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, plus one in the last partial block).\n   - **Tens Place:** 50 occurrences (10 per 100 blocks, plus 10 in the last partial block).\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 89 occurrences (all numbers from 400 to 488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** 49 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, plus one in the last partial block).\n   - **Tens Place:** 49 occurrences (10 per 100 blocks, plus 9 in the last partial block).\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 0 occurrences (no page numbers reach 800).\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, and each digit in these numbers can be a 4 or an 8. I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two counts to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the positions of the digits in the page numbers. Since 488 is a three-digit number, I can think of each page number as a three-digit number by padding with leading zeros if necessary. So, page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, and so on up to page 488, which is 488. This way, I can analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\nI'll need to count the number of 4's and 8's in each of the three digit places (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 001 to 488. Let's tackle each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like in 004, 014, etc.) and the digit 8 appears once (like in 008, 018, etc.). Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. Now, for the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding that to our count, we have 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. Wait, that can't be right because the problem is asking for how many more 4's than 8's, so maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, from 1 to 488, each page is numbered from 1 to 488, so when considering the units digit, from 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear? Let me think again.\n\nEach digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in the units place for every block of 10 numbers. So, for 488 numbers, how many complete tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete tens and 8 extra numbers.\n\nIn each complete ten, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so each digit appears once. So, in 48 complete tens, each digit appears 48 times. But wait, page numbers start at 1, so page 1 is 001, page 2 is 002, etc., up to page 488. So, actually, when considering page numbers as three-digit numbers from 001 to 488, the units digit does indeed cycle through 0-9 for each ten.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each complete ten) plus 1 (from the last partial ten where the units digit reaches 4 again at 484). Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 plus 1 (at 488). So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 000-099, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each (for each hundred). But since our book goes up to 488, let's see how many hundreds we have.\n\nFrom 000 to 399, that's four hundreds (0, 1, 2, 3), each contributing 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, up to 399, the tens digit for 4 would have appeared 4*10=40 times, and similarly for 8, 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, from 400 to 488, the tens digit is in the range 0 to 8. Let's break this down. From 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). Each of these tens digits appears 9 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 9 times as well (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, from 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, etc., up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last tens digit (8) appears only 9 times (480-488).\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 9 times except for 0, which appears 10 times because 400-409 is 10 numbers. Wait, no, 400-409 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times, then 1 appears 10 times (410-419), up to 8, which appears 9 times (480-488). So, in the tens place from 400-488, 4 appears once as the tens digit in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, no, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, so let's recalculate. From 000 to 399, the tens digit for 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times, and similarly for 8, 40 times. Now, from 400 to 488, the tens digit for 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449), and for 8, it appears 9 times (in 480-488). So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and eights: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. From 000 to 399, each tens digit from 0-9 appears exactly 40 times (since 4 hundreds, each with 10 times per digit). So, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear?\n\n- Tens digit 0: 400-409, which is 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 1: 410-419, 10 numbers.\n- ...\n- Tens digit 7: 470-479, 10 numbers.\n- Tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, it appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place from 400-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (as tens digit in 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (as tens digit in 480-488).\n\nTherefore, total fours in tens place: 40 (from 0-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 40 (from 0-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49.\n\nSo, the tens place contributes 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is a bit trickier. From 000 to 399, the hundreds digit cycles through 0, 1, 2, 3. Each of these appears 100 times (from 000-099, 100-199, etc.), but since we're starting at 1, maybe it's slightly different. Wait, in our case, the page numbers are from 001 to 488, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Hundreds digit 0: pages 1-99, which is 99 numbers, but since we're considering 001-099, the hundreds digit is 0 for 99 numbers. Wait, but in three-digit numbers, 000-099 would have hundreds digit 0 for 100 numbers, but since we start at 001, it's 99 numbers. Hmm, but I think for the sake of counting digits, it's better to consider all three-digit numbers from 000 to 488, so the hundreds digit 0 appears 100 times (000-099), but since our book starts at 001, it's 99 times. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe it's easier to think of the hundreds digit as 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the hundreds digit for each range:\n\n- From 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's in the hundreds place.\n- From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n- From 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same thing.\n- From 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, same.\n- From 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (since 400-488 is 89 numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, does the hundreds digit ever have an 8? No, because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds digit 8 never appears.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, the number of 4's is 89, and the number of 8's is 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, total 4's = units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89.\n\nLet me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal 8's = units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 of each, so 48*1=48 fours and 48 eights.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 0-399: 40 fours, 40 eights.\n- From 400-488: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 fours, 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\n- 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n- 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with hundreds digit 4, so that's 89 fours. That seems right. And since the book doesn't go beyond 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8, so no 8's there.\n\nIn the tens place, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, as calculated, 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nSo, yes, the total 4's are 188, and 8's are 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in the 400-488 range. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 400-488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\n- 400-409: tens digit 0, 10 numbers\n- 410-419: tens digit 1, 10 numbers\n- 420-429: tens digit 2, 10 numbers\n- 430-439: tens digit 3, 10 numbers\n- 440-449: tens digit 4, 10 numbers\n- 450-459: tens digit 5, 10 numbers\n- 460-469: tens digit 6, 10 numbers\n- 470-479: tens digit 7, 10 numbers\n- 480-488: tens digit 8, 9 numbers\n\nSo, yes, tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the total counts are accurate, and the difference is indeed 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit '4' appears 188 times and '8' appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Each page number is a number from 1 to 488, so I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding how digits are counted in numbers. I remember that when dealing with digits in numbers, it's often helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, etc. So, for page numbers from 1 to 488, I should check each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) for both 4 and 8 and count their occurrences.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (the first digit from the right):** In every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, every 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's at 4; in 11-20, it's at 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\n   Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\n2. **Tens place (the second digit from the right):** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of these 4 hundreds, there's a block where the tens digit is 4, each contributing 10 4's. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place.\n\n   Now, looking at the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 numbers, so another 10 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that adds 10 more. So total 4's in the tens place would be 40 (from the first 400 pages) plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50.\n\nWait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here. Because 401-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit in 401-488 goes up to 8 in the tens place (since 488 is the last page). So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, but the 4 in the tens place occurs only in 440-449. So, yes, that's 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place (the third digit from the right):** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's printed are 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:** Just like with 4's, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 8's. Now, the last partial block is 481-488, where the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (at 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in blocks of 100. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\n   Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\n   Wait, but actually, the tens digit being 8 occurs from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place from the last partial hundred.\n\n   Therefore, total 8's in tens place: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nSo, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. So, units place: 48 full blocks give 48, and the last partial block (481-488) adds 1 more, so 49. Tens place: 4 full hundreds give 40, and the last partial hundred (401-488) gives 9, so 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I got 187, and 8's are 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the 8's tens place. Let me recount the 8's in the tens place.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place from there. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each giving 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so 1 more, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nFor 4's, let's check again:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each giving 1, so 48, and in 481-488, units digit 4 doesn't appear, so 48.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each giving 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nSo, 187 4's and 98 8's. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes.\n\nSo, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8.

So, in every set of 10 consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place.

Each full group contributes one 4, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial group (481-488), I check if there's a 4 in the units place. The numbers are 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The 4 in the units place is at 484, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these ranges has 10 consecutive numbers where the tens digit is 4. To find how many such ranges are there up to 488, I can divide 488 by 100, which gives 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds plus the 400-488 range. Let me correct that: from 0-99, there's 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299 has 240-249, and 300-399 has 340-349. Now, 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, ..., up to 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and there are 4 full hundreds (0-399) plus the 400-488 range, which also has 10 numbers (440-449). So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so does the 400-488 range include 440-449? Yes, because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's 5 sets, each with 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. But wait, 488 is less than 500, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 full tens (48 \u00d7 1) = 48, plus one more in 484, so 49. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the digit 8:\n\nI'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges are there up to 488. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, each of the first four hundreds contributes 10, and the last partial hundred contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's 9. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800 onwards, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the tens place again. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Units place: 48 full groups plus 1 in 488, so 49. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full times, and then in the 481-488 range, the units digits go up to 8, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, as we calculated, it's 49. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that the 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Then, the tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place: 49. So, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0, so 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's: From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's 9. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 in the tens place. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the tens place again. I had 5 sets of 10, so 50. But let me see: from 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 188, 8's: 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the hundreds place, 4's go up to 488, which is 89 numbers, but 8's don't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, that's a big difference right there.\n\nWait, let me confirm the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check that again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: every 10 numbers, so 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, which is 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears at 488, so that's one more, making it 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 5 sets of 10, so 50.\n\nTens place for 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 0-399) and 9 in 400-488, so 49.\n\nHundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place and sum them up.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: floor(488/10) = 48, plus 1 if the last number in the units place is >=4. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so 48 +1 =49.\n\n- Tens: floor(488/100) =4, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the remaining 88 numbers (400-488) have how many 4's in the tens place? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4\u00d710 +10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: floor((488 - 399)/100) = floor(89/100)=0? Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if 488 mod10 >=8, which it is (8>=8), so 48+1=49.\n\n- Tens: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0, since 800>488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, pages 1-9 are single-digit, 10-99 are two-digit, and 100-488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, actually, page 1 is just 1, and page 10 is two digits, so up to page 99, and then from 100 onwards, it's three digits. So maybe I should split this problem into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers and count the number of 4's and 8's in each position separately.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I can calculate how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, in the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. In each set, 4 appears once in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers. The units digit here goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, from 1 to 480, it's also 48 times, and from 481 to 488, 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 1 to 480, it's 48 sets of 10, so 48 times for 8's as well. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once. So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 4's = 48, 8's = 49. So, 4's are 1 less than 8's here.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 for 10-99. So, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred.\n\nBut wait, our book goes up to 488, so let's see how many hundreds we have. There are 4 hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, not a full hundred. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. In each full hundred, like 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 140-149. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, and so on up to 300-399, which would be 340-349. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So, for three full hundreds (100-399), that's 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nNow, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 only once for 10 numbers: 440-449. So, yes, that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place. In each full hundred, like 100-199, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 180-189. Similarly, in 200-299: 280-289, and in 300-399: 380-389. Each contributes 10 times. So, three full hundreds give 3 * 10 = 30 times.\n\nNow, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers here. So, total 8's in the tens place: 30 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's = 40, 8's = 39. So, 4's are 1 more than 8's here.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. For the hundreds digit, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the hundreds place for 100 numbers each, except for the last one, which might be less.\n\nWait, actually, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, each hundreds digit from 1 to 3 appears exactly 100 times, and 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n\nSo, for 4's in the hundreds place: only in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would be 8 in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 40\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 48 + 40 + 89 = 177\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 177, and the number of 8's is 88. The difference is 177 - 88 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so no extra 4's. So, units place: 48.\n\nFor 8's in units place: same logic, 48 times from 1-480, and then 488 has an 8, so 49 times total. So, that's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFor 4's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers)\n200-299: 240-249 (10)\n300-399: 340-349 (10)\n400-488: 440-449 (10)\nTotal: 4 * 10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 40 times.\n\nFor 8's in tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8: 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 3 * 10 = 30.\n\nThen, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times.\n\n8's: 800-899 would be hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes to 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 177\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\nDifference: 177 - 88 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the ranges:**\n   - Pages 1-9: Single-digit\n   - Pages 10-99: Two-digit\n   - Pages 100-488: Three-digit\n\n2. **Count occurrences of each digit in each position (units, tens, hundreds):**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. No additional '4's in 481-488.\n     - Total '4's in units: 48\n     - '8' appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 from 1-480, plus once in 488.\n     - Total '8's in units: 49\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred has 10 numbers with '4' in the tens place. For 100-399, that's 3*10=30. In 400-488, 440-449 adds 10.\n     - Total '4's in tens: 40\n     - Similarly, '8's in tens place: 3*10=30 from 100-399, plus 9 from 480-488.\n     - Total '8's in tens: 39\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n     - Total '4's in hundreds: 89\n     - Total '8's in hundreds: 0\n\n3. **Sum the totals:**\n   - Total '4's: 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 177\n   - Total '8's: 49 (units) + 39 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 88\n\n4. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - 177 (total '4's) - 88 (total '8's) = 89\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 89 more times than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{89}"

Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, I'll need to analyze each place for both the digit 4 and the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4, I'll check how many times it appears in the units place, then in the tens place, and finally in the hundreds place. I'll do the same for the digit 8 and then compare the totals.\n\nLet's start with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So from 1 to 10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). This pattern repeats every 10 pages. Now, since the book has 488 pages, I can divide 488 by 10 to find out how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 times each. But wait, there's a remainder of 8 pages after 48 groups (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). So in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), I need to check how many 4's and 8's are in the units place. Looking at 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once at 484, and 8 appears once at 488. Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's check the tens place. For the tens digit, the digit changes every 100 pages. Each block of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 (10 numbers), and 8 for 80-89 (10 numbers). Now, since the book has 488 pages, which is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times as well. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times for 4 and 4*10=40 times for 8. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). So in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. Therefore, total in tens place: 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So 4 is ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIn the units place:\n- 488 pages, so 48 full tens and 8 extra. Each full ten contributes 1 four and 1 eight. So 48 each. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So total units: 48+1=49 for both, correct.\n\nIn the tens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights. 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n- Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), tens digit cycles 0-8. So, 40-49 is 10 fours, and 80-88 is 9 eights. So total tens: 40+10=50 fours, 40+9=49 eights. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n- 400-488 is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+49+0=98 for 8's. Difference is 90. Seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? So, from page 1 to page 488, we have numbers from 1 up to 488. \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each place for both digits 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 pages, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and then in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once more on page 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is actually the number of times 4 is in 0-9, 10-19, ..., 480-488. Each set of 10 has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 0 to 488, that's 489 numbers, but page numbers start at 1, so 488 pages. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 times (since 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets) plus one more in the 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems right.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nLet's see: The first block is 40-49 (10 pages), then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is before 488, so yes, that's fine. So, 50 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 0-99, the tens digit 4 occurs once (40-49). From 100-199, it occurs once (140-149). Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, 300-399: 340-349, and 400-488: 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. Okay, that seems correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 occurrences of the digit 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 pages in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial set, 480-488, the units digit 8 appears once on page 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Page 488 is the last page, so units digit 8 appears on pages 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many times is that? Let me think: from 0-488, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=8. Wait, 488 mod 10 is 8, so yes, we add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that's correct.\n\n2. Tens place: Now, for the tens digit 8. This occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n100-199: 180-189 (10)\n200-299: 280-289 (10)\n300-399: 380-389 (10)\n400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the end)\n\nSo, that's five blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit 8 would appear from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8. When I considered 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, so total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The question is, how many more 4's are there than 8's? So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, each of those 89 numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, I had five blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems right.\n\nFor the units place of 4's, I had 48 full decades and one more in 484, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, correct. Tens place: four blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 4's or 8's in other places. For example, in the hundreds place for 8's, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place for 8's again. When I have 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 occurrences. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me think about the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 8,18,28,...,488. The last term is 488, so ((488-8)/10)+1=(480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can think of another way to calculate this. Alternatively, I can think about each digit place separately and count the number of times each digit appears.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\n- For 4's: As calculated, 49 times.\n- For 8's: 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: 50 times (five blocks of 10).\n- For 8's: 49 times (four blocks of 10 and one block of 9).\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- For 4's:89 times.\n- For 8's:0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:49+50+89=188\n8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't overcount in the hundreds place. For example, when counting the hundreds place, I considered all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 4's, I had five blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5\u00d710=50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had four full blocks of 10 and one partial block of 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nUnits place for both digits is 49 each.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Occurs once every 10 pages.  \n   - Total occurrences: 48 full sets of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 (page 484) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Occurs in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.  \n   - Total blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).  \n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences.  \n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - Occurs from 400-488.  \n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.  \n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**  \n   - Occurs once every 10 pages.  \n   - Total occurrences: 48 full sets of 10 (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 (page 488) = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**  \n   - Occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.  \n   - Total blocks: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block (480-488).  \n   - Full blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.  \n   - Partial block contributes 9 (480-488).  \n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**  \n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.  \n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**  \n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the complete sets. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each hundred, there's a block of 10 where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there? 488 is less than 500, so there are 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 88 pages in 400-488. \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 x 10 = 40 fours in the tens place. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 480-488. Wait, actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. So, that's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours would be 4 x 10 (from 0-399) plus 10 from 440-449, making it 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 499, so the 440-449 block is fully included, right? So, that's correct, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me recount. From 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, 240-249, 10. In 300-399, 340-349, 10. And in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 times 10 (from 0-399) plus 10 in 400-488, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. So that seems correct.\n\nUnits place: 48 fours, as calculated earlier. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 fours. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: In every set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Plus, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers long, except possibly the last one.\n\nFrom 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10. 100-199: 180-189 is 10. 200-299: 280-289 is 10. 300-399: 380-389 is 10. 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as calculated, 49 eights. So total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in the tens place it was 49, so 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights. That seems correct.\n\nNow, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place: 48 fours.\n\nTens place: 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nHundreds: 0\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nTherefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I counted correctly in the tens place for 4's. From 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, 140-149, 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. And in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 fours in the tens place. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers where the hundreds digit is 4. So, 89 fours.\n\nUnits place: Every 10 numbers have one 4, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 fours, plus in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, 48 fours in the units place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 fours.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 49\n\nTens: 49\n\nTotal: 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Counting the number of '4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit '4' appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 (488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 fours.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) does not include a '4' in the units place.\n   - **Total in units place:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - **Total in tens place:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total number of '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of '8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to '4's, in every set of ten, '8' appears once in the units place.\n   - 48 complete sets contribute 48 eights.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes an '8' in the units place (488).\n   - **Total in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - '8' appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each block contributes 10 eights, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers in the 800s, so no '8's in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total number of '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of '4's: 187\n- Number of '8's: 98\n- **Difference:** 187 - 98 = **89**\n\n**Answer:** There are \\boxed{89} more '4's printed than '8's."

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me think about how to count the digits. I remember that in problems like this, it's helpful to consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. So I'll need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each of these positions across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 more numbers (from 481 to 488). So, in each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. Therefore, in 48 blocks, the units digit 4 appears 48 times, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, the total count for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8 it's 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means there's no difference here; they're equal in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9) and then each digit from 1 to 9 ten times each (for 10-99). Wait, actually, for 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so maybe I should adjust my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of each hundred as having 10 sets of 10 numbers where the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the tens digit, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4*10 = 40 times for 4. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10 = 40 times for 8.\n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes through each digit from 0 to 8 in the tens place. Wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers. Let me think: 401-410: tens digit is 0; 411-420: tens digit is 1; 421-430: tens digit is 2; 431-440: tens digit is 3; 441-450: tens digit is 4; 451-460: tens digit is 5; 461-470: tens digit is 6; 471-480: tens digit is 7; and 481-488: tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, in the tens place, from 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in this last partial hundred?\n\nWell, from 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. Wait, no, 480 is included in the previous hundred (401-500?), no, wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 480 is part of 401-488, right? Wait, no, 401-488 is 88 numbers, so 480 is within that range. Wait, but 480 is actually 480, so 480 is included in 401-488, which is correct.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: The range 401-488 includes 88 numbers. So, 401 to 488 is 88 pages. So, the tens digit for 401-488 cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8\n\nSo, for each of these, except the last one, there are 10 numbers. The last one, 481-488, is only 8 numbers. So, in the tens place:\n\n- For 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0\n- 411-420: 10 numbers, tens digit 1\n- 421-430: 10 numbers, tens digit 2\n- 431-440: 10 numbers, tens digit 3\n- 441-450: 10 numbers, tens digit 4\n- 451-460: 10 numbers, tens digit 5\n- 461-470: 10 numbers, tens digit 6\n- 471-480: 10 numbers, tens digit 7\n- 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8\n\nSo, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? It appears in 441-450, which is 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear? It appears in 481-488, which is 8 times.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, adding to the earlier counts from the complete hundreds:\n\n- Total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 401-488) = 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's in tens place: 4*10 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 401-488) = 40 + 8 = 48\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me check again. Wait, no, in the complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 appears 10 times per hundred, and 8 appears 10 times per hundred. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nThen, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total for 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, so in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 has 2 more in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the partial hundred. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, but since we're only counting page numbers, I think we can ignore leading zeros, so the hundreds digit only starts appearing from page 100 onwards.\n\nSo, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nNow for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That's correct.\n\nTens place: For each complete hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times per hundred. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 4's tens: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's tens: 40 + 8 = 48. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 8's hundreds: 0. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 188 - 97 is indeed 91. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount somewhere.\n\nWait, let me recount the hundreds place for 4. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, in the partial hundred, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place there. So, 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 = 48 for 8's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the partial hundred, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's in tens place.\n\nUnits place: both 4 and 8 have 49 each, so that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's 91. Let me see if there's another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position separately and then sum them up.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 488 pages. Each 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9. So, the number of complete cycles is 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8). So, 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 48 each.\n\nThen, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488). Let's break this down:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n\n8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n8's: 0 times, since the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49+48=97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nHmm, same result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. That's correct.\n\nWait, another way: 488 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nI think that's accurate.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 97. Therefore, there are 188 - 97 = 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When I was counting the units place, I considered 488 as the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, in the last partial block, units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once and 8 appears once. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 481-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those 8 numbers, so that's 8 times 8 in the tens place. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 484 is the only number in 481-488 where the units digit is 4, and 488 is where the units digit is 8.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Complete blocks: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8), contributing 48 each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4, contributing 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Page numbers go from 1 to 488, so each page is a number in that range. \n\nI remember that when dealing with digits in numbers, it's helpful to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds, and maybe even thousands, though 488 is less than 1000, so thousands place isn't needed here. So, I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's in each digit place.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 pages. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. So, in each 100-number block, there are 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nHow many full 100-number blocks are there in 488? That's 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full blocks, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 4's. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 1000 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, no, actually, page 1 is just 1, so the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, there are 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. As before, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages. Each full block contributes 1 8, so 48. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similar to the 4's, in each 100-number block, the tens digit cycles through 0-9. So, the 8 in the tens place occurs in 10 consecutive numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nThere are 4 full 100-number blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10 = 40. Now, the remaining 88 pages are 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. The 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 0 for 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place here because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 187, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, okay, so the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, so 440-449 is 10 pages, which adds 10 more. So, 40 +10=50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 8's, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the extra 8 in 488, so 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. The last 8 pages (481-488) don't include a 4 in the units place, so 48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: No, because the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, 187 - 98 = 89. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full blocks, contributing 48, and no additional 4's in the remaining 8 pages.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 contributes 10 4's. Four blocks contribute 40, and the last 88 pages add 10 more.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 contributes one 8. 48 blocks give 48, plus one in the last 8 pages.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 contributes 10 8's. Four blocks give 40, and the last 88 pages add 9 more.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because the occurrence of digits can vary depending on the place. Let me start with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 should appear equally often in each set of ten pages. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages. \n\nIn each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times 1, which is 48, and similarly, the number of 8's would also be 48. But wait, we have those extra 8 pages, which are 481 to 488. Let me check if any of those have a 4 or 8 in the units place. 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, in the units place, the total 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and the 8's are 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Hmm, so they're equal in the units place. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49), and similarly for 8. So, how many hundreds do we have in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds and then 88 pages. \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Now, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's look at the tens place here. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (in 401-410) to 8 (in 480-488). \n\nWait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which might be less. Let me think. From 401 to 410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 480-488, which is tens digit 8. So, for the tens digit 4, how many times does it appear in this partial hundred? It would be in 440-449, which is 10 times. Similarly, for 8, it's in 480-488, which is 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. \n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 each, the total for 4's in the tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8's, it's 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 49 eights. \n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 1-99, 2 for 100-199, 3 for 200-299, 4 for 300-399, and then 4 again for 400-488. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is 1 from 1-99, 2 from 100-199, 3 from 200-299, 4 from 300-399, and then 4 again from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 300-399, that's 100 pages, so 4 appears 100 times. Then from 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 4 appears another 89 times in the hundreds place. So, total 4's in hundreds place are 100 + 89 = 189. \n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 189 fours and 0 eights. \n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 189\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 189 = 288\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 288 - 98 = 190. \n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. \n\nFirst, units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the extra pages 481-488, which add one 4 and one 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. That's correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, so 40 each. Then, the remaining 88 pages: 440-449 is 10 fours, and 480-488 is 9 eights. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: 300-399 is 100 fours, and 400-488 is 89 fours, totaling 189. No 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 189 = 288 fours. 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 eights. So, 288 - 98 = 190. Hmm, that's the calculation. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place in the remaining 88 pages. Let me check that again. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and only appears 9 times because we stop at 488. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 10 times, and for 8, it's 9 times. That seems correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the calculation is right. Therefore, there are 190 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in the units place for complete tens (1-480).\n   - Pages 481-488 add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place for complete hundreds (1-400).\n   - Pages 401-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 100 times (300-399) and 89 times (400-488), totaling 189.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 189\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 189 (hundreds) = 288\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n288 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 190\n\n\\boxed{190}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So in each block, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 pages (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So for 48 blocks, that's 48 times 1 for 4's and 48 times 1 for 8's. Then, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nHmm, so in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. That means the difference comes from the tens and hundreds places.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. So for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, looking at the partial hundred from 401-488. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488. So, that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 times (480, 481, ..., 488). \n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages because 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place for the partial hundred, 4's appear 10 times and 8's appear 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4*10 is 40 for each, then adding 10 for 4's and 9 for 8's. So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, let me check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have 484 and 488, so 4's and 8's each appear once. So, units: 48 + 1 = 49 for both.\n\nTens place:\n- Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. 4 hundreds contribute 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear here.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages has one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages contain 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 pages.\n   - 48 full blocks contribute 48 each, and the partial block adds 1 each.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred has 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - 488 pages have 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n   - The partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI remember that to count the number of times a particular digit appears, I can look at each digit place separately\u2014units, tens, hundreds\u2014and calculate how many times the digit appears in each place. So, I should probably analyze the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place for both the digit 4 and the digit 8.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in every ten numbers, and so does the digit 8.\n\nNow, how many sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488).

Let's see: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 484 has a 4 in the units place, which is one more. So, total units place 4's would be 48 * 1 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place: in each set of ten, 8 appears once, so 48 times, and in the extra 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 as well. Wait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 1-9) to 9 (in 90-99). So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 numbers. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, it appears 10 times in every 100 numbers, and similarly for 8.\n\nNow, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 4 full hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 times for the digit 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, for the extra 88 pages (401-488), let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. The tens digit in this range is 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 481-488 is 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 441-450, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 441-450 is fully included, so that's 10 times. But wait, 441-450 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers (481-488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these 8 numbers. So, in the extra 88 pages, digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, adding up, the total number of times 4 appears in the tens place is 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 (from the extra) = 50. For 8, it's 40 (from full hundreds) + 8 (from extra) = 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times. The difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, for pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so we can ignore those. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The highest hundreds digit is 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let me sum up the differences from each place:\n\n- Units place: 0 difference (49 each)\n- Tens place: 2 more 4's\n- Hundreds place: 89 more 4's\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me double-check each place.\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 for 4 and 1 for 8, so 48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total: 48 +1=49 for 4, 48 +1=49 for 8. Correct, difference is 0.\n\nTens place: For 4, in the first 400 pages, 4 appears 4 times 10 (from each hundred) = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 441-450, which is 10 times. So, 40 +10=50. For 8, in the first 400, 4 times 10=40. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, 40 +8=48. So, 50-48=2. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89-0=89. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 0 +2 +89=91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAnd for 8, since the book ends at 488, there's no page 800-899, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, the total difference is 91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything else. Maybe I should consider if there are any overlaps or if I double-counted somewhere. But I think each place is considered separately, so units, tens, hundreds, and each is counted without overlap. So, I think 91 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets and 8 extra numbers.\n   - 4 appears 48 times in units place and once in 484, totaling 49.\n   - 8 appears 48 times and once in 488, totaling 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 appears 40 times in 400 pages and 10 times in 441-450, totaling 50.\n   - 8 appears 40 times and 8 times in 481-488, totaling 48.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = 2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times from 400-488.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = 89.\n\n**Total Difference:** 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number at most, right? So, pages 1 through 9 are single-digit, 10 to 99 are two-digit, and 100 to 488 are three-digit numbers.\n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll consider each place separately.\n\n1. Units place: For every group of 10 pages, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once. How many such sets are there up to page 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, page 488 is the last page, so after 48 sets (which go up to 480), there are 8 more pages (481 to 488). In these, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, every group of 100 pages has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Then from 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 488 is in the 400-488 range. So, for each hundred, there are 10 times 4 in the tens place. So that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 pages. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: For the hundreds digit, it's 4 only in the range 400-488. So how many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49+50 is 99, and 99+89 is 188. So there are 188 fours.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4, in each set of 10, 8 appears once. So up to page 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, in the remaining pages 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, every hundred has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So in each hundred, that's 10 times. There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so that's 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So the hundreds digit is never 8. So hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. There are 48 full sets of 10 pages (480 pages), contributing 48 fours. Pages 481-488 add one more 4 in 484. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred (e.g., 40-49). With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 fours. Pages 440-449 add 10 more. Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all pages 400-488, which is 89 times. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 48 in full sets, plus one in 488. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. With 4 full hundreds, that's 40 fours. Pages 480-488 add 9 more. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number, right? Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the page numbers are 1-digit (1-9), two-digit (10-99), and three-digit (100-488).\n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. The only one that matters here is page 4. So, that's one 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: these are from 10 to 99. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place and how many times it appears in the units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but 44 has two 4's, but since I'm counting each occurrence, I should count each digit separately. So, from 10-99, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 9 sets of 10 in two-digit numbers (10-99), so 9 times in the units place. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so does that mean I should count two 4's for that number? Wait, no, because I'm counting each digit occurrence. So, in the units place, from 10-99, the digit 4 appears 9 times (once in each ten's group), but wait, actually, from 10-99, there are 90 numbers, so 90/10 = 9 times in the units place. But wait, 40-49 is 10 numbers where 4 is in the tens place, but in the units place, it's 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, except 44, which contributes two 4's. Wait, no, 44 is just one occurrence in the units place for that number. Wait, no, 44 has a 4 in the tens and units place. So, when I'm counting the units place, 44 contributes one 4 in the units place, same as the others. So, the units place from 10-99: 9 times. So total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but 44 is counted in both tens and units. So, the total number of 4's in two-digit numbers is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. But wait, 44 is included in both counts, so the total 4's from two-digit numbers would be 19, but 44 contributes two 4's, so does that mean I'm double-counting? No, because when I count the tens place, I'm counting each occurrence of 4 in the tens place, and when I count the units place, I'm counting each occurrence in the units place. So, 44 is correctly counted as two 4's, one in each place. So, 10 in tens, 9 in units, total 19. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but only up to 488. So, pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. Pages 200-299: 2. Pages 300-399: 3. Pages 400-488: 4.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nStarting with hundreds place: Only pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, tens place: In three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, and the units digit can be 0-9. I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nLet's consider each hundred group:\n\n100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9, so for each ten's place, there are 10 numbers. So, for 4 in the tens place in 100-199: 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 340-349: 10 times.\n\n400-488: Now, here, the tens digit can go up to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 numbers. So, total for tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. 200-299: 240-249: 10. 300-399: 340-349:10. 400-488: 440-449:10. So, 10+10+10+10=40. So, 40 times 4 appears in the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, units place: Similarly, for each hundred group, how many times does 4 appear in the units place.\n\n100-199: For each ten's group, the units digit cycles 0-9, so in each ten's group, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 10 ten's groups (0-9), so 10 times in units place.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 10 times.\n\n400-488: Now, here, the units digit cycles from 0-9, but the tens digit goes up to 8, so the last group is 480-488. So, in the units place, 4 appears once in each ten's group. There are 9 ten's groups (0-8), so 9 times in units place.\n\nWait, let me think: For 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so 9 ten's groups. In each, the units digit goes 0-9, so 4 appears once in each ten's group. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: 100-199: 10 times. 200-299: 10. 300-399:10. 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, hundreds place: 89. Tens place: 40. Units place:39. 89+40=129, 129+39=168. So, total 4's in three-digit numbers:168.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nOne-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20, 20+168=188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: in each hundred group (100-199, etc.), 10 times each, so 4 groups: 10*4=40.\n\nUnits place: in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 10 each, so 30, plus in 400-488, 9 times, so total 39.\n\nSo, 89+40=129, 129+39=168. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 168 in three-digit, 19 in two-digit, 1 in one-digit: 168+19=187, 187+1=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: 8 is one of them, so that's one 8.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: from 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89: that's 10 numbers, so 10 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 88 has two 8's, but when counting units place, it's just one occurrence. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers:100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 8 in the hundreds place would be pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Let's consider each hundred group:\n\n100-199: 180-189:10 times.\n\n200-299:280-289:10 times.\n\n300-399:380-389:10 times.\n\n400-488:480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes up to 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens place in three-digit numbers:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488)=39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred group, how many times does 8 appear in the units place.\n\n100-199: In each ten's group, 8 appears once in the units place, so 10 times.\n\n200-299: Similarly, 10 times.\n\n300-399:10 times.\n\n400-488: Here, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the units digit can be 0-8. So, in each ten's group (e.g., 400-409, 410-419,...,480-488), the units digit 8 appears once in each ten's group. There are 9 ten's groups (0-8), so 9 times.\n\nSo, units place in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place (39) + units place (39)=78.\n\nWait, but let me check: tens place is 39, units place is 39, so total 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nOne-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 90 seems like a big difference.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\nOne-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens place (40-49:10) + units place (14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9) =19\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89\n\nTens place:100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10,400-488:10 (since 440-449 is within 400-488) \u2192 total 40\n\nUnits place:100-199:10,200-299:10,300-399:10,400-488:9 \u2192 total 39\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168 in three-digit.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\n8's:\n\nOne-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit: tens place (80-89:10) + units place (18,28,...,98:9) \u219219\n\nThree-digit:\n\nTens place:100-199:10,200-299:10,300-399:10,400-488:9 \u2192 total 39\n\nUnits place:100-199:10,200-299:10,300-399:10,400-488:9 \u2192 total 39\n\nSo, 39+39=78 in three-digit.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct.

    "text": " Each page number is a three-digit number, right? So, from 1 to 488, but wait, actually, page 1 is just one digit, but when considering digits, I think it's better to treat all page numbers as three-digit numbers by adding leading zeros. So, page 1 would be 001, page 10 would be 010, and so on up to 488. This way, I can analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nNow, I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups and then 8 extra numbers. In each complete group, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48. But wait, I have 8 extra numbers beyond the 480. Those are 481 to 488. Let me check the units digits in these: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the units place, in the extra numbers, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place. Then, we have the last 88 numbers: 401-488. Let's break this down. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Each tens digit appears 10 times except for the last one, which only goes up to 88. Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, the 8 in the tens place appears 8 times (from 481-488). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1 (10 numbers)\n- ...\n- 481-490: tens digit is 8 (10 numbers)\nBut wait, our book ends at 488, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in this last partial group. Therefore, for the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7 in the tens place, each appears 10 times in the 401-480 range, but wait, actually, from 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times. Wait, no, that's not correct because from 401-488, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is only 8 times. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, so in the first 400 pages, 4 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and digit 8 appears 10 times (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, digit 8 in the tens place appears 8 times (481-488). Wait, no, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (481-490). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except that the last group (481-490) is cut short at 488, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times instead of 10. Therefore, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times in the 401-488 range, so total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50\n- Digit 8 appears 10 times in the 401-488 range, but only 8 of those are in the tens place because 481-488 is 8 numbers, so digit 8 in the tens place is 8 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 = 48\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. From 1-400, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times (4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit). Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except for the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times. So, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times in 401-410, but wait, no, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, so digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, that's 8 numbers, so 8 times.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 = 48\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48. So, 4's have 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. From 1-488, the hundreds digit is 0 for pages 1-99, 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me double-check the units place. Earlier, I thought that units digits from 1-488 would have 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the extra 8 numbers (481-488) contributing one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4's are 50, 8's are 48.\n\nHundreds place: 4's are 89, 8's are 0.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nAnd for the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times, plus the first 400 pages where each hundreds group contributes 10 times per digit, so 4 times 10 = 40, total 50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 8's: from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times, plus the first 400 pages where each hundreds group contributes 10 times per digit, so 4 times 10 = 40, total 48.\n\nUnits place: 4's and 8's are both 49.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's total: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the hundreds place for 8's would be zero, which it is, so that seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again: when counting the units place, I considered leading zeros, so page 1 is 001, but does that affect the count? Because in reality, page 1 is just '1', not '001'. So, does the leading zero count as a digit? Hmm, I think not. Because when printing page numbers, you don't print leading zeros. So, page 1 is just '1', page 10 is '10', page 100 is '100', etc. So, in reality, the number of digits printed is variable. So, maybe I should not include leading zeros because they aren't actually printed.\n\nOh no, that complicates things because now I have to consider that the number of digits varies depending on the page number. So, maybe my initial approach was wrong by padding with zeros. Let me try a different approach without considering leading zeros.\n\nSo, page numbers from 1 to 488. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place without padding with zeros.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many 1-digit, 2-digit, and 3-digit page numbers there are.\n\n- 1-digit: 1-9 (9 pages)\n- 2-digit: 10-99 (90 pages)\n- 3-digit: 100-488 (389 pages)\n\nWait, 488 - 100 + 1 = 389, yes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit:\n\nIn 1-digit numbers: 1-9, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nIn 2-digit numbers: 10-99. Each units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. There are 9 tens, so 9 times each.\n\nSimilarly, in 3-digit numbers: 100-488. Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the units place per ten. So, from 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10 times per digit in the units place, so 3*10=30 for each digit. Then, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears once (404, 414, ..., 484), which is 9 times (since 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89/10=8 full cycles with 9 left over, but actually, it's better to think that in 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears exactly 9 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, which is 9*9 + 8, but wait, 89 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 9, so each digit from 0-8 appears 9 times, and digit 9 appears 8 times? Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so units digits go from 0-8, each appearing 9 times, but that's not correct because 89 is not a multiple of 10. Let me think differently.\n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since it stops at 488, the last ten is incomplete. So, from 400-480, that's 81 numbers, which is 9 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-489, but wait, 480-489 is only up to 488, so actually, from 400-488, it's 89 numbers, which is 8 full tens (400-409, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the units place:\n\n- For digits 0-9 in each full ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479): each digit appears 8 times (since there are 8 full tens).\n- Then, in the last partial ten (480-488), the units digits go from 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once.\n\nSo, total units place 4's in 400-488:\n\n- From full tens: 8 times\n- From partial ten: 1 time (484)\n- Total: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSimilarly, units place 8's in 400-488:\n\n- From full tens: 8 times\n- From partial ten: 1 time (488)\n- Total: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, units place total:\n\n- 4's: 1 (1-digit) + 9 (2-digit) + 9 (3-digit) = 19\n- 8's: 1 (1-digit) + 9 (2-digit) + 9 (3-digit) = 19\n\nWait, but earlier when I included leading zeros, I got 49 and 49, but now without leading zeros, it's 19 and 19. That's a big difference. So, which approach is correct?\n\nI think the correct approach is to not include leading zeros because page numbers don't have leading zeros printed. So, the initial approach was wrong because it assumed all numbers are three digits, which they aren't. So, I need to recalculate without padding.\n\nSo, let's proceed correctly.\n\nCounting 4's and 8's in each digit place without leading zeros.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n1-digit numbers (1-9):\n- 4 appears once (page 4)\n- 8 appears once (page 8)\n\n2-digit numbers (10-99):\n- Each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99) has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- There are 9 tens, so 9*1 = 9 for each digit.\n\n3-digit numbers (100-488):\n- From 100-399: 3 hundreds, each with 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place per ten. So, 3*10 = 30 for each digit.\n- From 400-488: Let's break this down. 400-488 is 89 numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since it's 89 numbers, it's 8 full tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488 (9 numbers).\n- In each full ten, units digit 4 appears once, so 8 times.\n- In the partial ten (480-488), units digit 4 appears once (484).\n- So, total units place 4's in 400-488: 8 + 1 = 9\n- Similarly, units digit 8 appears once in each full ten: 8 times\n- And once in the partial ten (488), so total 9.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 1 (1-digit) + 9 (2-digit) + 30 (100-399) + 9 (400-488) = 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 49\nWait, that's the same as before, but this seems conflicting because earlier I thought without leading zeros, it's 19, but now it's 49. I must be making a mistake.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing the approach. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen considering 3-digit numbers from 100-488, the units digit is counted as part of the 3-digit number, so each ten contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, from 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each with 10 tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 3*10 = 30 for each digit.\n\nFrom 400-488, as before, units digit 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 1 (1-9) + 9 (10-99) + 30 (100-399) + 9 (400-488) = 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 49\nSimilarly, units place 8's: 1 + 9 + 30 + 9 = 49\n\nSo, same as before. But this contradicts my earlier thought that without leading zeros, it's different. Wait, perhaps the confusion is that when considering 1-digit and 2-digit numbers, the units digit is the only digit, but when considering 3-digit numbers, the units digit is still part of the count. So, maybe the initial approach with leading zeros was correct because it accounts for all digit places, even if the leading digits are zeros (which aren't printed, but the digit places still exist). So, perhaps the correct way is to consider all digit places, including leading zeros, because each page number can be thought of as a 3-digit number with leading zeros, but when counting digits, leading zeros aren't printed, so they don't contribute to the count.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe it's better to count the number of times each digit appears in each position across all page numbers, considering that 1-digit numbers only have 1 digit, 2-digit have 2, and 3-digit have 3.\n\nSo, let's structure it as:\n\n1-digit numbers (1-9):\n- Units place: 1 occurrence each of digits 1-9.\n\n2-digit numbers (10-99):\n- Tens place: each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times (e.g., 10-19: tens digit 1 appears 10 times).\n- Units place: each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times (since there are 9 tens, each contributing one of each digit).\n\nWait, no, actually, in 2-digit numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so for each digit 0-9, it appears 9 times in the units place (since there are 9 tens: 10-99). Similarly, the tens digit is 1-9, each appearing 10 times.\n\n3-digit numbers (100-488):\n- Hundreds place: digits 1-3 appear 100 times each (100-199: 100 times 1, 200-299: 100 times 2, 300-399: 100 times 3), and digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- Tens place: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. From 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, so 3*10=30 times each digit. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 9 times (since 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10 tens and 9 leftover, but actually, it's 8 full tens (400-409, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so tens digits 0-8 each appear once in the last partial group. So, total tens place for each digit 0-8: 8 +1=9, but wait, no, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8 for each ten, but since it's 89 numbers, it's 8 full tens (400-409, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-8: each appears 8 times in the full tens, plus once in the partial ten, totaling 9 times.\n- For digit 9: appears 8 times in the full tens, but not in the partial ten.\n\nSo, tens place 4's: 9 times\nTens place 8's: 9 times\n\nSimilarly, units place in 3-digit numbers:\n\nFrom 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 3*10=30 times in the units place.\nFrom 400-488: each digit 0-8 appears 9 times, and digit 9 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, units place 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\nUnits place 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 4's were 49, but now it's 39. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me try to structure this properly.\n\nCounting 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers (1-488):\n\n1-digit numbers (1-9):\n- Units place: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n\n2-digit numbers (10-99):\n- Tens place: digits 1-9 each appear 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- Units place: digits 0-9 each appear 9 times. So, 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\n3-digit numbers (100-488):\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n  - 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n  - 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n  - 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n  - So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0\n- Tens place:\n  - From 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30 times each.\n  - From 400-488: each digit 0-8 appears 9 times (as explained earlier), so 9 times each.\n  - So, total tens place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39\n  - Similarly, tens place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n- Units place:\n  - From 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 3*10=30 times.\n  - From 400-488: each digit 0-8 appears 9 times, digit 9 appears 8 times.\n  - So, units place 4's: 30 + 9 = 39\n  - Units place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 1 (1-digit) + 9 (2-digit) + 39 (3-digit) = 49\n- Tens: 10 (2-digit) + 39 (3-digit) = 49\n- Hundreds: 89 (3-digit)\nTotal 4's: 49 + 49 + 89 = 187\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188. Hmm, let's check:\n\nWait, in the 2-digit numbers, tens place 4's: 10, units place 4's:9. So, total 4's in 2-digit numbers:10 +9=19.\n\nIn 3-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:89\n- Tens place:39\n- Units place:39\nTotal 3-digit 4's:89+39+39=167\n\nAdding 1-digit 4's:1, 2-digit 4's:19, so total 4's:1+19+167=187\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n1-digit:1 (units)\n2-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n3-digit:\n- Hundreds:0\n- Tens:39\n- Units:39\nTotal 3-digit 8's:0+39+39=78\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nSo, total 4's:187, total 8's:98\n\nDifference:187 -98=89\n\nWait, but earlier I had 188-97=91. So, which is correct?\n\nI think the confusion arises from whether to include leading zeros or not. When I included leading zeros, I got 188-97=91, but when not including leading zeros, I got 187-98=89.\n\nBut the correct approach is to not include leading zeros because they aren't printed. So, the accurate count should be 187 4's and 98 8's, difference 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the 3-digit numbers.\n\nIn 3-digit numbers, hundreds place:\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199)\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299)\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399)\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n\nSo, 4's in hundreds place:89\n\nTens place in 3-digit numbers:\n\nFrom 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30 for each digit.\n\nFrom 400-488: each digit 0-8 appears 9 times, so 9 for each digit.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's:30 +9=39\nSimilarly, 8's:30 +9=39\n\nUnits place in 3-digit numbers:\n\nFrom 100-399: each digit 0-9 appears 3*10=30 times.\n\nFrom 400-488: each digit 0-8 appears 9 times, digit 9 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, units place 4's:30 +9=39\nUnits place 8's:30 +9=39\n\nSo, total 4's in 3-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds:89\nTens:39\nUnits:39\nTotal:89+39+39=167\n\nAdding 1-digit and 2-digit 4's:\n\n1-digit:1\n2-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\nTotal 4's:1+19+167=187\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\n1-digit:1\n2-digit:10 (tens) +9 (units)=19\n3-digit: tens:39, units:39, hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:1+19+39+39=98\n\nSo, difference:187-98=89\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier when I included leading zeros, I got 188-97=91. So, which approach is correct?\n\nI think the correct approach is to not include leading zeros because page numbers don't have leading zeros, so the initial approach was wrong. Therefore, the correct difference is 89.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place without padding.\n\nUnits place:\n\n1-digit:1 (4), 2-digit:9 (each ten contributes one 4 in units), 3-digit:39 (from 100-488)\nTotal 4's in units:1+9+39=49\n\nTens place:\n\n1-digit:0 (no tens digit), 2-digit:10 (each ten contributes one 4 in tens), 3-digit:39 (from 100-488)\nTotal 4's in tens:10+39=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n1-digit:0, 2-digit:0, 3-digit:89 (from 400-488)\nTotal 4's in hundreds:89\n\nTotal 4's:49+49+89=187\n\nSimilarly, 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n1-digit:1 (8), 2-digit:9 (each ten contributes one 8 in units), 3-digit:39 (from 100-488)\nTotal 8's in units:1+9+39=49\n\nTens place:\n\n1-digit:0, 2-digit:10 (each ten contributes one 8 in tens), 3-digit:39 (from 100-488)\nTotal 8's in tens:10+39=49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n1-digit:0, 2-digit:0, 3-digit:0\nTotal 8's in hundreds:0\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nDifference:187-98=89\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the correct answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the number of times the digits 4 and 8 appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book, then finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Structure:**\n   - Page numbers range from 1 to 488.\n   - Each page number can be 1-digit (1-9), 2-digit (10-99), or 3-digit (100-488).\n\n2. **Count Digit Appearances:**\n   - **4's and 8's in 1-digit numbers (1-9):**\n     - 4 appears once (page 4).\n     - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n   - **4's and 8's in 2-digit numbers (10-99):**\n     - **Tens place:** Each digit 1-9 appears 10 times. So, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times.\n     - **Units place:** Each digit 0-9 appears 9 times. So, 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n\n   - **4's and 8's in 3-digit numbers (100-488):**\n     - **Hundreds place:**\n       - 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n       - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n     - **Tens place:**\n       - From 100-399: Each digit 0-9 appears 30 times (3 hundreds \u00d7 10 per hundred).\n       - From 400-488: Each digit 0-8 appears 9 times.\n       - Total for 4 and 8: 30 + 9 = 39 each.\n\n     -"

    "text": " Each page number can be a one-digit, two-digit, or three-digit number. Since the book has 488 pages, the page numbers go from 1 to 488.\n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll need to consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, the units place. In every set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10: 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20: 4 appears once (page 14), and so on.\n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll have 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once per block) plus one more time in the 481-488 range (page 484). So that's 49 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the 481-488 range, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So 4 appears once here, at 484. So yes, 48 complete blocks give 48 fours, plus 1 more, totaling 49 fours in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and 240-249, and 340-349. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Well, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So that's five blocks. Each contributes 10 fours, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check. From 40-49: 10 fours. Then 140-149: another 10, that's 20. 240-249: 30, 340-349: 40, and 440-449: 50. So yes, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but I'm only considering the hundreds place, so each of these 89 numbers adds one 4. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89). Let's calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nWait, wait a second, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 is indeed 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overcount. For example, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, each number contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, which is correct. In the tens place, each block of 100 contributes 10 fours, and there are five such blocks, so 50 fours. Units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, plus one more in the last partial block, so 49.\n\nWait, but when I add them up, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once per block. There are 48 full blocks of 10 in 488 pages (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 80-89: that's 10 numbers, contributing 10 eights in the tens place. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, so that's 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4 * 10 = 40 eights, plus the last block 480-488 contributing 9 eights. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me confirm. 80-89: 10 eights. 180-189: another 10, so 20. 280-289: 30, 380-389: 40, and 480-488: 9, so 40 + 9 = 49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nSo, total eights: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Let me recount. Each block of 10 has one 4 in units place. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 50. Each block of 100 has one block where tens digit is 4, contributing 10 fours. From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5 * 10 = 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49. Each block of 10 has one 8, 48 full blocks, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49. Each block of 100 has one block where tens digit is 8, contributing 10 eights. From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four blocks contribute 4 * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility I overcounted somewhere? For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. That's correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and one partial block (481-488), contributing 1 more 4. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers has a 40-49 block, contributing 10 4's. There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Total: 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's. Total: 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8. There are 48 full blocks and one partial block (481-488), contributing 1 more 8. Total: 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each block of 100 numbers has an 80-89 block, contributing 10 8's. There are four full blocks and one partial block (480-488), contributing 9 8's. Total: 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages have 8 in the hundreds place. Total: 0.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
