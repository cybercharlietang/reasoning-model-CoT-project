    "text": " So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 in the tens place appears in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except maybe the last block. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me confirm: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Yes, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, let's count how many sets: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9 gives 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let me check each block. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, and the last block contributes 9 eights. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49.

Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers. So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, okay, so the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for eights. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s, so no eights in the hundreds place. That's correct. Similarly, in the tens place for fours, I considered up to 440-449, which is correct because 449 is less than 488. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Wait, but when I counted the units place for fours, I went up to 484, which is correct because 484 is less than 488. So, that's 49 fours in the units place. Wait, but let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct. Similarly, for eights in the units place, up to 488: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For the tens place in fours, I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Correct. For eights in the tens place, I had 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98. Difference:188-98=90.

So, in the hundreds place, the 480-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.

Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers. So, 89. 49+50+89=188. Correct. For eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Yep, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, totaling \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n   - 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:** \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, let's count each block. 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49.

Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 are included. So, let's count how many sets of 100 we have. Each 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488 as the tens digit, but only 9 times. So, total eights in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. Each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 1-400, how many hundreds blocks? 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.

So, the difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the eights in the tens place. Let me recount.

Let me see: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for each hundred, except the last one, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9 =49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, let's count how many full sets we have. Each full set (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 sets \u00d710 =40 eights. Now, the last set is 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (including both ends). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So, total in tens place:40 +9=49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which is from 480-488. Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, total eights in the tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.

Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers (except the last one) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place:49, so 49+49=98. Hmm, that seems correct. So, total fours are 188 and total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more fours than eights. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high.

Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. Now, eights: Units place:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets has 10 numbers, so 40. The last set, 480-488, is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, so 0.

But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's calculate how many numbers are in each set. Each full set (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so that's 4 full sets: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, that's 9 eights.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.

Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the hundreds place, right? Because in the hundreds place, 400-488 includes 440-449. But in the tens place, I counted 40-49, 140-149, etc., which are all before 400. So, that seems correct. Wait, but when I count the hundreds place for fours, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right because from 400 to 488 is 89 numbers. Wait, let me confirm: 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. For the eights, in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, contributing 9 eights. So, 40+9=49 in the tens place. Units place: 49. So, total eights: 98. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is indeed 90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488), totaling 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers), totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

But wait, the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Wait, let me check again. Units place:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers. Let me just quickly verify if I missed anything. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299:280-289 (10). 300-399:380-389 (10). 400-488:480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the tens place: 10 (from 80-89) +10 (180-189) +10 (280-289) +10 (380-389) +9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9=49.

So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10th number, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The last block has 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n\nNumber of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 eights, except the last one, which is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking fours: units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? Let's see, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block has 10, so 5 blocks: 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, eights: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 49. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's printed is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
