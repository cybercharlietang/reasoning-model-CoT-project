But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. Each full set (e.g., 80-89) has 10 numbers, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, the first four sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights in the tens place, and the last set (480-488) has 9. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place has 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, I subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.

Wait, 480-489 would also have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.

Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me think again. When counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place count, but actually, in the tens place, 440-449 is correct because the tens digit is 4. Similarly, for eights, 480-488 is correct for the tens digit being 8. So, yes, the counts seem accurate.

Each has 10 numbers, so 5 sets:5x10=50. Correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0: total 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the book. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 eights in the tens place, except maybe the last block. Let's see: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. For units place of fours: 4,14,...,484. That's (484-4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct. For eights: units place:8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place:80-89 (10),180-189 (10),280-289 (10),380-389 (10),480-488 (9). So 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, since 800>488. So, 98 eights. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me think again about the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. Yes. And for eights, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 480 is the first and 488 is the last, so 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, that's correct. So, yeah, I think 90 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 fours, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four blocks contribute 10 eights each, totaling 40.

Wait, 480-489 would be next, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me count how many sets of 100 have 8 in the tens place. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, so 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, and then the 480-488 set contributing 9 eights. So, that's 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

Units place:49, tens:49, so 98 total eights. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's. Let me just double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, total=98.

    "text": " So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count how many numbers in each set. 80-89:10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, let me make sure. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 188-98 is 90, but I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through each part again. Counting fours: units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, starting at 4. The last one is 484, which is 484=4 + 10*(n-1). So, n-1 = (484-4)/10 = 480/10=48, so n=49. So, units place:49 fours. Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Total fours:49+50+89=188. That's correct. Now, eights: units place. Numbers ending with 8:8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in units place. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188 fours -98 eights=90. Hmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I feel like I might have missed something. Let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Correct. And for eights, in the tens place, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 eights in the tens place for that set. So, 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, let's break it down. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40. Now, the next set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total.

Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 4 and the last term is 484, with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such blocks up to 440-449.\n   - Total = 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of terms = 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 8 appears in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 8 and the last term is 488, with a common difference of 10.\n   - Number of terms = ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block contributes 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total = 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total = 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 would be part of that range. So, how many sets do we have? Each set is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488 is part of the next set, but it's only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the last partial set from 480-488 contributes 9 eights (since 480 is the first and 488 is the last). So, total eights in the tens place: 40 +9=49.

Because 480 is the first, then 481,..., up to 488. So, 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, yes, 9.
