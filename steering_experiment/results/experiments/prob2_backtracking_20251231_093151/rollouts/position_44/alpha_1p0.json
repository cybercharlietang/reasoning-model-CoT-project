So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each have 10 eights, so that's 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 eights (480,481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place.

So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 49. So, tens place:49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place:0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total eights:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's. For the tens place, I had 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4*10=40 plus 9=49. That seems correct. Similarly, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. That's 49 numbers, as 484 is the 49th occurrence. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449, which is 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For 8's, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, so 98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 occurrences, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four blocks have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489.

So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 10 +10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.

That seems correct. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again. For fours: units place: 49, correct because from 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, so 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 50, correct because 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Total fours: 49+50+89=188. For eights: units place: 49, correct because from 8 to 488, every 10, so 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. Total eights: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

The formula is ((last - first)/step) +1. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49.

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Let me see how many sets there are. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8.

So, let's count how many 8's in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except maybe the last block. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, so 8+1=9.

So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts.

When I counted 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10. Then 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49.

Eights: units 49, tens 49, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. I think that's correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Yep. And for the tens place, 5 sets of 10, so 50 fours. Units 49, so total 188. Eights: units 49, tens 49, so 98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, but 488 is included, so let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each block: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. Wait, that's 49+49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Let me just cross-verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90.

    "text": " Wait, because 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, units place has 49 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 488, so that's the last set. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Let me check: 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me think again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 49. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it as follows: For the tens place, the 8 appears in the tens digit every 100 numbers, starting at 80. So, in 1-100: 10 numbers (80-89), 101-200:10 (180-189), 201-300:10 (280-289), 301-400:10 (380-389), and 401-488:9 (480-488). So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total eights are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 +49=98? But when I thought of units place, I had 49 eights, and tens place also 49, so total 98. But wait, earlier when counting fours, I had 188 fours. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights would be 90 more fours than eights. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting eights. Let me recount the tens place. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. Units place: from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers. So, 8,18,28,...,488. Let me check how many terms that is. The nth term is 8 +10(n-1)=488. So, 10(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in units place. So, total eights: 49+49=98. So, fours:188, eights:98. The difference is 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check that again. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Units place:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights, units:49, tens:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. When I counted the tens place for fours, I had 50 fours. Let me check that. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d710=50. That seems correct. So, yes, 50 fours in the tens place. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 484 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens digit in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 49 (since 488 is the 49th occurrence).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488) which contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Wait, that can't be right because 488 is the 49th term. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 48 sets would give 48 eights, but in the 49th set, which is 481-490, but our book only goes up to 488. So in that last partial set, 481-488, the units digit 8 occurs once at 488. So total units place 8's: 48*1 +1 =49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each block. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers here. So total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (each 100 block) plus 9 in the last partial set. So 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, total fours:188, total eights:98. The difference is 188 -98=90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That's correct. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, because 488-400+1=89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That's correct. For eights, in the tens place, I counted 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, etc.) which is 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49. That seems right. Units place: from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, which is 49 numbers. So, 49 units eights. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly? Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. And for eights, in the tens place, I have 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many terms? Let's see, the first term is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 terms. So, units place eights:49. So, total eights:49+49=98. Fours:188. 188-98=90.

But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. So, each full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last).

Let's see if 480-489 is within the book's pages. The book goes up to 488, so 480-488 is included.

Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of this. So, each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, then 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, total tens place eights would be 4 sets of 10 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.

Tens place: 49 eights. So total eights are 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.

For eights: Units place:49, tens place:49, so 98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me check the tens place for eights again. From 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. Units place:49, tens:49, total 98. So, yes, 188-98=90.

Tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four blocks gives 10 eights, and the last block gives 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total eights:49+49=98.

So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n\nWait, let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units place: 49 (as 4,14,...,484). That's correct because 484 is the 49th number.\n- Tens place: 5 sets of 10 (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449). Each set has 10, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units place: 49, as 8,18,...,488. That's correct.\n- Tens place: 40-489 would have 10 in each hundred, but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 sets of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours -98 eights=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Let's count each block. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights in total. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. Units place:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. Yes, that's correct. So, total eights are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my counting because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.

This is every 10 numbers, starting from 4 up to 484. There are 49 such numbers (since 484 \u00f7 10 = 48.4, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in the tens place in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** '8' appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is every 10 numbers, starting from 8 up to 488. There are 49 such numbers (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, rounded up to 49).\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block contributes 10 numbers except the last block, which contributes 9 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (40) and 9 more, totaling 49 eights in the tens place. Wait, no: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place has 49 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Wait, that's 49+49=98. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units place: from 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers, as 488 is the 49th. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total eights are 49+49=98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours in the hundreds place. From 400-488: that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Then, in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets: 5*10=50 fours. Units place: 4,14,24,...,484: that's 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units place: 8,18,...,488: 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98 eights. So, 188-98=90.

Wait, but 480-489 would be the next set, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except the last block, which only has 9. So, let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9.

For the tens place of 8's, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), which is correct. So, 49 eights in tens place. For the fours, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. Units place for fours: from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the 49th number, so 49 fours. Tens place for fours: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 50 fours. So, 49+50+89=188 fours. For eights, units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: perhaps using a formula for digit counting. The number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n can be calculated using a method where you consider each digit position and calculate based on higher, current, and lower digits. But since I've already counted manually and got 188 fours and 98 eights, I think it's correct.
