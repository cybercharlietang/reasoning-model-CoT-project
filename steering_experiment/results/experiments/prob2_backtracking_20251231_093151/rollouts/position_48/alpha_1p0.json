So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm that. Units place:49, tens:49, so 49+49=98. That seems correct. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. And for the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred block, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 5*10=50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so 488/10=48.8, which we took as 49, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 4 appears in the units place, which is every 10 numbers. So, 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place, 49 in units place, total 98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Each hundred block has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last one. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers). So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total: 188. For eights: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total:98. Difference:188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me verify the units place for fours and eights. For fours in units place: from 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For eights in units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. For fours in tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50 fours. Correct. For eights in tens place:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last set only has 9 numbers, so total is 4*10 +9=49. Correct. For hundreds place: fours go from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Eights don't appear in hundreds place. So, 89 fours. Correct. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.

Now, the next set is 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers: 480-488. So, in the tens place, how many eights?

    "text": " From 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, because 488 -480 +1=9). So, that's 4 sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 eights in the tens place. Wait, is that correct? Let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours -98 eights =90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n  \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Each full hundred has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's 4 sets, totaling 40 eights. Now, the next set is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So total tens place eights: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (fours) -98 (eights)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me check again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems right. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yeah, that seems correct.
