So, that's 10+10+10+10+9=49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I think I might have made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for fours. Let me check again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, I had 5 sets of 10: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each gives 10 fours, so 5*10=50. Units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1)=484. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in the units place. So, total fours:49+50+89=188. Eights: units place, 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, so 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 eights in units. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four sets gives 10 eights, and the last set gives 9 eights. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for eights would have some, but no, since 488 is less than 800. So, yes, 90 seems correct. But let me check once more. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula or another method to verify. For counting digits, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1) / 10) * 1. Similarly, for the tens place, it's floor((N + 1) / 100) * 10 + max(0, (N + 1) % 100 - 10*(d)). But maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, I can think of each position separately. For the units place, as I did before, 49 fours and 49 eights. For the tens place, 50 fours and 49 eights. For the hundreds place, 89 fours and 0 eights. So, adding up: fours:49+50+89=188, eights:49+49+0=98. Difference:188-98=90. Yeah, I think that's correct.

Wait, let me check that again. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40, plus 9 is 49. Yep, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units place 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 is indeed 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Wait, when I counted the tens place for fours, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Let me count how many sets that is. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. Similarly, for eights in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 sets, but the last one only has 9 numbers, so 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

For fours: Units place: 49, correct because from 4 to 484 is 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 5 sets of 10, so 50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So 49+50+89=188. For eights: Units place: 49, correct because from 8 to 488, 488-8=480, 480/10=48, plus 1 is 49. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Hundreds place: 0. So total eights:49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that's correct. Maybe I should check a smaller example to see if my method works. Let's say a 20-page book. How many 4's and 8's? Page numbers 1-20. Counting 4's: units place:4,14 => 2. Tens place:40-49, but wait, the book only goes up to 20, so tens place 4's are 40-49, which is beyond 20, so 0. Hundreds place: 0. So total 4's:2. 8's: units place:8,18 =>2. Tens place:80-89, beyond 20, so 0. So total 8's:2. So, 2-2=0. That makes sense because in 1-20, 4's and 8's appear the same number of times in units place, and no 4's or 8's in tens place. So, the method works here. Another example: 50 pages. 4's: units place:4,14,24,34,44 =>5. Tens place:40-49:10 numbers. So total 4's:5+10=15. 8's: units place:8,18,28,38,48 =>5. Tens place:40-49: but wait, 80-89 is beyond 50, so only 8's in units place:5. So total 8's:5. So, 15-5=10 more 4's. Let me check manually: from 1-50, how many 4's and 8's. 4's: 4,14,24,34,44 (units:5), and 40-49 (tens:10), total 15. 8's:8,18,28,38,48 (units:5), and no tens place 8's because 80-89 is beyond 50.

    "text": " - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total eights in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again. For fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But let me confirm: 488-400+1=89. So, that's correct. For the tens place, fours: each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, and there are 5 hundreds (0-4, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, no, actually, the hundreds go from 0-4 in the hundreds place. So, 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. So, that's 5 sets where the tens digit is 4. Each set contributes 10 fours, so 5*10=50. That's correct. So, total fours:188, eights:98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when counting, off-by-one errors can happen. Let me check the units place for fours again. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. That's correct. For eights in units place, same calculation: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct. For tens place eights: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is10, 380-389 is10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total eights=98. Fours: 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds, total=188. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in page numbers 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets each contribute 10 eights, and the last set contributes 9.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of 8's: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
