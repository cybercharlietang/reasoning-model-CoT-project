So, that's 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights here. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's.

So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 fours. For the tens place, in the hundreds, like 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place for the 400s. But I think I counted 5 sets of 10 in the tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems right. For the eights, in the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five sets, but the last set is only 9 numbers, so 4 full sets of 10 and one set of 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Wait, but I just realized something. In the hundreds place for fours, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 fours. But in the tens place, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place. So, that seems correct. Wait, but in the hundreds place, we have 89 fours, which is correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188. Eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98. So, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe the hundreds place for eights would have some, but no, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, no eights in the hundreds place. Therefore, the difference is 90. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount the fours and eights separately to confirm. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for fours, I considered 440-449 as part of the tens place. Wait, in the tens place for fours, each block is 10 numbers, so 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct. Similarly, for the units place, 49 fours, which I think is correct because from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So that's right.

For the eights, units place: 49, which is from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9), totaling 49.

    "text": " 80-89:10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 4 sets of 10 (totaling 40) plus 9, which is 49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here. Adding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Wait, let me check again. Units:49, tens:49, so total 98 eights. So, now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The question is how many more fours than eights, so 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last block being 480-488 (9 numbers). Totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Each full set (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers, so 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Now, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total tens place eights: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, totaling 49. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So that's 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours -98 eights=90. Wait, let me confirm the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each full set contributes 10, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No occurrences as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"
