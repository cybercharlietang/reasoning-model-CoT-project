    "text": " Let me think. The first page with a 4 in the units place is 4, which is the 1st occurrence, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on. So, from 4 to 484, how many numbers is that? The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1. So here, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same formula as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), not 10. So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9. So, total tens place occurrences: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n   \nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as there are no pages in the 800s.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. If I consider the numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, giving 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which adds one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, right? So, that's another 10 numbers. So, how many blocks is that? From 0-399, we have 4 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349), each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. Then, 440-449 is another block. So that's 5 blocks, each with 10 fours, so 5*10=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 fours. Wait, no. Wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let me go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, which ends with an 8. So, how many such numbers? From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Let me check: 8, 18, ..., 488. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. So, 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? From 0-399, we have 4 blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. Then, 480-488 contributes 9 eights in the tens place. So, total tens place eights: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 800, but wait, the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place eights: 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1st Digit):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (2nd Digit):**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (3rd Digit):**\n   - 4 appears from page 400 to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (1st Digit):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (2nd Digit):**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (3rd Digit):**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit in any page number up to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The formula is usually (last occurrence - first occurrence)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's one set. Then each hundred has another set: 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within the 400-488 range, so that's valid. So, that's five sets. Each set contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but the book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 488, so yes, 5 sets. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range. So, each hundred has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, except for the last set, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). Let me count the sets: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 4 full sets and one partial set. Each full set contributes 10 8's, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last set contributes 9 8's. So, total in the tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 98 is 90, but I'm not sure if I did the counts correctly. Let me go through the 8's again, especially the tens place. For the tens place, the ranges are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's each, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 8's. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct. For the units place, from 8 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 49 times. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98. For the 4's, units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89, totaling 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I thought the answer might be 90, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, it's easy to make off-by-one errors. Let me check the units place for 4's. The first 4 is at 4, and the last is at 484. So, how many numbers? (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. That's correct. For the tens place, 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, so 5 x10 =50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. Correct. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, 98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and a partial range (480-488).\n   - Full ranges contribute 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - Partial range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check. The numbers go 4,14,24,...,484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, which divided by 10 is 48, so there are 49 numbers. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has another block of 10. So, from 100-488, how many hundreds are there? 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so the 440-449 block is within 400-488, but 450-488 doesn't have another 4 in the tens place. So, how many blocks of 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place are there? Let's see: 40-49 is 1 block, then 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let me see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The difference is 488-8=480, divided by 10 is 48, so 49 numbers. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another block, but since the book ends at 488, the 480-488 range is only 9 numbers (480-488). So, does that count as a full block? No, because 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, the digit is 8 for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there? Let me think. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then, 480-488:9. So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10. Then, 480-488 is 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times 8 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but we take the floor, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each 10 numbers) and then 8 more numbers. So, in each full cycle of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial cycle (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8? The number of terms is floor(488 / 10) = 48, but let's check. 48 x 10 = 480, so 488 is 480 + 8, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th occurrence? Wait, let's see: starting from 8, each 10 numbers adds one 8 in the units place. So, from 1-10: 8 once. 11-20: 18 once. ... 481-490: 488 once, but since the book ends at 488, the last occurrence is 488. So, how many times? The number of times is the number of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and then 8 more numbers (481-488), where 488 has an 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that makes sense. Because 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place. How many such full ranges are there? From 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, each of these 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens digit. So, that's 9 more 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would occur in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times (from 4, 14, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 49 times (from 8, 18, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me think. The units place cycles every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So that would be 49 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, and 484 is one of them, so that's one more. So total 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: the first is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. Wait, that can't be right. Let me check my math again. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is indeed 188. So 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So from 1 to 488, how many numbers ending with 8 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So units place has 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges contributes 10 times. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, the tens place 8 in 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8, so 480-488 has 9 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 times instead of 10. So total tens place 8's would be 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the hundreds place 4's, but the tens digit is 8. So the tens place 8's in 480-488: from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 from 480-488. So 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place contributes 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. Total 98. So 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check the units place again. For 4's in units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many terms? The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So (484 -4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. For 8's in units place: from 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48 +1=49. Correct. For 4's in tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. Correct. For 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. Wait, earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 4 full ranges (80-89, etc.) plus 9 in 480-488, making 4*10 +9=49. Correct. For hundreds place, 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. 8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488. So yes, 188 -98=90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, giving 48 fours. Then, in 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included. So that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This occurs in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-488, the tens digit is 4 in the 40s, 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. That's five ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Units place: 49 fours. Tens place: 50 fours. Hundreds place: 89 fours. So total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 8 in the units. So, that would be 49 times. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. For 480-488, that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through it again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The first term is 4, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So, 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 fours in units place. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5 ranges *10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 fours in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. That's 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, the last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, difference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the answer might be 90, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nLet me try another approach for the 4's.\n\nIn the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? As before, it's every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48 full tens, and then check if the remainder includes another 4. 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so the last 4 in units place is at 484, which is 48*10 +4=484. So, 48+1=49 fours.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\nNumbers where tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (first 100), 140-149 (next 100), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 fours.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\nNumbers where hundreds digit is 4: 400-488. That's 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as before, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, the last has 9. So, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in 8's. For example, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as:\n\nFor each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since 488 ends with 8, which is greater than 4, we add 1, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since 488 ends with 8, we add 1, so 49.\n\nWait, but that's the same as before.\n\nWait, but for the tens place, it's a bit different. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the tens place up to number N can be calculated as:\n\nLet me recall the formula. For the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\nLet higher = number formed by digits higher than tens place.\n\nLet current = digit in tens place.\n\nLet lower = number formed by digits lower than tens place.\n\nIf current > d: count += (higher + 1) * 10\n\nIf current == d: count += higher * 10 + (lower + 1)\n\nIf current < d: count += higher * 10\n\nBut maybe it's easier to just count manually as I did before.\n\nAlternatively, for the tens place:\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4: 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n\n- There are 488//100=4 full hundreds, and then 88 remaining.\n\nWait, 488 divided by 100 is 4 with remainder 88.\n\nSo, in each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), how many have tens digit 4? From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 4*10 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred, there's one set of 10 numbers with tens digit 8: 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n\nSo, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40.\n\nIn the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, that matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, that's 89 numbers.\n\n8's: none, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, 89 fours in hundreds place, 0 eights.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens)+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm missing any edge cases. For example, in the units place, when counting 4's, is 484 included? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. Similarly, 488 is included in the units place for 8's.\n\nAnother way to think about it: the number of times a digit appears in each position can be calculated using the formula, but since the number is not too large, manual counting seems manageable.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for each digit position, calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal numbers:488.\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10)=48, but since the last digit is 8, which is greater than 4, we add 1, so 49.\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's: floor(488/10)=48, and since the last digit is 8, we add 1, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 50.\n\nNumber of 8's: floor(488/100)=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. In the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/1000)=0 full thousands, but the hundreds digit is 4 in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, same counts as before.\n\nThus, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because sometimes when counting digits, especially in the tens and units places, it's easy to make an off-by-one error. Let me verify with smaller numbers to see if the method is correct.\n\nFor example, let's take a smaller number, say 20 pages. How many 1's and 2's are there?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCount of 1's:\n\nUnits place:1,11 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place:10-19 \u2192 10 times.\n\nTotal 1's:12.\n\nCount of 2's:\n\nUnits place:2,12 \u2192 2 times.\n\nTens place:20 \u21921 time.\n\nTotal 2's:3.\n\nDifference:12-3=9.\n\nUsing my method:\n\nUnits place 1's: floor(20/10)=2, since 20 ends with 0, which is less than 1, so no extra. So 2.\n\nTens place 1's: floor(20/100)=0, but in 10-19, which is 10 numbers, so 10.\n\nTotal 1's:12.\n\nUnits place 2's: floor(20/10)=2 (2 and 12).\n\nTens place 2's: floor(20/100)=0, but 20 is included, so 1.\n\nTotal 2's:3.\n\nDifference:12-3=9. Correct.\n\nAnother test: pages 1-100.\n\nNumber of 1's:\n\nUnits:10 (1,11,...,91)\n\nTens:10 (10-19)\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:20.\n\nNumber of 0's:\n\nUnits:9 (10,20,...,90)\n\nTens:9 (100 is included? Wait, 100 has two 0's, but in the tens and units place.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick to the original problem.\n\nBut in any case, the method seems to work for smaller numbers, so I think it's correct.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total: 49 occurrences.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit within 1-488.\n   - Total: 0 occurrences.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Let me think. If I consider the numbers 4, 14, 24, ..., 484, that's from 4 to 484 with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449, not 440-449 beyond 488. Let me check how many full sets there are. Each set has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is actually 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many 4's are in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is a partial set because 488 is the last page. So, let's break it down. Each full set (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.) has 10 numbers. How many full sets are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 full sets *10 = 40, plus 9 from the partial set. So, 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   \nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four sets contribute 10 each, and the last set contributes 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. The numbers would be 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms can be calculated by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but the hundreds digit can't be 0 because that would make it a two-digit number, but in the tens place, 4 can appear in numbers like 40-49, which are two-digit, and in three-digit numbers like 140-149, etc. Let's count them: - 40-49: 10 numbers - 140-149: 10 numbers - 240-249: 10 numbers - 340-349: 10 numbers - 440-449: 10 numbers So that's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences. However, wait, the last range is 440-449, but our book only goes up to 488. So, 440-449 is within 488, so all 10 numbers are included. Therefore, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). However, we're only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, so each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but 480-489 would be another range, but our book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Therefore, the range 480-489 would have only 9 numbers in our case. So, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 numbers, and one partial range (480-488) with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1-10: one 4 (at 4), 11-20: another 4 (at 14), and so on. The number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra in the incomplete decade. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 complete decades and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete decade, there's exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. In the last partial decade, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me check again. If I consider each group of 10 numbers, from 0-9, 10-19, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488. So, from 0-9: one 4 (at 4). Similarly, each group up to 480-488 will have one 4 in the units place. How many such groups are there? The total number of groups is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the last group, 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included. So, that's one more 4. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that seems correct. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, contributing 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. And 400-488: 440-449, which is another 10 numbers (since 440-449 is within 400-488). So, how many ranges is that? From 0-99: 1 range, 100-199: 1, 200-299:1, 300-399:1, 400-488:1. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. That occurs from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of such numbers is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the last partial decade, 480-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding another 8. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488 (but wait, 480-489 would be another range, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488). Let's count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). Wait, no: 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. However, since the book ends at 488, the tens digit 8 in 480-488 is only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488 because the tens digit is the second digit. So, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? Because 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, up to 488 is 4-8-8. So, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many ranges? From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899. But our book ends at 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98. Difference: 188 - 98 = 90. That seems correct. But let me verify the counts again, just to be sure. Units place for 4's: from 4, 14, ..., 484. The number of these is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place for 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct. Units place for 8's: 8, 18, ..., 488. (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. That's 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 numbers, and 480-488 with 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct. Hundreds place for 8's: none, since the book ends at 488. So, 0. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488.

There are 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete tens in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4. But wait, the last partial set from 481 to 488 includes 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, actually, it's 48 times. Hmm, but wait, from 1 to 480, that's 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the next 4 in units would be 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the ones digit across all page numbers. So, for each 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the incomplete group from 481 to 488, the 4 in the units place is at 484, which is one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. In 200-299, 240-249, another 10. In 300-399, 340-349, another 10. In 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This happens in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, let me add up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 8, so 48. But wait, the last number is 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, in the incomplete group from 481 to 488, 488 is included, so that's one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the range for the hundreds digit 4 and tens digit 8. So, how many sets are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit can be 8? Wait, our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 4 at maximum, right? Because 488 is less than 500. So, the hundreds digit is either 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems right. But wait, let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. The sets are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Yes, that's 5 sets, each with 10 numbers, so 50. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set (480-488). Each full set contributes 10, so 4*10=40, and the partial set contributes 9, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place for 4's, I had 49, which is correct because from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place, and the last partial set includes 484, which is the 49th. Similarly for 8's, the last number is 488, so that's the 49th occurrence in the units place.\n\nSo, yes, 4's: 188, 8's: 98, difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting, we find that there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49, that's one set, then 140-149, another, and so on up to 440-449. From 40-49: 10 numbers, each with a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? Well, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 40-49), 1, 2, 3, or 4. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last set is 440-449, and our book goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4, which occurs from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, I need to count the number of 8's. Let's do the same approach for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10 each time. The number of terms can be calculated by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's check each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: how many numbers here? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four sets and 9 times in the last set. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers, from 4, 14, ..., 484.

Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 484 is included, which adds one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is within 488. 480-489 is up to 488, so that's another block. So, blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, each block except the last one has 10 numbers. So, first four blocks: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98.

    "text": " Let me think. The numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms in this sequence is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's see how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 180-189 (10) From 200-299: 280-289 (10) From 300-399: 380-389 (10) From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four ranges give 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the last range gives 9. So total in tens place is 40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. That would be 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 5*10=50. That's correct. Units place: 49, as calculated. So 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place, 49; tens place, 49; hundreds place 0. So 98. 188-98=90. Wait, but wait, when I was counting the 8's in the tens place, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, which is correct because 488 is the last page. So 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct. So, yes, 98 8's. Therefore, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges of 10 and one partial range (480-488) with 9 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book only goes up to 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which would have 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Then, in 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete sets of 100 there are in 488. There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, for the first four hundreds (1-400), that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's printed. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, similar to 4's, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, and then 488 itself adds another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last set is 480-488. Let's count each set: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 numbers - 280-289: 10 numbers - 380-389: 10 numbers - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, the tens place contributes 49 8's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's printed. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. The total number of such sets is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. So, that means there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last set is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the 48th set would end at 480, and then from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the 49th set, the units digit 4 appears only once at 484. So, that would be 48 full sets plus one more, making it 49 times. Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so it's 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then the 49th set would be 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in that partial set, the units digit 4 is at 484, which is within 481-488. So, that adds one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. This happens from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, let me add up the number of 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, similar to the 4's, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's see, the first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the 49th set (481-490) includes 488, so that's another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full ranges do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers. So, that's 4 full ranges with 10 each and one partial range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, 80-89: 10 numbers, correct. 180-189: 10, correct. 280-289: 10, correct. 380-389: 10, correct. Then 480-488: 9 numbers, as 488 is the last page. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49, which is correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's were 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. The tens digit is 4 in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, we have four full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial range (480-488), which is 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it is, for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula. Maybe I should try that to confirm.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then check if the remaining numbers (488 - 48*10=8) include a 4. Since 48*10=480, the remaining numbers are 481-488, which includes 484, so one more 4. So total 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full cycles, and the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, so one more 8. So 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers with tens digit 4. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is part of the 400-499 block, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 50 in total.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in tens place: each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds? 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4*10=40. Then, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that confirms the earlier counts.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's in hundreds place: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNumber of 8's in hundreds place: zero, since the book only goes up to 488, so no page numbers from 800-899.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to approach this is to consider each digit position separately and calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is given by:\n\nfull_cycles = N // 10\n\nremainder = N % 10\n\ncount = full_cycles * 1\n\nif d <= remainder:\n    count +=1\n\nSo, for 4 in units place:\n\nfull_cycles =488//10=48\n\nremainder=488%10=8\n\nsince 4<=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly for 8 in units place:\n\nfull_cycles=48\n\nremainder=8\n\nsince 8<=8, count=48+1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nThe formula is a bit more complex. For the tens digit, each digit d appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times per block. So, the number of times d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\nfull_blocks = N // 100\n\ncount = full_blocks * 10\n\nremainder = N % 100\n\nif remainder >= 10*(d+1):\n    count +=10\nelif remainder >= 10*d:\n    count += (remainder - 10*d +1)\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. So, for each full hundred block, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nThen, for the remaining part beyond the full hundreds, we check how many times d appears in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 4's in tens place:\n\nfull_blocks =488//100=4 (since 4*100=400, 5*100=500 which is beyond 488)\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nremainder=488-4*100=88\n\nNow, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. But the remainder is 88, so 40-49 is within 0-88? Wait, no. Wait, the remainder is 88, which is the last two digits beyond the full hundreds. So, the tens digit in 400-488 can be from 0-8.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that after 400, the tens digit can be 0-8, as 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, count +=10.\n\nThus, total 40 +10=50.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in tens place:\n\nfull_blocks=4\n\ncount=4*10=40\n\nremainder=88\n\nIn the last partial hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, count +=9.\n\nTotal 40 +9=49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nThe digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place, as the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think this confirms that the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with a partial range in 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. Each set has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included here, which is another 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, we have four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is the same as the number of 4's in the units place, right? Wait, no, because 488 is included. Let me calculate. The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89 eights in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 89 eights = 99. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For fours: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, total 188. For eights: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 0, total 89. Difference is 188 - 89 = 99. Yeah, that seems right. I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for fours. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. And for eights, no hundreds place contributions. So, yeah, 188 - 89 = 99.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (including 484).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences (including 488).\n   - **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 such blocks, each contributing 10 occurrences, totaling 40.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 40 + 0 = 89.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 89 = 99.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Let me check. The sequence is 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Each step increases by 10, so the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count how many ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, from 400-488: the tens digit can't be 8 because 480-489 would be the next, but our book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but earlier, I considered the tens place as 80-89, etc., which are 10 numbers each. So, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many ranges have 10 numbers? From 0-399, we have 4 ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers, but actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that part is correct. Also, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, correct. So, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place (ones place):** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range has 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place (ones place):** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This sequence has 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers in 800-899, so 0.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each complete set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440 to 449 is within the range, but 540 to 549 would be beyond 488, so we don't need to consider that. So, each of these decades contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's count how many such decades there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but wait a second. When we get to 440-449, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit is also 4, so each number in this range contributes a 4 in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, let's add up all the fours: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. Again, we'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many? From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 8? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing an 8. But wait, 488 is included, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, let me think again. For each 10 numbers, there's one 8 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then the 49th ten starts at 480, which includes 488. So, that's 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is in the units place at 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me count: 8, 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term can be represented as 8 + 10(n-1). So, 8 + 10(n-1) \u2264 488. So, 10(n-1) \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens digit being 8. This occurs in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place, except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 eights in the tens place. - 180-189: another 10. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last one contributes 9. So, total eights in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me confirm: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit being 8. The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights in total. Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. Units place: 49 eights. Tens place: 49 eights. So, total eights: 98. Hmm, but earlier, when counting fours, I got 187 fours. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But wait, that seems like a lot. Let me verify my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 eights? Wait, no, for 4's in units place: from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 is 48*10 + 4, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 fours in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 sets, 5*10=50 fours in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. How many? The last one is 488, which is 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. So, 10*(n-1)=480, so n-1=48, n=49. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 eights in tens place, and 480-488 has 9 (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, 4*10 + 9 = 49 eights in tens place.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 fours - 98 eights = 89. So, 89 more fours than eights. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I count 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc. But wait, does 480-488 include 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 eights in tens place from 480-488. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the units place, 488 is included, which is the 49th occurrence of 8 in the units place. So, 49 eights in units place.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nFours: 187.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484). There are 48 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each decade (40-49, 140-149, etc.), totaling 5 decades \u00d7 10 = 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each decade (80-89, 180-189, etc.), with the last range (480-488) contributing 9. Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is the 4th number. Then every 10 numbers after that. So from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10, but I think I need to adjust because 488 is the last number. Alternatively, for each hundred, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the units digit is 4. Since 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, so 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds plus 88 pages. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 401-488 range, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me see: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, total units place 4's: 40 + 9 = 49? Wait, no, because 400-499 would be 10 times, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times. So, for the units place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, but the last hundred (400-488) only has 9 times. So total units place 4's: 3 hundreds * 10 + 9 = 39 + 9 = 48? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the number of complete groups of 10, plus any extra in the incomplete group. So, for 488 pages, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 // 10 = 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 in the units place. But wait, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (e.g., 4,14,24,...). So, 48 times. But wait, does 488 include 488? Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing 1, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th group ends at 480, and then 481-488 is the incomplete group. In the incomplete group, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that seems correct. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, counting how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have? 488 pages, so 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, the tens digit 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 times. So, how many such ranges are there? From 40-49 (1st hundred), 140-149 (2nd), 240-249 (3rd), 340-349 (4th), and 440-449 (5th). Wait, but 440-449 is within the 400-488 range. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 times. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall entirely within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many times does 4 appear here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\n1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to the 4's, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. So, how many times? 488 // 10 = 48 complete groups, each contributing 1 occurrence. But wait, 488 is included, so the last occurrence is at 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, 8,18,...,488: that's 49 numbers because 488 is the 49th term in the sequence starting at 8 with a common difference of 10. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** How many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the range. So, let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488)\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10, which is 40, plus 9 in the last range, so 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, tens place 8's: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, total 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because I might have made a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 8,18,...,488. So, 488 is included. So, how many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We set that equal to 488: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 => 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, from 4 to 484. The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, 10(n-1)=480 => n-1=48 => n=49. So, 49 times. Correct.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place, we have 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, 5 ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, so total 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 4 to 484, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, occurring 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The numbers would be 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's actually 49 numbers because from 0 to 484, it's 485 numbers, but we're only considering the units digit. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me check. Alternatively, the number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the total number of pages divided by 10, rounded down, plus one if the units digit of the total is 5 or more. Wait, maybe a better approach is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, in the 49th group (481-490), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one range (10 numbers). Similarly, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many ranges? Let's see: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 fit within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places again. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the 49th group (481-490), 488 is within that, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of that range. Let's count how many full ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, as 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total 8's in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and one range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: Units place: 49, Tens:50, Hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units:49, Tens:49, Hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - The 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total numbers: 48 full groups of 10 (480) plus 1 in the 481-490 range.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total numbers: 48 full groups of 10 (480) plus 1 in the 481-490 range.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each full range (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, and 480-488 has 9.\n   - Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 4 to 484, how many numbers are there where the units digit is 4? Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 / 10 = 48 numbers. Then, 484 is the next one, so that's 49. So, maybe I should add 1 more. So, units place 4's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99, we have 40-49: 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, 140-149: 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249: 10, 300-399: 340-349: 10, and 400-488: 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book ends at 488, that's fine. So, tens place 4's: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 here, so how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full steps, but the last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these contributes 10 numbers except possibly the last one if it's cut short. Let's check each: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers. Wait, 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers, not 10. So, for the tens place, how many 8's? Let's see: Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488, totaling 49 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., but the last range (480-488) has only 9 numbers, totaling 49 times.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. If I consider the sequence 4,14,24,...,484, the number of terms is actually (484 - 4)/10 + 1. So that's (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many sets of ten there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has a 40-49 range, so for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but 400-449 would be the next set, but 450-488 is beyond that. So, how many complete sets of 100 are there? Up to 400, we have four sets (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). But since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 400-449, which is 50 numbers. Wait, no, 400-449 is 50 numbers (including both 400 and 449). So, each of the first three hundreds (100-399) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 3 sets \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place is 30 + 10 = 40. Wait, but 400-449 is part of the 400-488 range, so that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-449) = 40. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. So, total 4's in hundreds place: 89. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, 178 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is at 488. So, how many terms? Using the formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 100-399, that's 3 sets \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 30 + 9 = 39. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (39) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 39 = 88. So, 88 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 178 (number of 4's) - 88 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything. For 4's: units 49, tens 40, hundreds 89. 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. For 8's: units 49, tens 39, hundreds 0. 49 + 39 = 88. 178 - 88 = 90. Yeah, that seems right.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers).

So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 times. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? Let's see: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 10+10+10+10+9 = 49 times. Wait, but is that correct? Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 = 9. So, yes, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place with 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. Each set has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in 1-100, 40-49 is one set. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4 in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188. Hmm, but I might have made a mistake here because in the hundreds place, it's only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, but each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the last number is 488, which is the 489th number, so that's another 8. Wait, but 488 is included, so the count would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488), totaling 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such ranges are within 488. 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10. 280-289: yes, 10. 380-389: yes, 10. 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in 480-488? Let me check: 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many full sets of 10 do we have? 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total in the tens place: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. Wait, but I thought each of the first four ranges (80-89, etc.) contributes 10, and the last one contributes 9. So, 4 ranges with 10 each, that's 40, plus 9, total 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 4's: 188. Total 8's: 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere. Let's start with the number of 4's again. Units place: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has a 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the 481-490 range, 484 is within 488, so that's another 4, making it 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That's correct. Now, for 8's: Units place: 8, 18, ..., 488. 488 is included, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the 488, which is another 8, so 49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4 x 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so 9. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Correct. Hundreds place: none, as before. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but I think I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's correct. But wait, when counting the 4's in the hundreds place, each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, 89 is correct. Similarly, for 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none, so that's 0. So, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so the difference is 90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again. Maybe I overcounted somewhere. Let me recount the 4's in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. So, 49 in the units place. Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 89. So, total 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188. Correct. Now, 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. So, same as before, 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, total 8's:49 +49=98. So, 188 -98=90. Hmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 in the units place is at 4, which is the 4th number. Then every 10 numbers after that. So from 4 to 484, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The total count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong. So, the correct count is 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? For each number from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 numbers, meaning 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many such numbers? Let's calculate: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199:180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299:280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399:380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488:480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page). So, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So total in the tens place: 4*10 +9=40+9=49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. The first 4 in the units place is at 4 (which is the 4th number), then every 10 numbers after that. So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. So, 49 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I was too quick to take the integer part. Let me check: The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to how many complete groups of 10 there are in 488, and then see if the last group has a 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups and a partial group. Each complete group has exactly one 4 in the units place, so that's 48. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are within 488. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. Now, 440-449: that's another, but we have to check if 449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's another full range. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's fine. So total 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me do the same for 8's. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times. The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete groups and a partial group. Each complete group has one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, in the partial group (481-488), 488 is included, so that's one more. So total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. Let's count the full ranges: 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, the first four ranges are full, each contributing 10, and the last one contributes 9. So total in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800 and 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8's appear 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a bit high. Let me go through the 4's again. Units place: 49, tens place:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, plus 89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. And each has a 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89. Now, for the tens place of 4's: I counted 5 ranges: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Units place: 49, which is correct because from 4,14,...,484. 484 is the last one, which is 484-4=480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. Now, for 8's, units place: 49, correct. Tens place: ranges 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. So 4 full ranges and one partial. Each full range is 10, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. So that's correct. So 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a lot. Let me check if I missed anything. Maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's? Let me recount: 400 to 488 inclusive. 488-400+1=89. Yes, that's correct. So 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, for the tens place of 4's: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, right? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's another 10. So 5 ranges, 50 numbers. Correct. Now, units place: 4,14,...,484. Let me count how many numbers that is. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10. So, (484 -4)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. So, 49 units, 50 tens, 89 hundreds: total 188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So 4*10=40 +9=49. Correct. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. I think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. The numbers go from 1 to 488. So, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit 4 occurs at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. So, actually, it's 49 times in the units place. Hmm, maybe I should use a different approach. The number of times a digit appears in the units place up to N can be calculated as floor((N + 1) / 10) for that digit. But wait, maybe it's better to think of it as for each digit d, the count in the units place is (N // 10) + 1 if the units digit is >= d, else (N // 10). Wait, no, perhaps a better formula is: For units digit, the count is (N + 1) // 10 if d != 0, else N // 10. But I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach. For the units digit, the number of 4's from 1 to 488 is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place. So, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. But then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), does 4 appear in the units place? Yes, at 484. So that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (another 10). Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? 5 blocks (each 10 numbers). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so all 5 blocks are within 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, breaking it down into units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, but let's see. The 8's in the units place occur at 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. But in the last partial set, 481-488, does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, 488 is the last number, so that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8's in the tens place occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189. 200-299: 280-289. 300-399: 380-389. 400-488: does 480-489 have 8 in the tens place? But 488 is the last page, so 480-488 includes 480-488, but 489 is beyond 488. So, 480-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, but only up to 488. So, how many numbers have 8 in the tens place from 400-488? It's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences, not 10. So, the blocks are: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, from 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. For the tens place, 4's: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Units place for 4's: 4,14,...,484. How many? From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, so 488//10=48, plus 1 because 484 is included, so 49. Correct. For 8's: units place, 49 times. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears once every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial set (481-488) includes 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, except the last block (480-488), which contributes 9.\n   - Total blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n   - Total: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. If I consider numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480/10 = 48 occurrences. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit is 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 49th occurrence. So, maybe I should calculate it as (488 // 10) + 1 if the last number is within the range. Wait, let me check. Alternatively, I can think of it as for each hundred, there are 10 numbers where the units digit is 4. From 1-100, there are 10 such numbers. From 101-200, another 10, and so on. But since 488 is less than 500, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 4's in the units place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So total units place 4's: 40 + 9 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many full decades we have. From 1-488, we have the following ranges: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: 10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 ranges each contributing 10 numbers. So that's 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, the tens place has 50 occurrences of 4. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 numbers. So, hundreds place contributes 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding up all the places: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. From 1-488, the first occurrence is at 8, then 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? Let's calculate. The number of times 8 appears in the units place is equal to how many full tens are there in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, meaning 48 occurrences. But wait, 488 is included, which is 8 in the units place. So, that's the 49th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of it. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, from 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, the tens place 8's are: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences of 8. Now, adding up all the places: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Checking 4's: units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. Checking 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. Wait, when I calculated the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Units place: 49. So, 188 total 4's. For 8's: units place: from 8,18,...,488. 488 is included, so 488//10=48, but since 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49. Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 in tens place. So, total 8's: 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. From 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 8,18,28,...,488. The total number is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, that's correct. Similarly, for the tens place, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 49. So, 8's: 49+49=98. So, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. So, the answer should be 90. Wait, but let me think again. Wait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems correct. Now, for the tens place of 4's: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5 ranges, 50 numbers. So, that's correct. Units place for 4's: from 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many? From 1-488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10)=48, but since 484 is included, it's 49. So, 49. So, total 4's:49+50+89=188. Similarly, for 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98. So, difference is 188-98=90. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in page numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\).\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389).\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: \\( 4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49 \\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n\\( 188 - 98 = 90 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So from 1 to 488, how many full cycles of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, in each cycle of 10, the units digit goes from 0 to 9, so the 4 appears once per cycle. So, 48 cycles would give 48 times. But wait, the last number is 488, which is in the 48th cycle (since 480-489 is the 48th cycle). But 488 is within this cycle, so the units digit 4 in 484 is the 48th occurrence.

Each block of 100 numbers has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, how many such blocks are there?

Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct.

So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, we can take (488 - 8)/10 + 1. That's (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Wait, but 488 is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, how many numbers? Let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Let's see: From 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). 101-200: 180-189 (10 numbers). 201-300: 280-289 (10 numbers). 301-400: 380-389 (10 numbers). 401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=40+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This occurs in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 187 (4's) -98 (8's)=89. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, +89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me check again, maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, how many numbers? 488-400+1=89. So, yes, 89 times. And for the tens place of 4's, I had 5 blocks, each 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right. For the units place of 4's, I had 48 numbers, which is correct because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does the 48th cycle end at 480? Then, 484 would be the last 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, so total 98. So, 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, and there are 5 such blocks.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187 times.**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98 times.**\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89.**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1-10, there's one 4; 11-20, another 4, and so on. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, meaning there are 48 complete cycles and a partial cycle. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, 488 is included, but its units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last 4 in the units place would be 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many numbers are in each of these ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, so 10 per range. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one. 100-199: 140-149 is another. 200-299: 240-249. 300-399: 340-349. 400-488: 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440 is included, right? So, 10 numbers each. So, 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This occurs in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the number of 4's: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last page is 488, which ends with an 8, so that's included. So, from 1 to 488, how many multiples of 10 plus 8 are there? That's (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. This happens in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each range. Each range has 10 numbers, except maybe the last one. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, the first four ranges give 10 each, and the last gives 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 +49 +0=98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) =89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " Let me think. The first number is 4, which is the 1st occurrence, then 14 is the 2nd, and so on. So, 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. Solving for n: 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. Now, 400-488: Here, the tens place is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10. So, from 1-488, how many blocks of 100 are there? 400-488 is part of the 400s, so the tens place 4 occurs in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place has 89 occurrences of 4. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 8 + 10*(n-1) = 488. 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the 400s. So, let's count each block: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, but the numbers go from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the 800s, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete decades and 8 extra numbers. So, in each complete decade, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the 480-488 range, the units digit goes from 0 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, I'm only interested in the hundreds digit being 4, which is 89 numbers. However, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete decades, which gives 48 occurrences. But wait, in the last decade (480-488), 488 is included, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488. Each of these ranges (except maybe the last one) has 10 numbers. Let's count them: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total in the tens place is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, but wait: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480 is the first, 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers (since 480 is the first, 481 is the second, ..., 488 is the ninth). So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 97 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. That seems correct. For 8's: units=48, tens=49, hundreds=0. 48+49=97. So, 187-97=90. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 4's. Let me recount that. For 4's in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That's correct because 440-449 is within 488. So, 50 is correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. That's 5 ranges, but the last one has only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 +9=49. That's correct. So, the difference is indeed 187-97=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Number of occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - First four ranges have 10 numbers each; the last has 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in any hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 48 + 49 + 0 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each of these numbers has a 4. So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's calculate how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), right? Because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each block: - 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). - 100-199: 180-189 (10). - 200-299: 280-289 (10). - 300-399: 380-389 (10). - 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, that's 4 blocks with 10 each and 1 block with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This totals 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The numbers are 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Each of these is 10 apart, so from 4 to 484, how many numbers? The formula is ((last - first) / step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many numbers there are in each set. Each set has 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 is 10 numbers). Now, how many such sets are there? The tens digit is 4 in the ranges 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, but in the last range, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, but since we're only looking for tens digit 4, it's 440-449. So, how many sets? From 0-99: 40-49 is one set. From 100-199: 140-149 is another set. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets. Each set has 10 numbers, so 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's. Now, adding them all up: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Let me count how many sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another set (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 4 sets with 10 numbers each and one set with 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: (4\u00d710) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's there are. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((484 - 4) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each set has 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets.\n   - Number of occurrences: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four sets have 10 each, and the last set (480-488) has 9.\n   - Number of occurrences: (4 \u00d7 10) + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete tens. So, 48 times 1 is 48. But wait, 488 is the last page. So, the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, starting at 4, 14, 24,..., 484. Let's calculate how many times that happens. The first 4 is at 4, and the last is at 484. The difference between 484 and 4 is 480, which divided by 10 is 48, so that's 48 intervals, meaning 49 numbers? Wait, no, because when you count from 4 to 484 in steps of 10, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Let me check another way. From 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then 14, 24,..., 484. The last term is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. So, (n-1)*10 = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. So, 49 times. So, 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is entirely within 1-488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 4's is 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. The difference is 488-8=480. Divided by 10 is 48, so 48 intervals, meaning 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each and 1 range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. This would be the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. The first occurrence is at 4 (which is 1), then 14 (2), 24 (3), ..., 484 (which would be the 49th number because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4). Wait, maybe I should calculate it differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups. Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. But then, the last partial group (481-488) also includes 484, which is another 4. So, that would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. Let me confirm. From 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, which would be in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 is the first, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me see how many there are. The last occurrence is at 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), right? Let me check: 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, contributing 9 8's in the tens place. So total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. But wait, did I count the hundreds place for 4 correctly? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Yes, that's correct. For the tens place of 4, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. Correct. Units place for 4: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...484. That's 49 numbers. Correct. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...488, which is 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. So, the difference is indeed 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me think. From 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, and 480 divided by 10 is 48, so there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. But wait, starting from 4, each 10 numbers adds one more 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let me calculate it as (488 + 1) // 10 for the units digit. Wait, no, that's not quite right. The formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to number N is floor((N + 1)/10). So, for 4's in units place: floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48.9, which is 48 times. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let me count how many such blocks there are. From 1 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks in total. So, that's 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and since the book only goes up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 1-488, so yes, it's 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the numbers 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** Similarly, 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, using the same method as before, floor((488 + 1)/10) = floor(489/10) = 48. So, 48 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's check if 480-489 is within the book. The book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 80-89 in the hundreds. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89 is one block, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10 numbers, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9 numbers. So total in the tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place would be numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up the occurrences of 8: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, 8 appears 97 times. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449, totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n  \nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, totaling 48 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the book ends at 488.\n  \nTotal 8's: 48 + 49 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. Each set has one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, maybe I was right the first time. So, units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours printed. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The last number is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so that's 49 times. Wait, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many terms? The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. We want 8 + (n-1)*10 \u2264 488. So, (n-1)*10 \u2264 480, so n-1 \u2264 48, so n \u2264 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, we have 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 blocks, each contributing 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 40 + 0 = 89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 89 = 99. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units=49, tens=40, hundreds=0. 49+40=89. So, 188-89=99. Hmm, but I feel like that might be correct. Let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position. For units place: For 4's, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if the remainder is >=4. 488/10=48.8, so floor is 48, and since 0.8*10=8 >=4, so 48+1=49. Similarly for 8's, floor(488/10)=48, and since 8>=8, so 48+1=49. Wait, that's the same as before. For tens place: For 4's, each hundred has a block of 10 where tens digit is 4, so from 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49 in that hundred, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so 40-49 in the tens place is 440-449, which is another 10. Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Let me think: The tens digit cycles every 100. So, in each 100 numbers, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10. So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10=50. That matches what I had before. For 8's in tens place: Similarly, from 1-488, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block is 10 numbers, so 4 blocks, 4*10=40. That's correct. Hundreds place: For 4's, from 400-488, each number has 4 in the hundreds place, so 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, 89 4's. For 8's, hundreds digit can't be 8 because the book ends at 488, so 0. So, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188. Total 8's:49 (units)+40 (tens)+0=89. So, 188-89=99. So, the answer should be 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449). There are 5 such blocks, contributing 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (80-89, 180-189, ..., 380-389). There are 4 such blocks, contributing 40 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 89.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99.\n\n\\boxed{99}"

    "text": " Let me think. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which means 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. Wait, no, 484 is the 48th occurrence because 480 / 10 = 48. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does the last block go up to 488? The block 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's count how many. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8) / 10) + 1 = (480 / 10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, let me check: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The difference between each term is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such blocks there are within 488. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. That's four blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Wait, but does 380-389 go up to 389, which is less than 488, so yes, all four blocks are included. So, 40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 40 = 89. Now, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 89. To find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract: 187 - 89 = 98. So, there are 98 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.
