    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Wait, no, actually, when counting from 4 to 484 in steps of 10, the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is okay, but 480-489 would be beyond 488. So, let's count each set. - 40-49: 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. So, 10 4's. - 140-149: Another 10 4's. - 240-249: Another 10 4's. - 340-349: Another 10 4's. - 440-449: Another 10 4's. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is valid. Let's count each set. - 80-89: 10 numbers, contributing 10 8's. - 180-189: 10 8's. - 280-289: 10 8's. - 380-389: 10 8's. - 480-488: How many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place here. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. That's 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and 480-488 contributes 9, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 4 to 484). Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence because 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 + 1) / 10, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the last page is 488, the highest units digit is 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is 48th occurrence. So, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let's count how many sets of ten have 4 in the tens place. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 numbers. Therefore, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48 + 50 = 98, and 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, I can think of it as (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let's count each set: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers. So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by taking the total number of pages, dividing by 10, and then taking the integer part. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, does the last group (480-488) include a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is within that range. So, that's 48 times, plus one more for 484? Wait, no, because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, when I think about it, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last units digit is 8, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 440-449. Let's count how many numbers have 4 in the tens place. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, but we need to check if 440-449 is fully included in 488 pages. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, from 40-49: 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but let me confirm. The first range is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent hundred has another 10. So, 100-199: 140-149, that's 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440-449). So, that's 5 sets, each with 10, so 50. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Let's calculate. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1. That's (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, let's count each range. - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289:10. - 380-389:10. - 480-488:9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (4, 14, 24, ..., 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (8, 18, 28, ..., 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, let's add up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. To find how many numbers: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, let's count each block: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 +10 +10 +9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, there are 48 intervals of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus the first one at 4, making it 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Let me think again. If I have numbers from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. In each cycle of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete cycles of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 4. So that's 48 times. But wait, in the 48th cycle, which is 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the last cycle is incomplete. However, in the units place, 480-488 includes 484, which is a 4 in the units place. So, that's the 48th occurrence. Therefore, units place gives 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49 (that's one), then 140-149 (two), 240-249 (three), 340-349 (four), and 440-449 (five). So, that's five ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours. But wait, do we go up to 449? Since the book has 488 pages, yes, 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Therefore, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, there are 187 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the fours, the 8 appears every 10 numbers in the units place. So, numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 eights in the units place. But wait, in the last cycle, 480-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, units place gives 48 eights. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count how many ranges: 80-89 (one), 180-189 (two), 280-289 (three), 380-389 (four), and 480-488 (five). Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights in the tens place. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, which is 9 eights. So, the first four ranges give 4 * 10 = 40 eights, and the last range gives 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Adding up all the eights: units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 48 + 49 = 97. So, there are 97 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 187 fours - 97 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete sets of 10, contributing 48 fours. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49 fours. However, upon re-evaluation, since 484 is included in the 48th set, it's actually 48 fours.\n   \n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each range (40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are five such ranges, contributing 50 fours.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488, totaling 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187 fours**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 eights.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers in each range (80-89, 180-189, etc.), with the last range (480-488) contributing 9 eights. Total tens eights: 4*10 + 9 = **49 eights**.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal eights: 48 (units) + 49 (tens) = **97 eights**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 fours - 97 eights = **90 more fours**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, maybe it's 48 numbers up to 480, and then 484 is the 49th. Wait, let me think again. From 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? Each step adds one more 4 in the units place. So, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, but since 484 is included, we have 48 full tens and then one more, so 49 times. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me list some numbers to check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete sets of 10 in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4. But wait, does 488 include an extra 4 in the units place? No, because 488 ends with an 8. So, the units place 4's go up to 484, which is 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4. So, that's 48 times. Wait, but when I count from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, how many numbers is that? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, that's 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me confirm. The formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. Okay, so units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens digit. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first range is 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's five ranges. Each contributes 10, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all five ranges are within 488. So, tens place: 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, plus 89=188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nAgain, we'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many times. Using the same method as before: the first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, units place: 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such ranges are within 488. 80-89: yes, 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, 10. 280-289: yes, 10. 380-389: yes, 10. Next would be 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, only 480-488 are included. So, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. So, tens place: 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nNow, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, checking the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times. That seems correct because from 4 to 484, stepping by 10, gives 49 numbers.\n- Tens place: 50 times. That's correct because there are five ranges (40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449), each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times. From 400 to 488, inclusive, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. That seems right.\n\nNow, for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times. From 8 to 488, stepping by 10, gives 49 numbers.\n- Tens place: 49 times. Four full ranges (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) contributing 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, actually, it's 48 full tens (1-480), each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 484 adds one more. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete decades (groups of 10) plus any extra numbers. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade (481-490), but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, from 1-480, there are 48 occurrences, and then in 481-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, that seems correct. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place (second digit from the right):** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long, so each contributes 10 occurrences. Let's see how many such ranges there are. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the following decades: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 decades. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is within 1-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place (third digit from the right):** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then in the 49th decade (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the units digit 8 occurs at 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, let me check: from 1-480, 48 occurrences, and then 488 is the 49th. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences. - 180-189: 10 occurrences. - 280-289: 10 occurrences. - 380-389: 10 occurrences. - 480-488: 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so 9 occurrences. So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, 49 times the digit 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many complete groups there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. The number of numbers is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the number of 4's in each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, how many numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times the digit 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these is 10 numbers. Let's see how many complete groups there are. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-489: but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's? For 80-89: 10. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So total is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait a second, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, that's 9. So, 49 times the digit 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, maybe it's better to calculate it as (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me see: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 484 is indeed the last 4 in the units place before 488. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, so that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-489, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is included). So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges with 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) plus 9 in 480-488. So, 4*10 +9 = 49. So, 49 times. Wait, let me check that again. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488: 9 numbers). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of 4's in the units place is the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48. But wait, 488 is the last number, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think differently. The number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, for each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. Then, in the incomplete block from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, so 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's five ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check the last range: 440-449. The next range would be 540-549, but 540 is greater than 488, so we don't have that. So, only up to 440-449. So, that's 5 ranges, 10 numbers each, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Wait, no. Wait, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. Wait, but let me confirm. 400 is the first, 401, 402,... up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count as an 8 in the units place? Yes, because 488 ends with an 8. So, let's count how many times 8 appears in the units place. From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the incomplete block from 481 to 488, we have 488, which is another 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place occur in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many complete ranges there are. 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: which is 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, for the first four ranges, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place. The last range contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me think again. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. The fifth range is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, yes, 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in counting the number of 4's in the hundreds place. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: 49+49=98. Difference: 90. So, the answer should be 90. But wait, let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each with 10 numbers, and the last range 480-488 with 9 numbers, totaling 49. So, that seems correct. So, I think my calculation is correct, and the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed in the page numbers is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 gives 48, but we need to add 1 because both endpoints are included. Wait, no, maybe a better way is to think that every block of 10 numbers has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so maybe it's better to think that the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. So, for each ten's place, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each ten's place, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many ten's places are there? From 0 to 48, because 480 is the last page. Wait, no, the ten's place goes up to 8 in the last page 488. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this. Alternatively, the number of 4's in the units place is equal to the number of times 4 appears in the units digit from 1 to 488. So, the first occurrence is at 4, then every 10 numbers. So, how many such numbers? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. So, from 4 to 484, how many terms? The formula is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Now, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the tens digit can be 4 in the 40s, 140s, 240s, 340s, and 440s. That's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 times 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** How many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, it's every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. The last number is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, let me check: 8,18,28,...,488. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) has 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so that's 9. So total 40+9=49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, but we add 1 to include both endpoints, so 49 times. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as follows: For each full set of 10 numbers, the digit appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. Each of these contributes one 4 in the units place. Then, in the 480-488 range, the units place goes from 0 to 8. So, the 484 is within this range, so that's an additional 4. So total units place 4's: 48 (from the full tens) + 1 (from 484) = 49. Hmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, using a formula: The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + 1 if the last digit is d or higher. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate it as follows: For units digit 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. The number of terms can be found by ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't include that. Let's see: How many full groups of 100 are there? From 1 to 488, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred). So, for the first four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and then from 450-488, the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400-499 range, but since our book ends at 488, we have 440-449 as 10 numbers. So, total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10, so the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is part of that. Let's count: Each hundred block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from 1-488, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the 4's again: Units place: 49, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct. Now, 8's: Units place: 49, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4*10 + 9 = 49. That's correct. Similarly, for 4's in the tens place, it's 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So, 4*10 + 10 = 50, which is correct. Wait, but in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. So, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).

    "text": " So actually, from 4 to 484, there are 48 numbers where 4 is in the units place. Wait, let me check: 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. The formula for counting how many times a digit appears in a specific place is to take the higher digits, then the current digit, then the lower digits. For units place, it's (higher digits) * 10^0 + 1 if current digit is greater than the target, or (higher digits) if equal, plus the lower digits + 1 if current digit is greater. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it as for each complete set of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. So, numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. Wait, but does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4. So, numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, but let's check. Numbers ending with 8: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 ends with 8, so let's count how many. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8. So, numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 480-488. How many sets are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, total in tens place: 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, so 49. Wait, no: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8. So, numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. Correct. 188-98=90. Yes, that seems right. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 4 sets \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as 800-899 exceeds 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, but we have to add 1 because both ends are inclusive. So that would be 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 484 is the 48th multiple of 10 plus 4, right? Because 484 is 48*10 + 4. So, 48 times plus the first one, 4, which is the 1st occurrence. So maybe it's 49 times in the units place. Hmm, I think I need to double-check that. Let me think: from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers after that. So, 4,14,24,...,484. The total number is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's five ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, let me check the last one. 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 only for page numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. So that's 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The digit 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's count how many. The first is 8, last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-489, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 480-488. Hmm, so the last range is only 9 numbers because 489 is beyond 488. So, how does that affect the count? Let's see. For the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each has 10 numbers. The last one, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's are 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10 numbers, 80-89. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. Then 480-488: 9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in page numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (e.g., 400-488)\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as every 10 numbers, starting from 0 to 488. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Wait, let's check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th block would be 480-488, and in that block, the units digit 4 is at 484, which is within the block. So, yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many such ranges there are. The first is 40-49, which is in the first hundred. Then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 ranges (from 0 to 4 hundreds), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check. From 1-99, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. From 100-199, 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 4's, so 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place, which would be from 400-488. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is included, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The last occurrence is at 488, so from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. Wait, but let me check: 488 is included, so 488 is the 49th term. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. The last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each with an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 (as each block of 10 has one 4, and 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, but wait, does the last block (480-488) have a 4 in the units place? Yes, at 484, which is within that block. So, 48 is correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49, as from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, gives 49 numbers.\n\n- Tens place: 49, as 4 ranges of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one range of 9 (480-488), totaling 4*10 +9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49+49=98.\n\nThus, 187-98=89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 occurrences.\n   - Total occurrences: 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 49 terms).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - The first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last contributes 9.\n   - Total occurrences: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, each decade (0-9, 10-19, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. The number of decades from 0 to 484 is 48 full decades (0-9, 10-19, ..., 470-479) plus the 480-484 range. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times 4 appears in the units place. The first page with a 4 in the units place is 4, and the last is 484. The number of such pages is (484 - 4)/10 + 1. Let me compute that: (484 - 4) is 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 240-249, another 10. 300-399: 340-349, another 10. 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. So, pages 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-488 has 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, the 480-488 range would have 8 in the tens place for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, each of the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many full ranges are there? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10. Then 480-488:9 numbers. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10, which is 40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. Wait, but wait, 80-89 is in the first 100 pages, then 180-189 in the next 100, etc. So, up to 380-389, that's four ranges, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is another 9. So, total 49 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 can be calculated by considering how many complete groups of 10 there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In those 8 numbers, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? Let's see: The first is 40-49, which is in the 40's, then 140-149 (140's), 240-249 (240's), 340-349 (340's), and 440-449 (440's). So that's 5 ranges. Each contributes 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Wait, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through each digit position: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last number is 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then an additional 8 in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges: 80-89 (one range), 180-189 (second), 280-289 (third), 380-389 (fourth). So that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, is there a 480-489 range? Yes, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is part of that. But wait, the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place. However, since the book only goes up to 488, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). But wait, in the tens place, the 8 is in the tens digit, so 480-489 would all have 8 in the tens place. But since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (from 480 to 488 inclusive). So, the 480-488 range is another 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges * 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488, so 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but wait, the 480-488 range is part of the 400-488 pages, and the tens digit is 8. So, that's correct. So, tens place 8's: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 4 such ranges.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " So, actually, it's 48 full tens and then one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and a partial block from 481 to 488. In each full block, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 484 is included, which is another occurrence. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 4. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0 to 488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in 89 numbers. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8. Then, in the partial block 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so yes, it's included. So, units place 8's: 49. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see if 480-489 is included? But the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens digit 8. So, how many ranges? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, the first four ranges each have 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, but wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, total 8's printed:98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, actually, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 times? Wait, let me think again. If I consider from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is the last number where 4 appears in the units place. So, that's 48 times in the units place. Wait, but 480 is the 48th set, and 480 is included, so 480 is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 40-49: that's one set, 140-149: another, 240-249: another, 340-349: another, and 440-449: another. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. But wait, let's check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so all 5 sets are valid. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 4 appears 187 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers. From 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many times that is. The last number is 488, which is 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8. But wait, 48 x 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets, each contributing one 8. Then, 488 is the next number, which is 488, so that's the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 488 is within the range, so does that mean 49 times? Let me think. From 8 to 488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The first is 8, then every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is given by the formula: ((last - first) / difference) + 1. So, ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8 can appear in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10, and 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last). So, let's calculate: 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4 x 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, 8 in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, number of 4's is 187, number of 8's is 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 48 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Number of ranges: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, so \\( 5 \\times 10 = 50 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n   - Number of numbers: \\( 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\) times.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** \\( 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 \\).\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of occurrences: \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{488 - 8}{10} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 49 \\) times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributes 10 numbers, totaling \\( 4 \\times 10 = 40 \\).\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 numbers.\n   - Total: \\( 40 + 9 = 49 \\) times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - Occurrences: 0 times.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** \\( 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 \\).\n\n**Difference:**\n- More 4's than 8's: \\( 187 - 98 = 89 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think again. The formula is usually (last occurrence - first occurrence)/interval + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? Well, 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is another 10, 380-389 is another 10. Wait, does 480-489 count? Well, 480-489 is within 488, so 480-488 is part of it. So, that's another 9 numbers (from 480 to 488). So, how many ranges? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, that's 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, total is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, but is 480-488 part of the tens place 8? Yes, because in 480, the tens digit is 8. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, total eights in tens place: 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but 488 is included, so that's correct. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. Each full block (like 80-89, etc.) contributes 10 occurrences. So, from 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from the last partial block. So, total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, actually, the count is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, but does 484 count as one? Let me check. From 4 to 484, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles. So yes, 484 is the 49th occurrence. But wait, the total number of pages is 488, so 484 is within that. So, units place gives 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 numbers as well because 449 is within 488. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, right? So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 up to 488. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: Here, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the first four ranges contribute 4 x 10 = 40, and the last range contributes 9. So total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total eights are 98. Now, to find how many more fours there are than eights: 188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90. So, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Yes, because 484 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 4. Wait, no, actually, from 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? Let's see, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The total count can be calculated by (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such groups there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid because 449 is less than 488. So that's 5 groups, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 5*10=50. However, wait a second, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so it's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The count is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another group, but since the book ends at 488, we have 480-488. Let's count each group: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, the first four groups each have 10 numbers, and the last group has 9. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, total 8's printed are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's.

    "text": " So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place would be 48 (from 4 to 484). Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488, plus any extra. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last group is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within 480-489. So, in each full group of 10, the units digit 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so does the 48th group end at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th group? So, in the 49th group, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the last page, and the 48th group ends at 480, so the 49th group is 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, in the 49th group, the units digit 4 appears at 484, which is within 481-488. So, total units place 4's would be 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (from 481-488), totaling 49. Okay, so units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 40-49 (10 numbers), then 140-149 (another 10), 240-249 (another 10), 340-349 (another 10), and 440-449 (another 10). So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, totaling 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, 449 is less than 488, so all 10 numbers in 440-449 are included. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from page 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many times? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. But wait, 488 is included, so in the 49th group (481-490), 488 is within that, so the units digit 8 appears at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from 1-480) plus 1 (488), totaling 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Each full range (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many full ranges there are. The first is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488. The first four ranges are complete, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. Therefore, the tens place contributes 40 + 9 = 49 8's. Wait, no. Wait, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, so each number from 480 to 488 has 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4 ranges *10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10 are there? Let me calculate (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449, but wait, since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let's see how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each set occurs every 100 numbers. So, the first set is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many sets are there? From 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, and the book goes up to 488, so that's okay. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. Wait, but 488 is the last page. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? Let's subtract 400 from 488 and add 1: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check how many such sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, and each occurs every 100 numbers. So, starting from 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, since the book goes up to 488. So, 480-488 is part of the 480-489 range, but since 488 is the last page, we have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, that's 9 numbers. But wait, the full set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, how many sets do we have? Let's see: 80-89 (10 numbers), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 4 full sets (each 10 numbers) and one partial set with 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49 occurrences. Wait, but I thought each set is 10 numbers, so 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, etc. So, up to 480-488, which is 9. So, total is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences here. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is every 10th number starting from 4 up to 484. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such sets, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. There are 89 numbers here, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 such numbers.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.

So 484 is the last page with a 4 in the units place. So yes, 49 times. But wait, let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 =49. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's the first set, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, all these ranges are valid. So 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So there are 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full sets we have. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? 488 -480 +1=9 numbers. So total in the tens place: 4 full sets (each 10 numbers) and 9 in the last partial set. So 4x10=40, plus 9=49. So 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think again. The number of times a digit appears in the units place from 1 to n can be calculated by dividing n by 10 and taking the floor, then adding 1 if the units digit is greater than or equal to the digit we're counting. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are and then check the remainder. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence, but wait, 488 is the last page. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48. Because from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then from 481 to 488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the 48th occurrence. So, units place: 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one block. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. But wait, from 400-488, the block is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, each of these contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, in the hundreds place, every number from 400 to 488 has a 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total number of 4's is 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8's appear every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many times? From 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which is 48.8. So, 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, the last number is 488, which is included. So, from 8 to 488, how many 8's in units place? Let's see: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of terms is given by (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's different from the 48 I thought earlier. So, perhaps the correct count is 49. Let me check: The first 8 is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, 8's in the tens place. These occur in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 80-89: yes, that's one block. 180-189: another. 280-289: another. 380-389: another. Now, 480-488: the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4, so 480-488 is another block where the tens digit is 8. But wait, how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place? From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8, so that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). Wait, but earlier blocks have 10 numbers each. So, let's count how many complete blocks there are. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189: 10. 200-299: 280-289: 10. 300-399: 380-389: 10. 400-488: 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, tens place: 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, does 8 appear in the hundreds place? The book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 187. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89. Hmm, but let me check the units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? The first is 4, then 14, 24, ..., up to 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, earlier I thought it was 48, but now this calculation says 49. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate. For units place of 4's: The first occurrence is 4, and the last is 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place for 4's is 49, not 48. That changes things. So, earlier, I thought units place for 4's was 48, but it's actually 49. So, correcting that, the total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4's: 188. Now, 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, so I think I made a mistake in the initial count of 4's in the units place. It should be 49, not 48. So, the correct total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Let me confirm this again. For 4's: units place: from 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units: 49. Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units place: 8, 18, ..., 488. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks has 10 numbers, and the last block has 9 (480-488). So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, units:49, tens:49, total 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** The 4 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). \n     - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n     - Number of blocks: 5 (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n     - Each block contributes 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488.\n     - Number of numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488).\n     - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n     - Number of blocks: 5 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488).\n     - First four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9.\n     - Total: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** The 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book only goes up to 488.\n     - Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188.\n   - Number of 8's: 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, actually, it's 48 numbers from 4 to 480, and then 484 is the 49th. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so the number of 4's in the units place is the number of times 4 appears in each 10-number block. So, for each block of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes one 4, so that's 48. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48. 2. **Tens place:** Now, I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49, 140 to 149, 240 to 249, 340 to 349, and 440 to 449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one range. Then 140-149: that's another. 240-249: another. 340-349: another. 440-449: another. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488. So, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, there are 187 4's in total. Now, I need to count the number of 8's in the same way. Let's go through each digit position again. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. So, how many such numbers? The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of 8's in the units place is equal to the number of complete groups of 10 in 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total units place 8's: 48 (from full groups) +1 (from the partial group) =49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the tens digit is 8 for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers, except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers (480-488). So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) -98 (8's) =89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences. The partial group (481-488) doesn't add a 4 in the units place.  \n   **Total units place 4's:** 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in the tens place for numbers 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges.  \n   **Total tens place 4's:** 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.  \n   **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences. The partial group (481-488) includes 488, adding one more.  \n   **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four ranges each have 10 numbers, and the last has 9.  \n   **Total tens place 8's:** 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.  \n   **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, actually, it's 49 times. Wait, let me check that. From 4 to 484, how many numbers are there? The formula is (last - first) / interval + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 40-49 is 1 block, 140-149 is another, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. Wait, but 400-488 is a range where the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, we're only considering the hundreds place. So, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4, so each contributes one 4. So, that's 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when counting digits, each number contributes one digit in the hundreds place if it's a three-digit number. So, from 400 to 488, each number has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 is another (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, does 480-489 exist? Yes, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would be part of the tens place for 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (since 480,481,...,488). Wait, but in the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, but in this case, 480-489 would be the next block, but we only go up to 488. So, how many numbers in the tens place for 8 in the 400-488 range? From 480-488, that's 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, 480-488 is part of the hundreds digit 4, but the tens digit is 8. So, the tens place for 8 in 400-488 is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, total in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. Wait, but earlier I thought each block is 10, but in the last block, it's only 9. So, total 49 times in the tens place. Wait, but let me double-check. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. This is 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. This is 89 occurrences (from 400 to 488 inclusive).\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. This is 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488. This is 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, the units place has 49 fours. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let's see how many full ranges we have. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10, and so on. The highest such range would be 440-449. After that, the next would be 540-549, but 540 is beyond 488, so we don't count that. So, how many such ranges are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 fours. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number in this range has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so does 488 count? Yes. So, how many such numbers are there? The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges we have. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. And then 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total eights in the tens place: (4 ranges * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from 4 to 484). Wait, let me check that again. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), there's exactly one 4 in the units place. How many such groups are there? The total number of pages is 488, so 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 is included as 484, which is the 48th occurrence.

So, 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.

The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, in the last group (481-488), 488 is included, so that's the 48th occurrence. So, units place 8's: 48. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is valid.

So, the first four ranges each contribute 10 8's, and the last one contributes 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up all the 8's: Units place: 48, Tens place: 49, Hundreds place: 0. Total 8's = 48 + 49 + 0 = 97. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's.

But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last block is 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 484 is the 48th block plus the 4th number in the 48th block. Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is equal to (n // 10) + 1 if the units digit of n is >= d, otherwise just n // 10. Here, n is 488, d is 4. The units digit of 488 is 8, which is greater than 4, so the number of 4's in the units place is 488 // 10 = 48. But wait, does that include all the way up to 484? Let me check: 488 // 10 is 48, so 48 times. So, 48 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, there's one full range where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 4's. From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 4's. From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 4's. From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 4's. From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 4's. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. That's from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, total 4's: 187. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, looking at units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. For example, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers are there? Using the same logic as before, 488 // 10 = 48, and since 488's units digit is 8, which is equal to 8, we add 1 more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 8's. From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 8's. From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 8's. From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 8's. From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers are there here? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, each full range contributes 10 8's, but the last range only contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 full ranges \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 in the last partial range. So, 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 48, tens 50, hundreds 89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 187-98=89. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. When I considered the tens place, I had 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, which is 40, and then 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct. For 4's, in the tens place, I had 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 4's, so 50. That seems correct. Also, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4. So, 89. So, 48+50+89=187. For 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98. So, 187-98=89. Wait, but I just thought of something. When counting the 4's in the units place, I had 48. But wait, when n=488, the units digit is 8, which is greater than 4, so the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10)=48. So, that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in the units place, since the units digit is 8, which is equal to 8, so the count is floor(488/10)+1=48+1=49. That seems right. I think my calculations are correct, so the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, so 48 times.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges, each contributing 10 times, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. With the last number being 488, there are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges contributing 10 each and a partial range (480-488) contributing 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again. The numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms in this sequence can be calculated as ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, how many ranges? From 40-49, that's the first range, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these ranges. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: another 10. 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next, but since the book only goes up to 488, we need to check how many numbers in 480-488 have 8 in the tens place. Wait, 480-489: the tens digit is 8, but our book ends at 488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. Therefore, the ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, total is 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times 8 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the Digit 4:**\n- **Units Place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens Place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds Place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the Digit 8:**\n- **Units Place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens Place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds Place:** 0 occurrences (as pages don't reach 800).\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, that's 484 - 4 = 480, divided by 10 is 48, plus 1 gives 49. Wait, maybe I should think differently. The number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488 can be calculated by considering each block of 10 numbers. Each block contributes exactly one 4 in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the 488th page is 488, which is in the 49th block (481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the 48th block ends at 480, and then 481-488 is the 49th block, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, from 1 to 480, there are 48 fours. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the next 4 would be at 484, which is within this range. So that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, let's look at the tens place. The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, how many such ranges are there? From 0-488, the ranges are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours. So that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check. 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. So that's 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds place. The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours. Wait, but let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-499. But since our book ends at 488, it's 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of fours is 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same method. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many such numbers? From 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So that's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 eights, so 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total fours: 188, total eights: 89. The difference is 188 - 89 = 99. So, there are 99 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

    "text": " So, from 4 to 484, that's 48 intervals of 10, meaning 49 numbers. Wait, no, actually, 484 is the 49th number because 4 is the first, 14 the second, and so on up to 484 being the 49th. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, let's see how many full ranges we have. From 0-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges. Each range has 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50 occurrences. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine.

So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is at 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48. But wait, 488 is the 49th occurrence because 8 is the first, 18 the second, ..., 488 being the 49th. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, let's see how many full ranges we have. From 0-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges. Each has 10 numbers, so 4\u00d710=40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, 89 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 89 (number of 8's) = 99. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting. For the 4's: units place: 4,14,...,484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), 440-449 (10). That's 5 ranges, each with 10, so 50. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488: 488 - 400 +1 = 89. Correct. So total 49+50+89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10). That's 4 ranges, each with 10, so 40. Correct. Hundreds place: 0. So total 49+40=89. Therefore, 188-89=99.

    "text": " So actually, from 4 to 484, that's 484/10 = 48.4, so 48 full decades, but each decade has exactly one 4 in the units place. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. The units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so in each set of 10, there's exactly one 4. So from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th set would end at 480, and then we have 481 to 488, which is 8 more numbers. In those 8 numbers, 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8. So, in the 481-488 range, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the complete sets) plus 1 (from the incomplete set), totaling 49. Wait, that doesn't sound right because 488 is the last page. Let me check: from 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, 481,482,...,488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems correct.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is 10 numbers long. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another range. So that's 5 ranges in total. Each range contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is fully included in 400-488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the hundreds digit can be 4. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nAgain, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48. Then, in the incomplete set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, but the tens digit is 8 only from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many ranges are there? Let's see:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n- 100-199: 180-189 (10)\n- 200-299: 280-289 (10)\n- 300-399: 380-389 (10)\n- 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers, since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, the first four ranges contribute 10 each, and the last one contributes 9. So total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nNow, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place count. For the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 occurrences. So, yes, 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me check again, maybe I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I considered 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place for 4's, from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 49, as calculated.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49, correct.\n\nTens place: 4 ranges of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and 480-488, which is 9. So 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting in ranges, especially for the last partial range, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me confirm the units place for 4's again.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIt's every 10 numbers: 4,14,24,...,484. So, how many terms are there in this sequence?\n\nThe first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is 8 more than 480. So, ((488 -8)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place in 4's: 40-49,140-149, etc., up to 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place in 8's: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. The first four are 10 each, and the last is 9. So 4\u00d710 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place (Ones Place):** The digit '4' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit '8' appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, 28, ..., 488). There are 49 such occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the number of '8's from the number of '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, 484 is the 49th number where 4 appears in the units place. So, actually, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, let me check: from 4 to 484, how many steps of 10? The formula is (last - first)/step + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Yes, that's correct. So, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within the range. Let me count how many sets of ten there are where the tens digit is 4. \n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nSo that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 go up to 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to 4, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see, the last number is 488, so the units digit is 8. How many such numbers? Using the same formula: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place being 8. Let's count:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: 480 is the first, then 481, up to 488. So, 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place occurrences: 4 sets of 10 and 1 set of 9. So, 4x10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me think again. The tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4 times 10 and once 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.

    "text": " So, actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. Wait, let me check that. If I take 488 divided by 10, that's 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then an extra 8 pages. So, from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 48 full times (each cycle being 0-9) plus 8 more numbers. Each cycle has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, 48 cycles give 48 fours, and then in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 fours in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. This happens in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) \u2192 10 fours. 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 fours. 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 fours. 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 fours. 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10 fours. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. But wait, let me make sure that 440-449 is entirely within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, how many 4's is that? 89 fours. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, each of these contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours. Wait, let me check that addition again. 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188. So, total fours are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks are there. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 eights. 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 eights. 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 eights. 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 eights. 400-488: The next would be 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many eights in the tens place here? Each of these 9 numbers contributes an 8 in the tens place, so 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 4 blocks of 10 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, zero eights in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights. So, the number of fours is 188, and the number of eights is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more fours printed than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (480 numbers) plus 8 additional numbers (481-488). Each decade contributes one 4 in the units place, totaling 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are five such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 fours, totaling 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 fours.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\n**Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades plus 8 additional numbers (481-488), contributing 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are four full decades contributing 40 eights, and from 480-488, there are 9 eights in the tens place, totaling 40 + 9 = 49 eights.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98 eights.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, that's 48 numbers because 484 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, no, because 4 is the first, 14 is the second, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, the count is 49. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 // 10) + 1. Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48. But wait, from 1 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? It's every 10 numbers, so 48 full sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Wait, 488 ends with an 8, so the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence because 4 is the first, then every 10 numbers. Wait, let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100. So, in 1-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). In 100-199: 140-149 (10). In 200-299: 240-249 (10). In 300-399: 340-349 (10). In 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 sets of 10, so 5*10=50. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? 449 is less than 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, let me check that again: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) gives 188. Hmm, that seems high, but let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the tens place. Wait, in the tens place, from 40-49 is 10 numbers, then 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. That seems correct. Similarly, units place: every 10 numbers, starting at 4, so 4,14,24,...,484. That's 49 numbers because 484 is the 49th occurrence. And hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, let's count: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, total in tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, that's 49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89: 10. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10=40, plus 9 is 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because 90 seems a big difference. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,24,...,484. How many? Let's see: from 4 to 484, step 10. The formula is ((last - first)/step) + 1. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 488-400+1=89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " So, actually, from 4 to 484, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences. Then, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times in the units place. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding them up: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total number of 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place, each range (40-49, etc.) contributes 10, and there are 5 such ranges, so 50. Units place: every 10 numbers, so from 4,14,...,484. How many? Let's see, 484 divided by 10 is 48.4, so 48 full tens, and then one more at 484, making it 49. So, 49 in units, 50 in tens, 89 in hundreds. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Hmm, okay, so 188 4's. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last number is 488, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. Let me see. So, from 0-99: 80-89 \u219210 numbers. From 100-199:180-189\u219210 numbers. From 200-299:280-289\u219210 numbers. From 300-399:380-389\u219210 numbers. From 400-488:480-488\u21929 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, that's 9 instead of 10. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10, and one range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, hundreds place has 0 occurrences. Now, adding up: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's:49+49=98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, 24, ..., 484).
