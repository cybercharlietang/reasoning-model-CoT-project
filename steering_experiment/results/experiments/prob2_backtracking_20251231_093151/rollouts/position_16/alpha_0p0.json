    "text": " Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 480 / 10 = 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the next number with 4 in the units place would be 494, but 494 is beyond 488. So, actually, the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 49th occurrence. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's correct. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place, such as 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 1-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449 \u2192 10 numbers. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. But wait, let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, tens place: 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, hundreds place: 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many full ranges we have: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. Now, 480-488: how many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above. But since the book is only up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place: 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many hundreds are there? From 0 to 488, we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. That's 5 sets. Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50. But wait, the last set, 400-488, only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is still within that range, right? So, yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Let's check: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). So, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, but let me make sure. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is units + tens: 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with the last range (480-488) contributing 9 numbers.\n   - Total occurrences: 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Total occurrences: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check. The numbers would be 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. From 0 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's calculate it as follows: The number of complete groups of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). Each group contributes one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, does the last group (481-490) include 484? Yes, it does, so the 48th group includes 484. So, the units place has 48 fours. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can also appear in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges contributes 10 fours in the tens place. Let me count how many such ranges there are. From 0-99: 40-49: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 240-249: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 340-349: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 440-449: 10 numbers. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 440-449 is within 488. 449 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, 50 fours in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400 to 488. Each number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place. Now, adding them up: Units place: 48, Tens place: 50, Hundreds place: 89. Total fours = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Wait, 488 is the last page, so the last occurrence is 488. Let me count how many times 8 appears in the units place. The first occurrence is 8, then 18, 28, ..., 488. The number of such numbers is calculated by dividing 488 by 10, which is 48.8. Taking the integer part, that's 48, but wait, does 488 count as the 49th occurrence? Let me see: The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 appears in the units place up to 488. The formula is floor(488/10) = 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. But wait, does the 48th group end at 480, so 488 is the 49th occurrence? Let me check: The first group is 1-10: 8 is at 8. Second group: 11-20: 18. ... 48th group: 471-480: 478. Then 481-490: 488. So, 488 is the 49th occurrence. So, units place: 49 eights. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. Wait, but 488 is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. Let me confirm: The number of 8's in units place from 1 to N is floor((N + 1)/10). Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Let me think: For units digit, the number of times 8 appears is equal to the number of complete decades plus one if the last digit is >=8. So, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete decades, each contributing one 8, and then in the incomplete decade (481-488), 488 has an 8, so that's one more. So total units place: 48 +1=49. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last range is 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place. Each full range (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes 10 eights. Let's see how many full ranges there are. From 0-99: 80-89: 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers. From 400-488: 480-488: How many numbers? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, each of the first four ranges contributes 10 eights, and the last range contributes 9 eights. So total tens place eights: 4\u00d710 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights. Now, adding up the eights: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total eights:49+49=98. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me double-check the tens place. From 0-99:80-89:10 eights. 100-199:180-189:10. 200-299:280-289:10. 300-399:380-389:10. 400-488:480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That's correct. So total eights:49+49=98. Wait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49, and the tens place was 49, so total eights:98. Now, the number of fours was 187, and eights were 98. So, the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours. Units place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10)=48, but since 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence, so 48 fours in the units place. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10 fours, so 5\u00d710=50. Hundreds place:400-488: 488-400+1=89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89 fours. Total fours:48+50+89=187. That seems correct. Eights: Units place:49, Tens place:49, Hundreds place:0. Total eights:98. So, 187 fours minus 98 eights equals 89 more fours. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for eights. Let me check again. Units place for eights: The number of times 8 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. The formula is floor((488 + 1)/10)=floor(489/10)=48.9, which is 48. But wait, that's not correct. Wait, the correct way is to calculate how many times 8 appears in the units place. For each 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial set (481-488), 488 is included, which has an 8. So, total units place eights:48+1=49. That's correct. Similarly, tens place: as before, 49. So, total eights:98. So, the difference is 187-98=89. Therefore, there are 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (4, 14, 24, ..., 484):**\n   - There are 48 occurrences (from 4 to 484, stepping by 10).\n\n2. **Tens Place (40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449):**\n   - Each range contributes 10 fours, and there are 5 such ranges, totaling 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (400-488):**\n   - There are 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1), each with a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 4's:**\n- 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place (8, 18, 28, ..., 488):**\n   - There are 49 occurrences (from 8 to 488, stepping by 10, including 488).\n\n2. **Tens Place (80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488):**\n   - Each full range contributes 10 eights, and the last range contributes 9, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:**\n- 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = **98**\n\n**Difference:**\n- 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **89**\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, every 10th number. So, 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49th occurrence. So, actually, there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is the last one with a 4 in the units place. So yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count each range: - 40-49: that's 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10 numbers, so another 10 4's. - 240-249: 10 more, so 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: 10 as well. Now, let's add them up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's. - 180-189: 10 more. - 280-289: another 10. - 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-489 would be the next set, but the book ends at 488, so 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), so 9 8's in the tens place here. So total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39. Wait, let me check: 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 10+10+10+10+9=49? Wait, no, wait: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So that's 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Hmm, but wait, earlier when I thought about the 4's, the hundreds place was 89, but for 8's, the hundreds place is only up to 488, so let me check. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are there than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, when I was counting the 8's in the tens place, I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, which is correct because from 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place for that range. So, adding up: 10 (80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, 49 8's. So, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. For the 4's, units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. I think that makes sense. Let me just check if I missed any edge cases. For example, in the hundreds place for 4's, does 400 count? Yes, because 400 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, 400-488 is 89 numbers, correct. For the 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's there. So, I think my counts are accurate. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. This gives 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 4's in the tens place. But wait, let me check the last range. 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 numbers. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400 to 488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, the last at 488. So, the number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: Now, this is a bit tricky. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 8, so that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, not 10. So, the first four ranges each have 10 numbers, and the last one has 9. So, total in the tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, the total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n   \n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, and there are 5 such ranges.\n   - Total: 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8) / 10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last range (480-488) contributes 9.\n   - Total: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times that is. Each block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total in tens place is 40 +10=50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +50 +89= 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1= (480)/10 +1=48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1-400, there are 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, we have 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero occurrences in the hundreds place. So, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98. Now, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (number of 4's) -98 (number of 8's)=90.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449. Let's count how many sets there are. Each set is 10 numbers, so for each hundred, there's one set. From 1-99: 40-49 is one set, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149, another 10. From 200-299: 240-249, another 10. From 300-399: 340-349, another 10. From 400-488: 440-449, which is also 10 numbers. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488, so it's okay. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only interested in the hundreds digit, which is 4. So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count each set. From 1-99: 80-89 is one set, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, another 10. From 300-399: 380-389, another 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 numbers. So, total sets: 4 full sets (each 10) and one partial set of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's: units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that's correct. For the 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n1. **Units place (ones place):** 4 appears in numbers like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. That's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's another 10 numbers. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 4 appears 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full decades, each contributing one 8 in the units place, and then the 488 adds another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, that's correct. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8. How many such blocks? From 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place: 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 +1 =9. So, 40 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never is 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 8 appears 98 times. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's see how many complete ranges there are up to 488.

So, how many terms? Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. That's 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but the book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484)\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449)\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (e.g., 400-488)\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488)\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488)\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, for each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full tens, so 48 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page. Let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, meaning 48 full tens, so 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 488 have a 4 in the units place? No, it's 8. So, the last 4 in the units place is 484, which is the 49th occurrence? Wait, no. Let me think again. Each ten has one 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means 48 full tens, so 48 4's in the units place. Wait, but 484 is the 48th occurrence? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me use a formula. The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor(n/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to n is floor((n + 1)/10) if d is 0, but for other digits, it's floor((n)/10) + (1 if the units digit of n is >= d else 0). Wait, maybe it's better to think that for each digit position, the number of times a digit appears is calculated by looking at higher digits and current digits. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider each position separately and calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll consider each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4's:\n\n- For units place, the digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, the last block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, does the 48th block end at 480, and then we have 481-488? So, the units digit 4 would appear at 484, which is within the 481-488 block. So, that's the 49th occurrence? Wait, no, because each block of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last units digit 4 is at 484, which is within the 481-490 block, but since we only go up to 488, it's still part of the 48th block. So, I think it's 48 times.\n\nWait, but let's check: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, the last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Oh, so there are 49 4's in the units place. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. So, the correct count is 49 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The number of terms in the sequence starting at a, ending at l, with common difference d is ((l - a)/d) + 1. So, a=4, l=484, d=10. So, (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, yes, 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 8,18,28,...,488. The first term is 8, last term is 488. Common difference 10. Number of terms: (488 -8)/10 +1= 480/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so it's included. So, both 4's and 8's in the units place occur 49 times each? Wait, but earlier for 4's, I thought 484 is the last 4 in the units place, which is within 481-490, but since we stop at 488, does that affect the count? No, because 484 is less than 488, so it's included. So, 49 4's in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check the last page: 488. The units digit is 8, so that's included in the count for 8's. So, yes, both 4's and 8's have 49 occurrences in the units place.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought 488/10=48.8, so 48 full blocks, but the formula gives 49. So, I think the formula is correct because when you have n=488, the number of times a digit appears in the units place is floor((n + 1)/10) if the digit is 0, but for other digits, it's floor((n)/10) + (1 if the units digit is >= d else 0). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's stick with the sequence approach, which gave 49 for both 4's and 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check with a smaller number to see if this approach is correct. Suppose n=14. How many 4's in the units place? 4 and 14, so two 4's. Using the formula: (14 -4)/10 +1= (10)/10 +1=1+1=2. Correct. Similarly, for n=18, 8's in units place: 8 and 18, so two 8's. So, formula works. So, for n=488, it's 49 for both 4's and 8's in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for 4's. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last set is 440-449, and then 480-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488.\n\nWait, no. Actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488.\n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, that's 4*10=40 times.\n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 times. So, total 40+10=50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49: 10 numbers, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349:10, and 440-449:10. So, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50. But wait, 400-488 is only up to 488, so does 440-449 fall within that? Yes, because 449 < 488. So, yes, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 50 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400-488 is part of the fifth hundred, but actually, 400-488 is part of the 400s, which is the fifth hundred if we start counting from 0. But regardless, the count is 5 sets of 10, so 50 times.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each complete hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributes 10 occurrences. So, from 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm. From 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 -400 +1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, the hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 4's and 8's.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is number of 4's minus number of 8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49 (correct, as per the sequence)\n- Tens: 50 (correct, 5 sets of 10)\n- Hundreds: 89 (correct, from 400-488 inclusive)\nTotal: 49+50=99; 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49 (correct)\n- Tens: 49 (correct, 4 sets of 10 and 9 in the last set)\n- Hundreds: 0 (correct)\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Earlier, I thought it was 49, but let me confirm again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1= (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8's: 8,18,28,...,488. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: 50 times, correct.\n\nTens place for 8's: 49 times, correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: 89 times, correct.\n\nHundreds place for 8's: 0 times, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. From 40-49:10, 140-149:10, 240-249:10, 340-349:10, 440-449:10. That's five sets, each contributing 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484. This is an arithmetic sequence with 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8,18,28,...,488. This is an arithmetic sequence with 49 terms.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any hundreds place up to 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Each step is 10, so starting from 4, the nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10. Setting this equal to 484: 4 + 10(n-1) = 484 \u2192 10(n-1) = 480 \u2192 n-1 = 48 \u2192 n=49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such groups there are. Each group has 10 numbers. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So, that's 5 groups, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, all these groups are within the 488-page limit. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. The nth term is 8 + (n-1)*10. Setting equal to 488: 8 + 10(n-1) = 488 \u2192 10(n-1)=480 \u2192 n-1=48 \u2192 n=49. So, 49 occurrences. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: from 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189: another 10, 280-289: another 10, 380-389: another 10. So, that's 4 groups, each with 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 occurrences. Now, check if 480-489 is within the page limit. 480-489 would be another group, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. So, do I count 9 or 10? Wait, the tens digit is 8, so in 480-489, the tens digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the 8 appears 9 times in the 480-488 range. So, total in tens place: 4 groups of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so total 49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 4 groups, but now adding 9 more. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the hundreds place as well, but in terms of tens place, it's 8. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book has only 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's: 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. These numbers would be from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. From 140-149: another 10. From 240-249: another 10. From 340-349: another 10. From 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place. These would be numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's here. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. How many terms? Let's compute ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49.

Let's check each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10 numbers. - 280-289: 10 numbers. - 380-389: 10 numbers. - 480-488: How many numbers? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4 ranges with 10 each, and one range with 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This sequence has 49 terms.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449, totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488, totaling 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No 8's as page numbers don't exceed 488.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each subsequent 4 in the units place is 10 numbers apart. So, from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for a block of 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last block would be 440-449. Let me count how many full blocks there are. From 0-99: 40-49 is one block, that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another block, another 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 * 10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, how many times does the hundreds digit equal 4? For each number from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me check: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks. From 0-99: 80-89 is one block, 10 numbers. Then 180-189, another block, 10 numbers. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So that's 5 blocks, but the last block is only 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but in the tens place, each block is 10 numbers, so the full blocks are up to 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, we have 9 numbers in the last block. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (each contributing 10 numbers) and one partial block contributing 9 numbers. Wait, no. Let me think again. The blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So that's 4 full blocks and one partial. So, the total for the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: from 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but I'm a bit unsure about the tens place for 8's. Let me recount the tens place for 8's. The blocks are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. That seems correct. So, the difference is 90. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to confirm. Alternatively, I can think of the number of digits in each position and calculate the occurrences. For units place: in 1-488, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last one if 488 isn't a multiple of 10. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so each digit 0-9 appears 48 times, but the last digit (8) appears one extra time because 488 is the last number. Wait, but actually, for units place, the number of times each digit appears from 1 to N can be calculated as floor(N/10) + (1 if the last digit is >= the digit). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, for units place, the number of 4's is floor(488/10) = 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 in the units place, plus if the last partial decade has a 4, which it does at 484, so 49 times. Similarly for 8's, it's 48 full decades, each contributing one 8, and the last partial decade (480-488) has an 8 at 488, so 49 times. So that matches what I had before. For tens place: For 4's, each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 0-99: 40-49 (10). 100-199: 140-149 (10). 200-299: 240-249 (10). 300-399: 340-349 (10). 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 times. For 8's in the tens place: 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, 4 full blocks and one partial, totaling 49. So, that's correct. For hundreds place: 4's appear from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8's don't appear in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488. So, 0 times. So, adding up, 4's: 49+50+89=188. 8's: 49+49+0=98. Difference: 188-98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digit '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me check: 4,14,24,...,484. That's from 4 to 484 with a common difference of 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's see how many full sets of 100 there are. From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, for hundreds 0,1,2,3,4 (but 4 only goes up to 488, not 499). Wait, let me clarify: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then in 140-149, another 10, and so on. How many such sets are there? From 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, but the last set (440-449) is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 sets (hundreds 0,1,2,3,4). Each set contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's okay. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers, but the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 occurrences. So total 4's are 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48, plus 1 is 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many sets there are. Each hundred has one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, from hundreds 0,1,2,3,4. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so in the hundreds place, 4, the tens digit can be 8 up to 488. So, how many full sets? Let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: another 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389: 10, and 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, but the units digit goes up to 8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so in the hundreds place 4, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the first four sets (hundreds 0,1,2,3) each have 10 numbers, and the last set (hundreds 4) has 9 numbers. So, total in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 40 +9=49. Wait, no, let me think again. From hundreds 0: 80-89: 10 numbers. Hundreds 1: 180-189:10. Hundreds 2:280-289:10. Hundreds 3:380-389:10. Hundreds 4:480-488:9. So total is 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) equals 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188-98 is 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through the 4's again: units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. For 8's: units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, that seems correct. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4. So, 89 occurrences. That seems correct. And in the tens place for 4's, we had 50 occurrences. Units place 49. So, total 188. For 8's, units and tens each had 49, so 98 total. So, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4,14,24,...,484.

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are.

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. But wait, the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Each number here has a hundreds digit of 4. The range is 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 +50=99, 99+89=188. So, total 4's printed are 188. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's find how many such numbers. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's count how many such ranges there are.

So, instead of 10, we have 9 here. So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 +9=49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0)=49+49=98. So, total 8's printed are 98.

But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 +89=188. So, total 4's: 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1 =48 +1=49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. How many such ranges? - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189:10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. But wait, does 480-489 have an 8 in the tens place? Yes, 480-489, but the book only goes up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, instead of 10, it's 9. Therefore, the total for the tens place is 4*10 +9=40+9=49. Wait, no, because 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, so that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, and then 480-488 contributing 9. So total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 8's:98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers, from 4 to 484. This gives:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (including 440-449), each contributing 10 numbers:\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 10 = 50 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in numbers 400-488, which is:\n   \\[\n   488 - 400 + 1 = 89 \\text{ times}\n   \\]\n   Total 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\)\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers, from 8 to 488.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, the last block is only up to 488, so the tens digit in 400-488 can be 4 for 400-409, 410-419, ..., 440-449. So, how many complete hundreds are there? Up to 400, which is four complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, and 488 is beyond that, so yes, 5 blocks. So total in tens place is 40 (from 0-399) + 50 (from 400-488) = 90. Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 numbers (400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers, but when considering the tens digit, each block is 10 numbers, so 400-409 is 10, 410-419 is another 10, etc., up to 440-449. So, from 400-449, that's 5 blocks, each with 10, so 50. Then from 450-488, the tens digit is 5,6,7,8, so no more 4's in the tens place. So, total in tens place is 40 + 50 = 90. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (90) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 90 = 139 + 89 = 228. So, 228 fours. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for 8's: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many? The last one is 488, so (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So, 49 times in units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Let's see how many such blocks we have. From 0-99: 80-89, which is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189, another 10. From 200-299: 280-289, 10. From 300-399: 380-389, 10. From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, the digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, for the tens place: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial block of 9 (480-488). So, total in tens place is 4*10 +9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 times in tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 eights. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 228 fours - 98 eights = 130. Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For fours: units 49, tens 90, hundreds 89. 49+90=139, 139+89=228. For eights: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. 228-98=130. So, the answer should be 130 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 4, 14, ..., 484).

There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 90 + 89 = 228.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears every 10 numbers (e.g., 8, 18, ..., 488). There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., and in 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 228 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 130.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{130}"

    "text": " Let me check: starting at 4, each 10 numbers give one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, the number of 4's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But 48*10 = 480, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484. So yes, 48 times. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers) From 100-199: 140-149 (10) From 200-299: 240-249 (10) From 300-399: 340-349 (10) From 400-488: 440-449 (10) Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's. So 5*10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. So total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so floor is 48. But wait, 48*10 = 480, so the last 8 in the units place is at 488. So that's 49 times? Wait, no, because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Let me think: starting at 8, each 10 numbers gives one 8 in the units place. So from 1 to 488, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 488 is included, it's actually 49. Wait, let me check: 8,18,...,488. The number of terms is (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are within 488. 80-89: yes, that's 10 numbers. 180-189: yes, another 10. 280-289: yes, another 10. 380-389: yes, another 10. 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So in the hundreds place, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So total in tens place: 4 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 9. So 4*10 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 8's in the tens place. So total is 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 187 -98=89. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: units=48, tens=50, hundreds=89. 48+50=98, 98+89=187. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. So 187-98=89. Hmm, that seems correct.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 appears in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 10 per hundred. Now, how many hundreds are there? From 1 to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. So, in each hundred, the 40-49 range contributes 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4 times 10, which is 40. But wait, in the 400-488 range, the tens place is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10. So, actually, it's 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, no, because 400-488 includes the 440-449 range, so that's an extra 10. So, from 1-400, it's 4 times 10 (40-49, 140-149, etc.) which is 40, plus 10 from 440-449, making it 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, there are 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so taking the integer part, 48, but including both 8 and 488, so it's 49 numbers. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. Now, how many such ranges are there up to 488? From 1-400, there are 4 such ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, in the 400-488 range, does the tens place ever have an 8? Let's see: 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 480-488, there are 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's are units (49) + tens (49) = 98. Now, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

Let me count these. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. Similarly, 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488. So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but does 449 count? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers. So, 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first is 8, the last is 488. Let me calculate how many: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, but does 480-489 count? Since the book only goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10). From 100-199: 180-189 (10). From 200-299: 280-289 (10). From 300-399: 380-389 (10). From 400-488: 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, we have 4 sets of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 occurrences of the digit 8. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. There are 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488. There are 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. There are 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear since the book ends at 488. There are 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. So, the number of 4's in the units place is 49. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But in the hundreds place, the digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, that's 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, how many numbers? (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see: From 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). Now, from 400-488: The next block would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds place starting with 4, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the total in the tens place is 4 blocks of 10 (40) and 9, so 40 +9=49 times. Wait, let me check: 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, and 400-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98 times. Wait, that seems correct? Let me double-check the tens place for 400-488. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9, not 10. So, total in tens place is 4*10 +9=49. So, 8's are 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 10 per range. How many ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 is one range. From 100-199: 140-149 is another. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. So, 5 ranges \u00d7 10 numbers each = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Wait, but the last range is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, in the hundreds place, each number contributes one 4. So, that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check: 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, hundreds. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 80-89 is one. From 100-199: 180-189 is another. Similarly, 280-289 and 380-389. That's 4 ranges. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences in the tens place. Wait, but let me check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 would be part of the hundreds place. But in the tens place, 480-489 would have 8 in the tens place, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Wait, no, because when we're looking at the tens place, 480-489 is a range where the tens digit is 8, but since the book ends at 488, the numbers 480-488 have 8 in the tens place, but the units digit varies from 0 to 8. So, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but earlier I thought of ranges like 80-89, which are 10 numbers. But in the case of 480-488, it's only 9 numbers because 489 isn't included. Hmm, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me recast this. For the tens place, how many times does 8 appear? It's in ranges where the tens digit is 8, which are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's 5 ranges, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, first four ranges: each has 10 numbers, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers. So, total is 40 + 9 = 49 occurrences in the tens place. Wait, that seems different from my initial thought. Let me verify: For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89). But in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4 hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contributing 10 numbers, and the last hundred (400-488) contributing 9 numbers. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 occurrences of 8. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I counted 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50 occurrences. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had 5 ranges but the last one only had 9 numbers, so 4\u00d710 +9=49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, units place: 4,14,...,484. The count is 49, as calculated. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. That's also 49 numbers, since 488 is included.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included in the units place count for 8's. So, yes, 49 units place 8's.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 8's in the tens place, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, in the hundreds place for 4's, I counted 89 numbers from 400-488. Let me check that again. 400 is the first page with a hundreds digit of 4, and 488 is the last. So, the count is 488 -400 +1=89. Correct.\n\nBut for the 8's, in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 there.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as having 8 in the tens place, which is correct because 480 has 8 in the tens place, and so does 481, etc., up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, as I thought.\n\nWait, but I'm now thinking, when counting the tens place for 8's, does 480-488 include 9 numbers? Let me list them: 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the 4's count. Wait, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm thinking, maybe I should check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 -400 +1=89. Correct.\n\nWait, but another way to think about it: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my counts are accurate.\n\nThus, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the 8's tens place count. Let me recount.\n\nIn the tens place, 8 can appear in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, that's 4 full ranges of 10, and one partial range of 9. So, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the 4's tens place, I had 5 ranges: 40-49, 140-149, etc., each with 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nSo, yes, 188 vs 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: the problem says \"how many more 4's are printed than 8's.\" So, 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations now.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 occurrences (including 480-488).\n3. **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, the step is 10. So, the number of terms is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, the last block with a 4 in the tens place is 440-449. How many such blocks are there? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, there are 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. Let's count how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does it go up to 480-489? But the book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the blocks. 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, how many 8's in the tens place? For the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, the last block, 480-488, contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. Therefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each 10 numbers add one more 4 in the units place. So, 4 is the 1st, 14 is the 2nd, ..., 484 is the 49th. So, actually, there are 49 times where 4 appears in the units place. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as (488 divided by 10) rounded up to the nearest whole number. 488 / 10 = 48.8, which rounds up to 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time it occurs. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set would be 440-449. Let me count how many such sets there are. Starting from 40-49: that's one set of 10 numbers. Then 140-149, another set. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 sets in total. Each set contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. Therefore, the total number of 4's is the sum of the units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Now, let me count the number of 8's using the same approach. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers, like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many times this happens. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, which rounds up to 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers each time. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, 480-489 would be another set, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 480-488. Let me count the sets: 80-89 is one set (10 numbers), 180-189 is another, 280-289 is another, 380-389 is another. That's 4 sets, each contributing 10 numbers. However, the last set, 480-489, only goes up to 488, so instead of 10 numbers, it's 9 numbers (480-488). So, total for the tens place: 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40, plus the 9 numbers in 480-488, totaling 49 times. Wait, no, actually, 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the hundreds place that have 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Therefore, total number of 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations. For 4's: Units: 49, Tens: 50, Hundreds: 89. Total: 49+50=99, 99+89=188. That seems correct. For 8's: Units: 49, Tens: 49. Total: 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had 5 sets: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each set is 10 numbers, so 5\u00d710=50. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) which is 4\u00d710=40, plus 480-488 which is 9 numbers, totaling 49. So, 49 in the tens place for 8's. Units place for 8's: 488/10=48.8, so 49 numbers. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the tens place. This happens in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such ranges there are up to 488. The first is 40-49, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place starting from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's find how many times. The last occurrence is at 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each range has 10 numbers. Let's see how many such ranges exist up to 488. The first is 80-89, then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. Wait, but 480-489 would be another range, but since the book only goes up to 488, the 8 in the tens place would be from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, not 10. So, I need to adjust for that. So, the first three ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 4*10=40, but the last part, 480-488, contributes 9. So total in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So total is 4*10 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. Units place: 8,18,28,...,488. How many? The last one is 488. So, starting at 8, each step of 10. So, (488 -8)/10 +1 = (480)/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place: As above, 49 times. So total 8's: 49+49=98. Now, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. How many such blocks are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 240-249 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 340-349 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 440-449 (10 numbers). Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place only in the numbers 400-488. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4. How many such numbers are there? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 = 480/10 = 48. Then, adding 1 gives 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in blocks of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each block from 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 180-189 (10 numbers). From 200-299: 280-289 (10 numbers). From 300-399: 380-389 (10 numbers). From 400-488: 480-488. Now, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, in the hundreds place, the 8's in the tens place occur in 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Let's count how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then 140-149 is another 10, and so on. The last block before 488 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers. How many blocks are there? From 0 to 4 in the hundreds place, but since 488 is the limit, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, but 440-449 is within 488. So, there are 5 blocks (0-4 in hundreds place). But wait, the first block is 40-49, which is in the hundreds place 0. Then 140-149 (hundreds digit 1), 240-249 (2), 340-349 (3), 440-449 (4). That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first occurrence is 8, the last is 488. Using the formula: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block has 10 numbers. Let's see how many blocks there are. The first block is 80-89 (hundreds digit 0), then 180-189 (1), 280-289 (2), 380-389 (3). The next would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only go up to 488. So, how many full blocks are there? 0-3 in the hundreds place, so 4 blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. However, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, but only from 480 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9 numbers. So, instead of 10, we have 9. Therefore, total in the tens place: 40 (from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 49. Wait, let me check that again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 180-189: 10, 280-289: 10, 380-389:10. That's 4 blocks, each with 10, so 40. Then, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, so numbers 480, 481, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.

From 100-199: 140-149. From 200-299: 240-249. From 300-399: 340-349. From 400-488: 440-449. That's a total of 5 ranges. Each range contributes 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50 times. Wait, but the last range is 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can also appear in the hundreds place. That would be from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, the 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence in the units place is at 488. Let's calculate how many times. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these ranges. From 0-99: 80-89 is one range, 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189. From 200-299: 280-289. From 300-399: 380-389. From 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, for the last range, instead of 10 numbers, we have 9. So, let's adjust. The first four ranges each contribute 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9. So, total in tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times. Now, adding up the occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. This is 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in any page number.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Let me check: from 4 to 484, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so actually, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? There are 4 complete blocks: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range. So, in each of the first four blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), there's one set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 4 sets \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only concerned with the hundreds digit, which is 4 for all these numbers. So, there are 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is at 488. So, how many numbers is that? Starting from 8, each step is +10. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's check if 480-489 is included, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of the 480-488 range. So, how many sets of 10 numbers with tens digit 8 are there? Each block of 100 has one such set, so from 1-400, there are 4 sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 numbers. That's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for these 9 numbers. Therefore, total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears every 10 numbers: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of 4's: \\( \\frac{484 - 4}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 440-449 adds another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, contributing 89 occurrences (488 - 400 + 1).\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of 8's: \\( \\frac{488 - 8}{10} + 1 = 49 \\).\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488.\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In 400-488, 480-488 adds 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the next is 140-149 (another 10), then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 include 444, which we've already counted in the units place? No, because we're counting the tens place separately. So, total 50. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of 4. Now, let's count the number of 8's in the same way. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is 8, and the last is 488. To find how many, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such blocks are there. The first block is 80-89 (10 numbers), then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes 10 numbers. So, that's 4 blocks, 4*10=40. Wait, but 380-389 is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So, 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 occurrences. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 49 +40=89. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) -89 (number of 8's) =99.

So, there are 49 occurrences of 4 in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

Then, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has another 10 numbers. How many hundreds do we have? Up to 488, so up to the 400s. So, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 * 10 = 50 occurrences. But wait, does 440-449 go beyond 488? No, because 449 is less than 488. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Now, adding them all up: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. Using the same method as before: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers. How many such ranges are there? From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then, each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has another 10 numbers. Up to 380-389, because 480-489 would be in the 400s, but 488 is the last page. So, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's 4 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place contributes 0. Adding them up: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (0) = 89. So, there are 89 eights in total.

    "text": " Let me think. From 4 to 484, that's every 10 numbers. So, starting at 4, the next is 14, 24, ..., 484. The total number is (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers, specifically in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. How many such ranges are there? From 0-99: 40-49 (10 numbers). From 100-199: 140-149 (10). From 200-299: 240-249 (10). From 300-399: 340-349 (10). From 400-488: 440-449 (10). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times. Wait, no, actually, each number from 400 to 488 has 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears. Now, let's do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** The 8 appears every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's see how many there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488. Let's count each range: - 80-89: 10 numbers. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, total in tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9, so 4*10 +9=49. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the hundreds place of 4's. When I counted 4's in the hundreds place, I took 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct. For 8's in the tens place, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 49 total. That seems right. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, yes. So, 49 8's in the tens place. Units place for 8's is 49, so total 98. For 4's, units place is 49, tens is 50, hundreds is 89, total 188. So, 188 -98=90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's. Wait, but let me check another way. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let's see: from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. For the tens place of 4's, I had 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 50. Units place: 4,14,...,484. That's 484/10=48.4, so 49 numbers. So, 49+50+89=188. For 8's, units place: 8,18,...,488. 488-8=480, 480/10=48, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), 480-488 (9). So, 4*10=40, plus 9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90.

    "text": " Let me check. From 4 to 484, stepping by 10, that's (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, since the book goes up to 488, the last block is 400-488. How many complete blocks of 100 are there? There are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 400-488. In each of the first four blocks, there's a 40-49 section, so that's 4 sections, each contributing 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-409, 410-419, etc., but wait, no. Wait, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, 410-419, ..., but actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, and 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. So, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear in 400-488? Let's see, each hundred block (like 400-499) would have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (400-409, 410-419, etc.), but since we're only going up to 488, let's count how many full tens blocks we have. From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439, 440-449, 450-459, 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. Wait, but the tens digit is 4 only in the blocks where the tens digit is 4, which would be 400-409, 410-419, etc., but actually, no, the tens digit is 4 only in 400-409, 410-419, etc., but each of these blocks is 10 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409 (tens digit 0), wait no, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct this. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, in 400-409, the tens digit is 0. In 410-419, it's 1, and so on up to 480-489, where the tens digit is 8. So, in the range 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in the block 440-449, because the tens digit is 4. So, from 400-488, how many times does the tens digit 4 appear? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, there are 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 4 (from the first four hundreds) * 10 = 40, plus 10 from 440-449, totaling 50. Wait, but wait, the first four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each have a 40-49 block, which is 10 numbers each, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 40 +10=50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 +1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units place 49, tens place 50, hundreds place 89. Total 4's = 49 +50 +89 = 188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit position. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, the last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, stepping by 10. The number of terms is ((488 -8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers, except possibly the last one if it's cut off. Let's see: - 80-89: 10 numbers - 180-189: 10 - 280-289:10 - 380-389:10 - 480-488: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488-480=8, so 8+1=9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but only 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. Total 8's = 49 +49 +0=98. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4 appears in 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences, totaling 5 blocks (including 440-449 within 400-488).\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8 appears in 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - The first four blocks contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - 480-488 contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, the last set is 440-449. Let me count each set: - 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place. - 140-149: another 10. - 240-249: another 10. - 340-349: another 10. - 440-449: another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, there are 89 4's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit position. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in numbers like 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many there are. The first is 8, and the last is 488. So, (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 +1 = 48 +1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Wait, does 480-489 count? Since the book goes up to 488, 480-488 is part of it. So, let's count: - 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's. - 180-189: 10. - 280-289: 10. - 380-389: 10. - 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 8's in the tens place. Adding these up: 10 +10 +10 +10 +9 = 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can only appear in the hundreds place if the number is 800 or above. But since the book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the 4's: units place was 49, tens 50, hundreds 89, totaling 188. For the 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, totaling 98. 188 - 98 is indeed 90.

    "text": " Let me check: starting from 4, each 10 numbers gives one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 480, that's 480/10 = 48 times. Then, 484 is the 49th occurrence. So, total 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many such sets there are. From 40-49: 10 numbers. Then, each subsequent hundred has another 10, so 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 sets in total (including 40-49). So, 5 sets \u00d7 10 numbers = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488? Yes, so that's fine. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. That's how many numbers? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But we're only interested in how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is once for each number in that range. So, 89 times. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 4,14,...,484: from 4 to 484, step 10. The number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct. Tens place: each hundred has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many hundreds? 400-488 is the hundreds place, so 400-499 would be 5 hundreds, but since we only go up to 488, the hundreds place is 4 for all numbers from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But wait, for the tens place, it's not just the hundreds place, but each hundred block. So, in each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, how many complete hundred blocks are there? Up to 400, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (400-409, but 400 is already counted, so 401-410? Wait, no. Actually, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 400-409, which is 10 numbers, but 400 is already counted in the hundreds place. Wait, no, the tens digit in 400 is 0, so the tens digit is 4 in 400-409? No, wait, 400 has tens digit 0, 401 has tens digit 0, 410 has tens digit 1. Wait, no, 400-409 have tens digit 0, 410-419 have tens digit 1, etc. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's: 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contributing 10, so 4\u00d710=40, plus 10 from 440-449, total 50. That matches the earlier count. So, units:49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Total 4's: 49+50+89=188. Now, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8,18,28,...,488. How many such numbers? The first is 8, last is 488. So, from 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) +1=48+1=49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488. So, how many sets? From 80-89: 10 numbers. Then 180-189, 280-289, 380-389: each 10 numbers. That's 4 sets. But the last set, 480-488, is only 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, for each hundred block, except the last one, we have 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place. So, up to 480-488, which is part of the 400-488 range. So, let's see: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189:10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. 480-488:9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total tens place 8's: 10+10+10+10+9=49. Wait, but let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10\u00d74=40 plus 9=49. Correct. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Wait, but let me double-check the counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Correct. For 8's: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. 49+49=98. Correct. So, 188-98=90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.

So, that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10 = 50 times. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, so 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** Now, the 4 can appear in the hundreds place. This happens in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's. Now, let me do the same for 8's. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Let's see how many there are. (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = (480)/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49 times. Wait, but 488 is included, so yes, 49 times. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last range. Let's count each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10. 280-289: 10. 380-389: 10. 480-488: that's 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times. Wait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10*4 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800 or above, but since the book only has 488 pages, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98. So, there are 98 8's. Now, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount. Let me go through the 4's again: units place: 4,14,...,484. That's (484-4)/10 +1=48.4, so 49 numbers. Tens place: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 5*10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers. So, 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units place: 8,18,...,488. (488-8)/10 +1=49. Tens place: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. 4 ranges of 10 and one of 9: 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the units place for 4's. Let me check: from 4 to 484, how many numbers with 4 in units place? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. The number of terms is ((484 -4)/10)+1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So that's correct. Similarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,...,488. The last term is 488, which is included. So, (488-8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct. Tens place for 4's: 40-49,140-149,...,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each 10 numbers: 5*10=50. Correct. Tens place for 8's: 80-89,180-189,...,480-488. So, 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. Correct. Hundreds place: 400-488 for 4's: 89 numbers. For 8's, hundreds place: none, since 800>488. So, 0. So, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 4, 14, 24, ..., 484.\n   - Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n   - Each range contributes 10 numbers, totaling 5 ranges \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Ranges: 400-488.\n   - Number of terms: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):**\n   - 8, 18, 28, ..., 488.\n   - Number of terms: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Ranges: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488.\n   - Each of the first four ranges contributes 10 numbers, and the last contributes 9, totaling 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in the 800s, so 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **90**.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Let me check: 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. The difference between each is 10, so the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, there are 49 4's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count how many times this happens. From 0-99: 40-49 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 140-149 is another 10. From 200-299: 240-249 is another 10. From 300-399: 340-349 is another 10. From 400-488: 440-449 is another 10. So that's 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 4's in the tens place. Wait, but does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's, so 50 in total. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up the 4's from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 4's in total. Now, let me do the same for the digit 8. 1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, the 8's in the units place occur every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. The last occurrence is 488, which is the units place. So, how many terms? Let's calculate: ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's see how many such sets there are. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 is another 10. From 200-299: 280-289 is another 10. From 300-399: 380-389 is another 10. Now, from 400-488: The next set would be 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, we have 9 here. Therefore, the tens place 8's are: 10 (from 80-89) + 10 (180-189) + 10 (280-289) + 10 (380-389) + 9 (480-488) = 10+10+10+10+9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. Now, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449 \u2192 50 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n**Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n**Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Each of these ranges has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. Let's count how many such ranges there are. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Then 140-149: another 10. 240-249: another 10. 340-349: another 10. 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So that's 5 ranges, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is less than 488, so yes, all 10 numbers are included. So, 50 4's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.

Let's see how many there are. The first occurrence is at 8, and the last is at 488. Using the same method as before: (488 - 8)/10 + 1 = 480/10 + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 8's in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place for numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place for 8. Let me check each range: 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10 numbers. 280-289: 10 numbers. 380-389: 10 numbers. 480-488: how many numbers? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total in the tens place: 4 ranges of 10 and 1 range of 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49. So, 49 8's in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is 800 or above, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place. Adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 4 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Let's count these ranges. From 40-49: that's 10 numbers. Similarly, each hundred has another 10 numbers. So, for 40-49: 10, 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is valid, but 540-549 would be beyond 488, so we don't include that. So, how many sets of 10 are there? From 40-49: 10, then 140-149: 10, 240-249: 10, 340-349: 10, and 440-449: 10. That's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. But wait, in the hundreds place, 440-449 is within 488, so it's valid. So, 50 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place in numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times. Now, adding up the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total. Now, let me count the number of 8's. Again, I'll check each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds. 1. **Units place (ones place):** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let me find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 times in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count these. From 80-89: 10 numbers. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, because 488 - 480 = 8, plus 1 is 9). So, total in tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10*4=40 +9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place. Now, adding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, 98 8's in total. Now, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. Wait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. 49+50=99, +89=188. For 8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49+49=98. So, 188-98=90. Hmm, but wait, in the tens place for 4's, I counted 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 4's, so 5*10=50. But let me check if 440-449 is included. Since the book goes up to 488, 440-449 is within range, so yes, that's correct. For 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's correct.

So, that's 5 sets of 10, which is 50 occurrences. But wait, 440-449 is only up to 449, which is within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 4 can appear in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 occurrences. Now, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me compute that: 49 + 50 = 99, and 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total. Now, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place. 1. **Units place:** The 8 can appear in the units place every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., up to 488. Let's find how many such numbers there are. The first is 8, the last is 488. The number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, 49 occurrences in the units place. 2. **Tens place:** The 8 can appear in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Let's count these. From 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers. From 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers. From 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers. From 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers. Now, from 400-488: 480-489 would be the next, but since the book ends at 488, we only have 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4 sets of 10 (40) plus 9, which is 49. Wait, let me check: 80-89 is 10, 180-189 is 10, 280-289 is 10, 380-389 is 10, and 480-488 is 9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 occurrences in the tens place. 3. **Hundreds place:** The 8 can appear in the hundreds place only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place. Now, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total. Now, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recount the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 4,14,...,484. From 4 to 484, step 10. Number of terms: ((484 - 4)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 numbers, 5 sets, so 50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488. That's 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. Number of terms: ((488-8)/10)+1=480/10+1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. The first four sets are 10 each, so 40. The last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me just think if there's another way to approach this, maybe by considering each digit position separately and ensuring I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to check is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so total units place 4's: floor(488/10) = 48 full tens, but since 488 is the last number, and 488 mod 10 is 8, which is less than 4, so the number of 4's in units place is 48 + 1 if 48*10 +4 <=488. 48*10 +4=484, which is <=488, so 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 48 full tens, and 488 is included, so 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- 4's: each block of 100 has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So, 400/100=4 full blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10. So total 50. Wait, but earlier I thought 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. The first four are 10 each, so 40, and the last is 9, so total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Correct.\n\n- 8's: no numbers, since 800-899 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, the counts seem accurate. Therefore, the difference is indeed 90. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each range has 10 numbers, totaling 50.\n3. **Hundreds place:** 400-488. This range has 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. There are 49 occurrences.\n2. **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. The first four ranges have 10 each, and the last has 9, totaling 49.\n3. **Hundreds place:** No occurrences since page numbers don't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"
