After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once. Similarly, from 11-20, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again. \n\nSo, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. Each complete block contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the number of 8's would also be 48. \n\nBut wait, we have those extra 8 pages beyond the 480th page. So, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra 8 pages, the units digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, the units place contributes equally to both digits, 49 each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 0-9, the tens digit is 0, from 10-19 it's 1, and so on up to 90-99 where it's 9. \n\nTo find how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place, I need to figure out how many full decades (100 pages) we have and then handle any remaining pages beyond that. \n\nWait, actually, since the book only has 488 pages, we don't have a full 500 pages. Let me think. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). Similarly, from 101-200, the tens digit cycles again, and so on.\n\nSo, first, let's calculate how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. \n\nTherefore, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's, so 40 each.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining 88 pages from 401 to 488. The tens digit in these pages will cycle through 0-9 as well, but only for 88 pages. Let's see how many full tens are there in 88 pages. \n\n88 divided by 10 is 8.8, so there are 8 complete tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480) and an extra 8 pages (481-488). \n\nIn each of these 8 complete tens, the tens digit cycles through 0-9, but since we're starting at 401, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 7 (471-480). So, the tens digit 4 appears in the 441-450 range, which is one of these 8 complete tens. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... 441-450, tens digit is 4; 451-460, tens digit is 5; 461-470, tens digit is 6; 471-480, tens digit is 7. So, in these 8 complete tens, the tens digit 4 appears exactly once, from 441-450, contributing 10 instances. Similarly, the tens digit 8 would appear in the 481-490 range, but since we only go up to 488, we don't have a full 481-490. So, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the tens digit is 8 for all of them because 481-488 is 480 + 1 to 480 + 8, so the tens digit is 8 for each of these 8 pages. \n\nWait, but 481 is 4 8 1, so the tens digit is 8, right? So, in the extra 8 pages beyond 480, the tens digit is 8 for all 8 pages. Therefore, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in these extra pages.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the tens place: in the 4 complete hundreds, we have 40 instances of 4 and 40 instances of 8. In the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 instances of 4 (from 441-450) and 8 instances of 8 (from 481-488). Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. Because in the 401-488 range, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 7 (471-480), and then 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears only once in the 441-450 block, which is 10 pages, so 10 instances. The digit 8 appears in the 481-488 block, which is 8 pages, so 8 instances. So, yes, that seems correct. So, tens place: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0, but we don't count leading zeros. So, only from 100 onwards do we have a hundreds digit.\n\nIn the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, 100 times.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, 100 times.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, and the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, wait, that can't be right because 188 - 97 is 91, which seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again because maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me start by recounting the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last partial ten (481-488), 484 has a units digit of 4, so that's one more. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the units place: same logic. 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last partial ten, 488 has a units digit of 8, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nNow, tens place for 4: in each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: same approach. In each complete hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total 40 + 8 = 48. Correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this could be to calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages. Let me check that again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 7 (471-480), and then 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears only once, in the block 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. That's correct.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, it's in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for each of those 8 pages, so 8 instances. Correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nSo, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 91 seems like a large difference, but considering that 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times, which is a significant contribution, it might make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should write a small table to verify the counts.\n\nLet me create a table for each digit place:\n\nDigit 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 188\n\nDigit 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n- Total complete tens: 48 (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n- Remaining pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n- Complete hundreds: 4 (1-400), each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- Remaining pages (401-488):\n  - 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n  - 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- Total 4's: 4*10 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 4*10 + 8 = 48\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each digit position for both 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such blocks are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full blocks and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times in each block. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for numbers 401-410, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times.\n\nAdding them up: Units place 49 + Tens place 50 + Hundreds place 89 = 49 + 50 = 99, then 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each full block, units digit 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the partial block, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers in each block of 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full blocks and a partial block. In each full block, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding them up: Units place 49 + Tens place 49 + Hundreds place 0 = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. When counting the tens place for 8's, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-488. So, that's 480, 481, ..., 488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I counted 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place: In the partial block 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, 480 is part of the 400-499 range, but 480 is included in the 401-488 range? Wait, 480 is less than 488, so yes, it's included. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480 is the first number in the 480s, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's again. For the units place, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48, plus the partial block from 481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more, totaling 49.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 10 each, so 40, plus the partial block 401-488, which has 401-410, that's 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the partial block which includes 488, so one more, totaling 49.\n\nTens place: Each block of 100 contributes 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, so 4 blocks give 40, and the partial block 401-488 includes 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, totaling 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I made a mistake in the 8's tens place. Because in the partial block, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. But 480 is less than 481, which is the start of the partial block. Wait, no, 480 is included in 401-488 because 480 is greater than 401? Wait, no, 480 is less than 401. Wait, 480 is 480, which is less than 401? No, wait, 401 is 401, which is higher than 480. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 401 is 401, which is higher than 480? No, 480 is 480, which is higher than 400, but 401 is 401, which is higher than 400, but lower than 480. Wait, no, 401 is 401, which is less than 480. So, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. But 480 is less than 401? No, 480 is greater than 401, right? Wait, 401 is 401, 480 is 480, which is higher than 401. So, 480 is within the 401-488 range. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit 8 appears. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so yes, that's correct. So, the count for the tens place is 49.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nThus, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's are 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the hundreds place, since 800 is beyond 488, it's zero. So, correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's calculate the total number of digits used.\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating, but let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) = 48, plus if the last number is >= (4 mod 10), which it is, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488/10) = 48, and since 488 ends with 8, so 48 +1=49.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/100) = 4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Then, the remaining numbers are 488 - 400 = 88. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 400-409, so 10 more, total 50.\n\nSimilarly for 8: floor(488/100)=4, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40. Remaining numbers: 488 - 400 = 88. In the tens place, 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, total 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: 488 - 400 +1 = 89.\n\nNumber of times 8 appears: 0, as 800 is beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)= 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\n1. **Units place for 4's:**\n   - From page 1 to page 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - To find how many such blocks there are, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a block, I think we take the integer part, which is 48 full blocks. Each block contributes 1 four in the units place, so that's 48 fours.\n   - But wait, the last partial block from 481 to 488 also includes a 4 in the units place (484), so that's one more. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place for 4's:**\n   - Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, such as 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - How many full hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n   - Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 fours. Adding that, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 4's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. Each page number here has a hundreds digit of 4.\n   - From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNext, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place for 8's:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, every block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights.\n   - The last partial block from 481-488 includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place for 8's:**\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each block of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n   - The last partial hundred is 401-488. Here, the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 eights.\n   - Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens place 8's in the last partial block are 9.\n   - So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place for 8's:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 eights. So, 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier when I calculated 4's, I had 188, and 8's as 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for 4's, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct. So, 89.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the units place for 4's, I had 49. Let me check that again. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. The number of such numbers is floor(488/10) = 48, but since 484 is included, which is the 48th multiple plus 4, so 48 +1=49. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4's: every 100 numbers, 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 +10=50. So, total 4's in tens place is 50.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, total 8's:98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount that.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, in each full hundred, like 1-100, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 eights per hundred. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. That's 9 numbers because 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers (since 488-480+1=9). So, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nUnits place:49, tens place:49, so total 8's:98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting, especially in the hundreds place, I might have missed something. Let me think again.\n\nFor the hundreds place, 4's:400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89.\n\n8's in hundreds place: none, because the book ends at 488, so 800-899 isn't included.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4, 14, 24, ..., 484 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449 \u2192 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 \u2192 89 times.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8, 18, 28, ..., 488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488 \u2192 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** None, as pages go up to 488 \u2192 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nFor single-digit page numbers (1-9), the only 4 is page 4. So that's one occurrence of 4. Now, moving on to two-digit numbers, which range from 10 to 99. In two-digit numbers, the digits can be in the tens place or the ones place. So, I should consider both places separately.\n\nIn the tens place, the numbers from 40 to 49 will have a 4 in the tens digit. That's 10 pages (40, 41, ..., 49), so that's 10 occurrences of 4. In the ones place, the 4 appears in numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, ..., 94. Wait, but since we're only going up to 99, let me count how many times 4 appears in the ones place. From 10 to 99, every ten numbers have a 4 in the ones place. So that's 9 sets of ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), which would give 9 occurrences. But wait, in the 40-49 range, the ones place 4 is already counted in the tens place, but I think I'm considering them separately, so maybe it's 9 times 1, but actually, 40-49 is the tens place, so in the ones place, from 10-99, how many times does 4 appear? Let me think: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. But wait, 44 has two 4's, so in the ones place, it's 9 times, but 44 is included in both tens and ones place counts. So, in the ones place, it's 9 occurrences, and in the tens place, it's 10. So total for two-digit numbers, 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4. Wait, but 44 is counted twice, once in tens and once in ones. So that's correct because 44 has two 4's, so it contributes two to the total count. So, for two-digit numbers, 19 4's.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and ones places. Let's handle each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9. We need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place from 100 to 488. Let's break this down by hundreds. So, for hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, so in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149). Similarly, for hundreds digits 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). But wait, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, but for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, but 488 is the end, so does the tens digit go up to 8? Wait, no, because 488 is 4 8 8, so the tens digit in 400-488 can be from 0 to 8, right? Because 488 is the last page, so after 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in total, for the tens place, 10 (hundreds=1) + 10 (hundreds=2) + 10 (hundreds=3) + 10 (hundreds=4) = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's correct. So, 10 times in each hundred for the tens digit 4, so 4 hundreds (1,2,3,4) each contribute 10, so 40.\n\nNow, the ones place in three-digit numbers. The ones digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds digit, and for each tens digit, the ones digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers. Let's calculate this.\n\nFirst, hundreds digits can be 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The ones digit 4 appears in 104,114,124,...,194. That's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digits 2,3,4, each will have 10 occurrences of 4 in the ones place. So, 4 hundreds digits, each contributing 10, so 40 occurrences.\n\nWait, but wait, for hundreds digit 4, does the ones digit 4 go up to 488? Let me check. The last number is 488, so in hundreds digit 4, the ones digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times, right? Because 404 to 484, stepping by 10, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 404 is the first, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So, in hundreds digit 4, the ones digit 4 appears 9 times, not 10. So, I think I made a mistake earlier. So, for hundreds digits 1,2,3, each contributes 10, and hundreds digit 4 contributes 9. So, total ones digit 4's would be 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, let me confirm. For hundreds digit 1: 104,114,...,194: 10 numbers.\n\nSame for 2,3: 10 each.\n\nFor hundreds digit 4: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: that's 9 numbers because 494 would be beyond 488, so it stops at 484. So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total ones digit 4's in three-digit numbers: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 40, but now I see it's 39. So, I need to correct that.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (as calculated earlier)\n- Ones place: 39 times\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: 40 times, as each hundred contributes 10, and there are 4 hundreds, so 40.\n\nOnes place: 39 times, as hundreds digits 1,2,3 contribute 10 each, and 4 contributes 9, so 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nNow, two-digit numbers: 10 in tens place (40-49) and 9 in ones place (14,24,...,94), but wait, 44 is included in both, so total 10 + 9 = 19. Correct.\n\nSingle-digit: 1.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8 is the only single-digit 8, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: similar approach. Tens place and ones place.\n\nTens place: numbers from 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nOnes place: numbers like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so in the ones place, it's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both tens and ones place counts, so total 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. In the ones place, 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 numbers, but 88 is counted twice. So, total 10 + 9 = 19, but 88 is counted in both, so the total number of 8's in two-digit numbers is 19, but the actual count is 10 (tens) + 9 (ones) = 19, but since 88 is counted twice, the total number of 8's is 19, but the actual digits are 10 + 9 = 19. Wait, no, because each occurrence is a digit. So, in the tens place, 10 8's, and in the ones place, 9 8's, so total 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488.\n\nAgain, hundreds, tens, and ones places.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. So, the 8 appears in the hundreds place only if the hundreds digit is 8, but our book goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 0 occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: Now, in the tens place, 8 can appear in each hundred. So, for each hundreds digit (1,2,3,4), the tens digit 8 appears in 10 numbers each. So, for hundreds digit 1: 180-189, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for 2,3,4: each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total tens place 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40.\n\nBut wait, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 would go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, in hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 10. So, total tens place 8's: 10 (hundreds=1) +10 (hundreds=2)+10 (hundreds=3)+9 (hundreds=4)= 39.\n\nNow, ones place in three-digit numbers: The ones digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds digit, and for each tens digit, the ones digit 8 appears once.\n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, each has 10 possible tens digits (0-9). So, for each hundreds digit, the ones digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred. So, 4 hundreds digits * 10 = 40 occurrences.\n\nBut wait, for hundreds digit 4, the ones digit 8 can only go up to 488, so in the hundreds digit 4, the ones digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 498 would be beyond 488, so it stops at 488. So, 9 occurrences in the ones place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nSo, for hundreds digits 1,2,3: each contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the ones place, and hundreds digit 4 contributes 9.\n\nSo, total ones place 8's: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 39\n- Ones place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (page 8)\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19\n\nThree-digit: tens place 39, ones place 39, so 78\n\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's\n- Ones place: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94: 9 numbers, but 44 has two 4's, so in the ones place, it's 9 4's\n- So, total two-digit 4's: 10 + 9 = 19 (correct)\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's\n- Tens place: 40 times (10 each for hundreds 1,2,3,4)\n- Ones place: 39 times (10 each for 1,2,3 and 9 for 4)\n- So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 (correct)\n- Total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 (correct)\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 (correct)\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 80-89: 10 numbers\n- Ones place: 18,28,...,98: 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's, so in the ones place, it's 9 8's\n- Total two-digit 8's: 10 + 9 = 19 (correct)\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- Tens place: 10 each for hundreds 1,2,3 and 9 for 4, so 39\n- Ones place: 10 each for 1,2,3 and 9 for 4, so 39\n- Total three-digit 8's: 39 + 39 = 78 (correct)\n- Total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 (correct)\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Ones place: 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: Pages 400-488 \u2192 89 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (1, 2, 3) contributes 10, and 4 contributes 10 (440-449) \u2192 40.\n     - Ones place: Each hundred (1, 2, 3) contributes 10, and 4 contributes 9 (up to 484) \u2192 39.\n     - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 8 \u2192 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Tens place: Pages 80-89 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Ones place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Total: 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Hundreds place: No '8's since the highest is 488 \u2192 0.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred (1, 2, 3) contributes 10, and 4 contributes 9 (480-488) \u2192 39.\n     - Ones place: Each hundred (1, 2, 3) contributes 10, and 4 contributes 9 (up to 488) \u2192 39.\n     - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For each group of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. How many such groups are there? Well, from 1 to 488, that's 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full groups of ten and a remainder of 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times (once in each group of ten) plus one more in the last partial group if the units digit is 4. Wait, actually, the last group is from 481 to 488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in the units place in the last group as well (page 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, for 8's in the units place: each group of ten has one 8, so 48 times, and in the last group, page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly ten times in each hundred. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), up to 9 (90-99). So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly for 8 (80-89). Now, since the book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, we have four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400s, which is the fifth hundred. But let me check: from 1 to 400, that's four full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights. Now, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, how many fours and eights are there? \n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but wait, 441-450 is only 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages. Similarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 fours and 8 eights. Therefore, the total for the tens place is 40 (from 1-400) + 10 = 50 fours, and 40 + 8 = 48 eights. So, the difference in the tens place is 50 - 48 = 2 more fours than eights.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the number of fours in the hundreds place is 89, and the number of eights is 0. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more fours than eights.\n\nNow, let me add up the differences from each place. Units place: 0 difference. Tens place: +2. Hundreds place: +89. So, total difference is 0 + 2 + 89 = 91. Wait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 fours and 49 eights, so that's correct, difference zero. Tens place: from 1-400, 40 fours and 40 eights. Then from 401-488, 10 fours and 8 eights. So, total fours in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, eights: 40 + 8 = 48. So, difference is 2. That's correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. So, difference is 89. So, total difference is 2 + 89 = 91. Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, when I count the hundreds place, is it correct to say that 4 appears 89 times? Because from 400 to 488, each page number has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 pages, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, yes, 89 fours. And no eights in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I'm double-counting or missing something. Let me think about the total number of digits. From 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each, so 9 digits. 10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each, so 180 digits. 100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each, so 1167 digits. Total digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits. But maybe that's not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the total number of fours and eights separately and then subtract. Let me try that approach to verify.\n\nTotal number of fours:\n\n- Units place: as calculated, 49.\n\n- Tens place: 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of eights:\n\n- Units place: 49.\n\n- Tens place: 48.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 97 = 91. That matches my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 91 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. The tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 eights. That's correct.\n\nYes, I think that's right. So, the answer is 91 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of ten numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 full groups of ten (1-480) and a partial group (481-488).\n   - In each full group, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place: 48 times each.\n   - In the partial group (481-488), '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred (e.g., 1-100) has ten '4's and ten '8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are four hundreds, contributing 40 '4's and 40 '8's.\n   - From 401-488, '4' appears in 441-450 (10 times) and '8' appears in 481-488 (8 times).\n   - Total tens place: 50 '4's and 48 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n**Calculating the Total:**\n- Total '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Total '8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n- Difference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with the single-digit page numbers: these are from 1 to 9. The only single-digit page number that has a 4 is page 4 itself. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, moving on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in either the tens place or the units place. Let me consider each case separately.\n\nFirst, the tens place: If the tens digit is 4, then the page numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, the units place: The digit 4 can appear in the units place for numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but since we're only considering two-digit numbers (10-99), the numbers go up to 99, so 94 is included. Let me count these: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 44 is already counted in the tens place, but in the units place as well. So, does that mean I'm double-counting 44? Let me think. No, actually, each occurrence of the digit is counted separately. So, in 44, the tens digit is 4 and the units digit is 4, so that's two separate counts. So, in the tens place, I have 10 numbers, each contributing one 4, and in the units place, I have 9 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but hold on, when I count the units place, does it include 44? Let me check: 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. Yes, 44 is included, so the units digit count is 9, including 44. So, the total for two-digit numbers is indeed 19.\n\nNow, moving on to the three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the hundreds place, the tens place, or the units place. Let me handle each position separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, but when it's 4, the tens and units digits are limited. Let me break it down.\n\nFor the hundreds place: When the hundreds digit is 4, the page numbers run from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place for three-digit numbers: Here, the tens digit can be 4, regardless of the hundreds digit. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), I need to count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nLet me consider each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit is 4 for numbers 140-149. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, another 10 occurrences.\n3. 300-399: 340-349, another 10 occurrences.\n4. 400-488: Now, here, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, in total, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences of 4.\n\nWait, but hold on, 400-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers: The units digit can be 4 regardless of the hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds group, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nAgain, let's go through each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: The units digit is 4 for 104, 114, 124, 134, 144, 154, 164, 174, 184, 194. That's 10 numbers.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, 224, 234, 244, 254, 264, 274, 284, 294. Another 10.\n3. 300-399: 304, 314, 324, 334, 344, 354, 364, 374, 384, 394. Another 10.\n4. 400-488: Now, here, the units digit is 4 for 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 484 is within 488, so that's 9 numbers. Wait, let me check: starting from 404, each 10th number up to 484. So, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the 9th occurrence (since 404 is the first). Wait, no, actually, from 404 to 484, how many steps of 10? Let me calculate: (484 - 404)/10 + 1 = (80)/10 +1 = 8 +1=9. So, 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but is 484 included? Yes, because 484 is less than 488. So, the units place in the 400-488 range gives 9 occurrences of 4.\n\nSo, adding up the units place across all hundreds groups: 10 +10 +10 +9 = 39 occurrences of 4 in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let me total up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: hundreds (89) + tens (40) + units (39) = 89 + 40 = 129; 129 +39=168\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 +19 +168 = 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: hundreds=89, tens=40, units=39. So, 89+40=129, 129+39=168.\n\nTotal 4's: 1+19=20; 20+168=188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting again with single-digit page numbers: 1-9. The only single-digit page number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: When the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 for numbers like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences of 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both the tens and units counts. So, similar to the 4's, each occurrence is counted separately. So, total for two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19 occurrences of 8.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, when the hundreds digit is 8, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, zero occurrences in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: The tens digit can be 8 in the three-digit numbers. Let's check each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: Tens digit 8 is 180-189. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n2. 200-299: 280-289, another 10.\n3. 300-399: 380-389, another 10.\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, that's 9 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480 to 488 inclusive is 9 numbers because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, in the tens place for 400-488, we have 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for tens place across all three-digit numbers: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nUnits place: The units digit is 8 in three-digit numbers. Let's go through each hundreds group:\n\n1. 100-199: Units digit 8 for 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n2. 200-299: 208,218,228,238,248,258,268,278,288,298. Another 10.\n3. 300-399: 308,318,328,338,348,358,368,378,388,398. Another 10.\n4. 400-488: Units digit 8 for 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's see: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is included, so from 408 to 488 with step 10, that's (488-408)/10 +1=80/10 +1=9.\n\nSo, units place across all hundreds groups: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nWait, but let me check the 400-488 units place again. 408,418,...,488. How many is that? From 408 to 488, stepping by 10. Let's list them: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Yes, that's 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total for units place: 39.\n\nNow, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 =78.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake. The hundreds place is 0, tens place is 39, and units place is 39. So, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39 +39=78.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) =39\n- Units place: 10+10+10+9=39\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: 39+39=78.\n\nNow, let's total up all the 8's:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) =98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the three-digit counts:\n\nTens place:39, units place:39, so 78.\n\nYes, so total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed anything. For example, in the two-digit numbers, I had 10 in tens place and 9 in units place, totaling 19. That seems correct.\n\nIn three-digit numbers, for 8's:\n\n- Tens place:10+10+10+9=39\n- Units place:10+10+10+9=39\nTotal:78\n\nAdding single-digit 1 and two-digit 19:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place in three-digit numbers. For each hundreds group, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488, I counted 10,10,10,9 respectively for units digit 8. That seems correct because 400-488 only goes up to 488, so the last number with units digit 8 is 488, which is the 9th occurrence in that group.\n\nSo, 10+10+10+9=39 for units place, and same for tens place, so 78 total in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, total 8's:98.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify. Let's think about the total number of digits printed. From 1 to 488, how many digits are there? Well, that's a different problem, but maybe I can use it to check if my counts for 4's and 8's make sense.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed. So, total 4's:188; total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again because 90 seems high.\n\nWait, let me go back and check each step carefully.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 4)\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place:40-49:10 numbers, so 10 4's\n- Units place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9 numbers, so 9 4's\nTotal two-digit 4's:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place:400-488:89 numbers, so 89 4's\n- Tens place:\n  - 100-199:140-149:10\n  - 200-299:240-249:10\n  - 300-399:340-349:10\n  - 400-488:440-449:10\n  Total tens place:10+10+10+10=40\n- Units place:\n  - 100-199:104,114,...,194:10\n  - 200-299:204,214,...,294:10\n  - 300-399:304,314,...,394:10\n  - 400-488:404,414,...,484:9\n  Total units place:10+10+10+9=39\nTotal three-digit 4's:89+40+39=168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1 (page 8)\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place:80-89:10\n- Units place:18,28,...,98:9\nTotal two-digit 8's:10+9=19\n\nThree-digit:\n- Hundreds place:0 (since 800 is beyond 488)\n- Tens place:\n  - 100-199:180-189:10\n  - 200-299:280-289:10\n  - 300-399:380-389:10\n  - 400-488:480-488:9\n  Total tens place:10+10+10+9=39\n- Units place:\n  - 100-199:108,118,...,198:10\n  - 200-299:208,218,...,298:10\n  - 300-399:308,318,...,398:10\n  - 400-488:408,418,...,488:9\n  Total units place:10+10+10+9=39\nTotal three-digit 8's:39+39=78\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like 90 is a lot, but perhaps that's correct. Let me think if I double-counted anywhere.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for the hundreds place, I only counted 400-488, which is correct. For the tens and units places, I counted each hundreds group correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check with a smaller example to see if my method is correct. Let's say a book with pages 1-20.\n\nHow many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nSingle-digit:\n4:1\n8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\nTens place for 4:40-49, but in 1-20, it's only 40-49 which is beyond 20, so zero.\nWait, no, 10-20. So, tens place for 4 doesn't exist in 10-20.\n\nWait, in 10-20, the tens digit is 1 or 2, so no 4's in tens place.\n\nUnits place for 4:14, which is within 1-20. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nSimilarly, units place for 8:18, which is within 20. So, 1 occurrence.\n\nSo, total 4's:1 (single) +1 (two-digit)=2\nTotal 8's:1 (single) +1 (two-digit)=2\nDifference:0\n\nWait, but according to my method, let's see:\n\nFor 1-20:\n\nSingle-digit 4's:1\nTwo-digit 4's:14 (units place), so 1\nThree-digit: none\nTotal 4's:2\n\nSingle-digit 8's:1\nTwo-digit 8's:18 (units place), so 1\nThree-digit: none\nTotal 8's:2\n\nDifference:0, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 1-100.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place:40-49:10\n- Units place:14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94:9\nTotal two-digit 4's:19\nThree-digit: none\nTotal 4's:1+19=20\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:\n- Tens place:80-89:10\n- Units place:18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98:9\nTotal two-digit 8's:19\nThree-digit: none\nTotal 8's:1+19=20\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 1-100, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, which they are. So, my method works here.\n\nWait, but in the original problem, the book is 488 pages, so up to 488. So, perhaps the difference is indeed 90. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, 188 4's and 98 8's, difference is 90.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit counts for 8's. Let me check the three-digit 8's again.\n\nThree-digit 8's:\n\nTens place:\n\n100-199:180-189:10\n200-299:280-289:10\n300-399:380-389:10\n400-488:480-488:9\n\nTotal tens place:39\n\nUnits place:\n\n100-199:108,118,...,198:10\n200-299:208,...,298:10\n300-399:308,...,398:10\n400-488:408,418,...,488:9\n\nTotal units place:39\n\nSo, 39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit)=98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 is a three-digit number, and in the units place for 400-488, I counted 9 occurrences of 8. But 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For each digit position, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nBut perhaps I can think of the total number of 4's and 8's in each position.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model it as follows:\n\nFor each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nWell, in every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10=48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), 484 is included, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 188 4's, which includes all positions. Hmm, but perhaps this approach is different.\n\nWait, maybe I should use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor a given digit d and position p (units=1, tens=10, hundreds=100), the count can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet me refer to a standard digit counting method.\n\nThe formula is a bit involved, but let me try to recall.\n\nFor each digit position, you can calculate the number of times a digit appears by looking at higher digits, current digit, and lower digits.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, for units place:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place from 1 to N is:\n\nLet me denote N=488.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nunits_4 = (N + 1) // 10 * 1 + min(max(N % 10 - 4 + 1, 0), 1)\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place = (N // 10) * 1 + (1 if (N % 10 >=4) else 0)\n\nWait, but let me test this with N=488.\n\nN//10=48, so 48 times 10, so 48 occurrences.\n\nThen, since 488%10=8 >=4, add 1, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place:\n\nunits_8 = (N // 10) *1 + (1 if (N%10 >=8) else 0)\n\nSo, N//10=48, so 48, and 488%10=8 >=8, so add 1. So, 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 49 4's in units place? Wait no, earlier I had 39 in three-digit numbers, but perhaps that was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the methods.\n\nWait, perhaps using this formula would be more accurate.\n\nLet me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place from 1 to 488:\n\nAs per the formula:\n\nunits_4 = (488 // 10) *1 + (1 if (488 %10 >=4) else 0)\n=48*1 +1=49\n\nSimilarly, number of 8's in units place:\n\nunits_8 = (488//10)*1 + (1 if (488%10 >=8) else 0)\n=48*1 +1=49\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 for 4's in units place in three-digit numbers, but according to this, it's 49. There's a discrepancy here, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me see.\n\nIn the three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- 100-199:10\n- 200-299:10\n- 300-399:10\n- 400-488:9\n\nTotal:39.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 49. So, I must have missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the formula counts all units digits from 1-488, including single and two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, yes, so the formula gives 49 for units place 4's, which includes single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSimilarly, earlier, when I broke it down into single, two, and three-digit numbers, I had:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:9\nThree-digit:39\nTotal:1+9+39=49.\n\nAh, that's correct. So, earlier, I had 39 in three-digit, but I forgot that single and two-digit also contribute to the units place. So, total units place 4's:49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:49.\n\nWait, but earlier, I had 39 for 8's in units place in three-digit numbers, but according to the formula, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier breakdown.\n\nWait, perhaps I should redo the counts using this formula for each digit position.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nCalculating number of times a digit d appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) from 1 to N=488.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\nUnits place:\n\nunits_4 = (488 //10)*1 + (1 if (488%10 >=4) else 0)\n=48*1 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\ntens_4 = (488 //100)*10 + (if (488%100 >=40) then (488%100 -40 +1) else 0)\nWait, let me use the standard formula.\n\nThe formula for tens place is:\n\nhigher = N // 100\ncurrent = (N //10) %10\nlower = N %10\n\nif current >4: count += (higher +1)*10\nelif current ==4: count += (higher)*10 + lower +1\nelse: count += (higher)*10\n\nSo, for 4 in tens place:\n\nhigher =488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8>4, count += (4+1)*10=5*10=50\n\nSo, tens_4=50\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFor hundreds place, digit 4:\n\nhigher = N //1000=0\ncurrent=(N//100)%10=4\nlower=N%100=88\n\nSince current=4, count += (higher)*100 + (lower +1)\n=0*100 +88+1=89\n\nSo, hundreds_4=89\n\nTotal 4's: units_4 + tens_4 + hundreds_4=49+50+89=188\n\nWhich matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8:\n\nUnits place:\n\nunits_8 = (488//10)*1 + (1 if (488%10 >=8) else 0)\n=48*1 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n\nhigher=488//100=4\ncurrent=(488//10)%10=8\nlower=488%10=8\n\nSince current=8>8? No, current=8, which is equal to 8.\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nif current >d: count += (higher +1)*10\nelif current ==d: count += (higher)*10 + lower +1\nelse: count += (higher)*10\n\nSo, for d=8, current=8.\n\nThus, count += higher*10 + lower +1\n=4*10 +88 +1=40 +88=128 +1=129\n\nWait, but that can't be right because from 1-488, the tens digit 8 appears only in 80-89, 180-189, etc., up to 480-488.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, let me think again. The formula for the tens place when current digit is equal to d:\n\ncount += (higher)*10 + (lower +1)\n\nBut in this case, higher=4, current=8, lower=88.\n\nSo, count +=4*10 +88 +1=40+88+1=129.\n\nBut that seems too high because in reality, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred group, except the last one which is cut off at 488.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nTotal:10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nBut according to the formula, it's 129, which is way off. So, I must have misapplied the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is for the number of times the digit appears in the tens place up to N=488.\n\nWait, the correct count is 49, as per manual counting. So, perhaps the formula is not applicable here or I'm using it incorrectly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach.\n\nWait, let me think differently. For the tens place, how many times does 8 appear?\n\nIn each hundred group, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred group, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNow, how many complete hundred groups are there in 488? There are 4 complete hundred groups: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and the last partial group 400-488.\n\nWait, actually, 488 is in the 400-488 group, which is the fifth hundred group.\n\nWait, no, 0-99 is the first, 100-199 second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth, and 400-488 fifth.\n\nSo, in each complete hundred group (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSo, for four complete groups (0-39"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of ten and then a partial group of 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for the complete groups. But in the last partial group, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens position for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens every hundred. So, in the range 1-100, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49). Then, in 101-200, it's another 10 times (140-149), and so on.\n\nLet me calculate how many such blocks there are in 488 pages. From 1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, and 400-488. So, that's five blocks. Wait, actually, from 1-100 is the first, then 100-200 is the second, 200-300 third, 300-400 fourth, and 400-488 fifth. So, five blocks in total.\n\nIn each of the first four blocks (1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, the last block is 400-488. Here, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is less than 500, so does the 400-488 block include the entire 40-49 in the tens place? Let me check: 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8 in the hundreds place, but in the tens place, it cycles through 0-9 each hundred. Wait, no, in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, does the 4 in the tens place occur only from 440-449? Yes, because 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's another 10 times. So, in total, the tens place 4's are 40 (from the first four blocks) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50 times.\n\nWait, hold on, that might not be correct. Because 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 still appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 times. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many complete groups of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which has units digits from 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place.\n\nHow many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Let's see, from 1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400, and 400-488. So, five blocks.\n\nIn each of the first four blocks (1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400), the tens digit 8 appears 10 times each. So, 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, the last block is 400-488. Here, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), right? Because 488 is the last page. So, does that mean the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times here? Let me check: 480, 481, ..., 488. The tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last block. So, total tens place 8's are 40 (from the first four blocks) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but in the first four blocks, each block had exactly 10 numbers where the tens digit was 8, right? So, 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-200: 180-189 (10), 200-300: 280-289 (10), 300-400: 380-389 (10). So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 instead of 10. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the hundreds place 8's are zero.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check. Units place 8's: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, plus one more in 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 blocks of 10 each (80-89, 180-189, etc.) totaling 40, plus in the last block (400-488), 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more, making 49. So, yes, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of those numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, I think I had 50 for 4's. Let me see: in the first four hundreds, each had a 40-49 block, which is 10 each, so 4\u00d710=40, and then in 400-488, the 440-449 block is another 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, the tens place had 49, units place 49, so 98 total. So, 188 - 98 is indeed 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In every group of ten (e.g., 1-10, 11-20), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete groups (488 / 10 = 48.8) and a partial group (481-488). The digit 4 appears 48 times in complete groups and once in the partial group, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49) in each hundred. There are four complete hundreds (1-100, 100-200, 200-300, 300-400) contributing 10 each, totaling 40. In 400-488, 440-449 adds another 10, making it 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once per group of ten, totaling 48 in complete groups and once in the partial group (488), making 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers in each hundred, totaling 40 in the first four hundreds. In 400-488, 480-488 contributes 9, making it 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. So, I'll start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I think this is the right approach because each digit place can be analyzed independently, which should make it easier to count occurrences.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. But wait, actually, from 1 to 10, it's 1 to 10, so 10 is two digits, but the units digit is 0. So, in each block of 10, the units digits go from 0 to 9, but the first block is 1-10, so the units digits are 1-0. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as starting from 0-9 for each digit place, but since page numbers start at 1, I might need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, maybe a better way is to consider that for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times each digit appears can be calculated based on the number of complete cycles and any remaining numbers. Let me try to formalize this.\n\nFor the units place: In every set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, the total number of times a particular digit appears in the units place is equal to the number of complete tens in the total number of pages, plus any extra in the incomplete set if the total isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place: In every set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 10 numbers, and each digit appears 10 times. So, for the tens place, the number of times a digit appears is determined by how many complete hundreds there are and any extra tens in the incomplete hundred.\n\nFor the hundreds place: In every set of 1000 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 100 times in the hundreds place. But since our book only has 488 pages, we're dealing with hundreds place only up to 4 (since 400-488 are the three-digit numbers starting with 4). So, the hundreds digit cycles as 1,2,3,4 for the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit starts at 1 for page 100, right? So, the hundreds place is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, let me structure this.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the number of 4's in each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for 8's, then subtract the totals.\n\nStarting with the number of 4's:\n\nUnits place:\nTotal number of pages is 488. The number of complete tens in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. But wait, 48*10=480, so pages 1-480 have 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 more pages, the units digits go from 1-8, so no additional 4's in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nTens place:\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, in 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 pages, not a full hundred. So, for the tens place, each digit appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in the tens place for each digit. But wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times. So, for 4 full hundreds (100-400), that's 4*10=40 times each digit in the tens place. Then, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), 2 (420-429), 3 (430-439), 4 (440-449), 5 (450-459), 6 (460-469), 7 (470-479), 8 (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is only 9 pages (480-488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488.\n\nBut wait, I'm trying to count the number of 4's in the tens place. So, in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times each digit. So, for 4 full hundreds (100-400), each digit appears 4*10=40 times. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digits go up to 8, so the digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages (440-449). So, that's an additional 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages. So, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, the number of times it appears is 10, except for the last one, which may be less. But in this case, 480-488 is only 9 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. But for the digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, yes, total 50 times.\n\nHundreds place:\nNow, the hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. Each digit in the hundreds place appears for 100 pages, except possibly the last one. So, from 100-199, hundreds digit is 1 (100 times). From 200-299, it's 2 (100 times). From 300-399, it's 3 (100 times). From 400-488, it's 4 (89 times). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nUnits place:\nSame as before, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place in 480 pages, and then from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\nFor the tens place, each digit appears 4*10=40 times in the first 400 pages. Then, from 400-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, the digit 8 in the tens place appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\nThe hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. Therefore, 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 +49 +0=98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits: 48\nTens:50\nHundreds:89\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits:49\nTens:49\nHundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let's go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 pages contribute one 4. 488 pages mean 48 full tens (48*10=480 pages), so 48 4's. From 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so no additional 4's. So, 48.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. 4 hundreds (100-400) contribute 4*10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. Total 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's:48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: Each 10 pages contribute one 8. 48 full tens (480 pages) give 48 8's. From 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so one more 8. Total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place. 4 hundreds (100-400) give 4*10=40. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is calculated by analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds). Similarly, the number of times the digit 8 appears is calculated. Subtracting the total occurrences of 8 from those of 4 gives the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 48 times (once every 10 pages, 480 pages contribute 48 4's; 481-488 have no additional 4's).\n   - **Tens Place:** 50 times (40 from 100-400, and 10 from 440-449).\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** 49 times (48 from 1-480, plus one in 481-488).\n   - **Tens Place:** 49 times (40 from 100-400, plus 9 from 480-488).\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 0 times.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet's start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each of these 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on. \n\nLet's see how many hundreds are there in 488. There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (up to 400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred). So, for four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but wait a second. 401-488 includes 401 to 488. The tens digit in 401-488 goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, when the tens digit is 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, yes, that's correct, adding 10 more, making it 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Wait, but the hundreds digit is only 4 in 400-488, but the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400 is the first number with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Let me check: 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 for 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, let me think carefully.\n\nEach hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8. For example, 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers). Similarly, 101-200: 180-189 (10), 201-300: 280-289 (10), 301-400: 380-389 (10). Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). So, in the tens place, how many 8's?\n\nIn the first three hundreds (1-300), each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 3 * 10 = 30. Then, in 301-400, it's another 10 (380-389). So that's 4 * 10 = 40 up to 400. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 more 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's total is 188, and 8's total is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 pages (481-488), which include 484, so 1 more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 pages (481-488), which include 488, so 1 more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: In each of the first four hundreds (1-400), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as there are no pages 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 4's, I considered 401-488 as contributing 10 4's in the tens place (440-449). That's correct because 440-449 is within 401-488. So, yes, 10 more.\n\nIn the tens place for 8's, in 401-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's, which is correct.\n\nYes, I think I did everything correctly. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48, plus one more in 481-488 (484), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10, with 4 hundreds (1-400) giving 40, plus 10 in 401-488 (440-449), totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89, totaling 89.\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades contribute 48, plus one more in 481-488 (488), totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes 10, with 4 hundreds (1-400) giving 40, plus 9 in 401-488 (480-488), totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0, as there are no pages 800-899.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should calculate the number of times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by calculating how many 4's are there in each position.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full sets of ten, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each full set of ten, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, right? So, how many such sets are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five sets, each contributing 10 numbers. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 48 full sets of ten and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times in the units place. Now, checking the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once here (page 488). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers each time. The ranges would be 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last range is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many full sets do we have?\n\nFrom 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\n180-189: another 10.\n\n280-289: another 10.\n\n380-389: another 10.\n\n480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Each of the first four ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 8's each, so that's 4 x 10 = 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the units place for 8's was 49, but let me double-check. From 1-488, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 8's, and then from 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as I calculated, it's 49. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place for 8's was 49 and tens place was 49, so total 98. But let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, when calculating the units place for 8's, from 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. How many such numbers are there? The last one is 488, which is the 49th occurrence because 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 plus 8. So, 49 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, as I calculated, it's 49 times as well. So, total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the 4's were 187 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. But let me check again because that seems a bit high.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I calculated the 4's, I got 187, and 8's as 98, so 187 - 98 = 89. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the 4's count.\n\nFor 4's in the units place: 48 times, correct.\n\nIn the tens place: 5 sets of 10, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5 x 10 = 50, correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's, correct.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nTens place: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake because 89 seems a bit high, but perhaps it's correct.\n\nWait, let me think again about the 8's in the tens place. The ranges are 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49, correct.\n\nSo, 49 in the tens place and 49 in the units place, totaling 98. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 89 4's there.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: from 1-488, how many 4's in each position.\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then in the last partial cycle (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so no 4. So, 48.\n\nTens place: floor(488/100) = 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, but wait, no, that's not the right approach. Wait, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, and in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, from 1-488, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, correct.\n\nHundreds place: only in 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, and then in the last partial cycle (481-488), units digit 8 appears once at 488, so 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: Let's see, each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, 10 8's in tens place.\n- 180-189: another 10.\n- 280-289: another 10.\n- 380-389: another 10.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: no 8's, since the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 187 4's - 98 8's = 89 more 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake because 89 seemed high, but upon rechecking, it seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Calculate the number of '4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Only the full decades contribute '4's in the units place: 48 times.\n   - **Tens place:** The tens digit is '4' in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of '8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '8'. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades and 8 extra numbers (481-488). The extra numbers include one '8' at 488: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** The tens digit is '8' in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 '8's, and the range 480-488 contributes 9 '8's: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total '8's from the total '4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' appears 89 more times than the digit '8' in the page numbers.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count the number of times a specific digit appears, I can analyze each digit place separately: the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place. So, maybe I should calculate how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference between the two totals.\n\nLet me start with the digit 4. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\n**Units Place for 4:**\nIn the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (page 4). From 11 to 20, it's page 14, and so on. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the 48th cycle ends at 480, and then there's 481-488. In the 489th cycle, which is 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, each 10 pages contribute one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, the units digit 4 is at 484, so that's one more, making it 49. Yeah, that seems right.\n\n**Tens Place for 4:**\nNow, the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for every block of 100 pages, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So, from 1-100, 40-49 is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, 140-149 is another 10, and from 201-300, 240-249 is another 10. From 301-400, 340-349 is another 10. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10. Let me count: 10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-488) = 50 times. So, 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, but does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 440 is within 401-488. So, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\n**Hundreds Place for 4:**\nThe hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 in each of those. So, 89 times.\n\nNow, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n**Units Place for 8:**\nSimilarly, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 pages. From 1-10, page 8; 11-20, page 18, etc. So, up to 480, that's 48 times, as 480 divided by 10 is 48. Then, from 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place for 8:**\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So, each of these blocks contributes 10 times except the last one, which is only 9 pages (480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no: 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, how many blocks?\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89: 10 times\nFrom 101-200: 180-189: 10 times\nFrom 201-300: 280-289: 10 times\nFrom 301-400: 380-389: 10 times\nFrom 401-488: 480-488: 9 times\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check: 10 in each of the first four blocks, and 9 in the last, so 4*10 +9=49. Yes.\n\n**Hundreds Place for 8:**\nNow, the hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's:188, total 8's:98. So, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: from 1-480, every 10 pages, so 48 times. Then 484 is in 481-488, so +1, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40-49 in each hundred. 1-100:10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, 401-488:440-449, which is 10. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times. So, 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: same as 4's, 49 times. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four contributes 10, and the last contributes 9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the tens place for 8. When I count 80-89, that's 10 pages. Similarly, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488-480=8, plus 1 is 9. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nHmm, okay, so the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188-98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in 4, in each hundred, 40-49:10 pages, so 4 times 10 for the first four hundreds, and then in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is another 10, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's correct.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the parts, and the calculations seem accurate. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 pages. From 1 to 480, that's 48 times. Additionally, 484 adds one more, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Each block contributes 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 pages, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, ..., 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last contributes 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 doesn't appear since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits 4 and 8 each appear exactly once. So, for single-digit pages, both 4 and 8 have a count of 1.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each place separately when counting the digits.\n\nStarting with the tens place in two-digit numbers: the tens digits range from 1 to 9. So, for the digit 4 in the tens place, the numbers would be 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers would be 80-89, which is another 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nNow, looking at the units place in two-digit numbers: each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in each set of ten numbers. For example, in 10-19, the units digits go from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once (at 14) and 8 appears once (at 18). This pattern repeats for each subsequent set of ten. Since there are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit from 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. However, I think I need to adjust this because the range is from 10-99, which is 90 numbers, so 9 sets of ten. Therefore, each digit 0-9 appears 9 times in the units place. Wait, but 0 appears 9 times in the units place as well? Hmm, actually, no, because in each set of ten, 0 appears once in the units place, so yes, 9 times in total for 0. But for digits 1-9, each appears 9 times in the units place as well. So, for the units place in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times each.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 10-99, there are 90 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place because for each ten's group (like 10-19), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place, and there are 9 such groups. So yes, 9 times each for digits 0-9 in the units place. So, in two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place, totaling 19 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place and 9 times in the units place, totaling 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because when I add the single-digit and two-digit counts, I might end up with the same number, but let me proceed and check later.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I'll need to consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many three-digit numbers there are. From 100 to 488, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers. But perhaps it's easier to break it down by hundreds.\n\nLet me consider the hundreds place first. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit ranges from 1 to 4. Now, for the digit 4 in the hundreds place, the numbers are from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, since the maximum page number is 488, the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, the digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place for any three-digit page number. So, the count for 8 in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred separately. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor each hundred group, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. However, for the last hundred group, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, because 488 is the last page. So, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, meaning that the digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but let me check: from 400-488, the tens digit can be 0 (400-409), 1 (410-419), ..., up to 8 (480-488). So, for each hundred group except the last one, the tens digit goes from 0-9, so 10 numbers for each digit. But in the last hundred group (400-488), the tens digit goes up to 8, so digits 0-8 appear in the tens place, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times, while digits 0-7 appear 10 times each.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's better to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nLet me try this approach. For each hundred group:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each digit 0-9, it appears 10 times in the tens place. So, digit 4 appears 10 times, digit 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above, 10 times each for digits 0-9 in the tens place.\n\n3. 300-399: Same, 10 times each for digits 0-9.\n\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for each digit 0-8, it appears 10 times in the tens place, except for digit 8, which appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the tens place for 400-488, digit 8 appears 9 times, and digits 0-7 appear 10 times each.\n\nSo, total for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 4 in the tens place: 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488, since 4 is less than 8) = 40 times.\n\nWait, no, wait. From 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so digit 4 would appear in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, yes, 10 times for 4 in the tens place in 400-488. So, total for 4 in the tens place is 10+10+10+10=40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in the tens place: in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each have 10 times, so 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, 8 appears 9 times. So, total for 8 in the tens place is 30+9=39 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's consider each hundred group.\n\nIn each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred group, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. However, in the last hundred group, 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last ten (480-488). Wait, no, actually, in 400-488, the units digit for each ten goes from 0-9 except in the last ten, where it only goes up to 8. So, let's break it down.\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each hundred group has 100 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place.\n\nFor 400-488: This is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). Let's see how the units digits are distributed. Each ten (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has 10 numbers, except the last ten, which is 480-488, which has 9 numbers. So, in each of the first 8 tens (400-409 up to 470-479), the units digits go from 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times. But in the last ten, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once, and 9 doesn't appear. Therefore, in 400-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (from 404, 414, ..., 484), and digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place (from 408, 418, ..., 488). Wait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, no. For each ten, the units digit cycles through 0-9, except the last ten, which only goes up to 8. So, in 400-488, how many times does digit 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: in each ten, 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, each has a units digit 4 once, so that's 8 tens, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 8 times. Then, in 480-488, units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total in 400-488, digit 4 appears 8+1=9 times in the units place. Similarly, digit 8 in the units place: in each of the first 8 tens, digit 8 appears once, so 8 times, and in 480-488, digit 8 appears at 488, so 1 more time, totaling 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 includes 488, which is the only number with units digit 8 in that last ten. So, yes, 9 times in total for digit 8 in the units place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's list them:\n\n- 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 in the units place:\n\n- 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times.\n\nSo, in 400-488, digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and digit 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nTherefore, across all three-digit numbers, the units place counts are:\n\n- For digit 4: 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\n- For digit 8: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in 400-488, digit 8 appears 9 times, and in the other hundreds, 10 times each, so 3*10 +9=39. Similarly for 4.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\n- 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTens place: 40 times for 4 and 39 times for 8. Let me confirm:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\n- 200-299: same, 10 each.\n\n- 300-399: same, 10 each.\n\n- 400-488: 10 times for 4 in the tens place (440-449), and 9 times for 8 (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place. So, total for 8 in the tens place: 3*10 +9=39, correct. For 4, 4 appears 10 times in each of the four hundreds? Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 10 (from 100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) =40 times for 4 in the tens place. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For 4, 10+10+10+9=39. For 8, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units) =168.\n\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n- 4:1\n\n- 8:1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n- 4:19\n\n- 8:19\n\nThree-digit:\n\n- 4:168\n\n- 8:78\n\nSo, total for 4:\n\n1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) =1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\nTotal for 8:\n\n1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit) =1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.\n\nThe problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so subtract 98 from 188: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with single-digit: both 4 and 8 appear once. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\n- Units place: each digit appears 9 times (since two-digit numbers are from 10-99, which is 90 numbers, so 9 sets of 10, each digit appears 9 times in the units place). So, 9 each for 4 and 8.\n\nTotal for two-digit numbers: 10+9=19 for 4, same for 8. Correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\n- Units place: 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSo, 4:89+40+39=168.\n\n8:0+39+39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n\n4:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\n8:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, and so on, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each ten numbers, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many such sets of ten are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, for the units place, in each of the 48 full sets, we have one 4 and one 8. So that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. \n\nNow, for the extra 8 pages: 481-488. Let's look at the units digits here. The units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, so in the units place, they're equal. \n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. \n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. From 1-488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (e.g., 40-49 in the first hundred). So, 4 full hundreds would have 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nNow, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in this range, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 488 is the end, so 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, let's see. In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, which is 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds would have 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. \n\nIn the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, that's from 480 to 488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. That means 4's have 1 more occurrence in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero for numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-488, the hundreds digit cycles from 1 to 4. \n\nLet's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, looking at the page numbers up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. There is no page number with hundreds digit 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, the digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4's appear 89 times, 8's appear 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 188 - 98 = 90, but I feel like that might be too high. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let's go through each place again carefully.\n\nUnits place:\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, units 8's: same logic. 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\nFor 4's in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place. Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8 (e.g., 80-89). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, that's from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences. So, total tens 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n4's: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences.\n\n8's: None, as the hundreds digit never reaches 8 in 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me verify again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it another way. Let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately, ensuring I didn't miss anything.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nFor units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial set. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488 / 10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in these, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for each hundred, 10 times each digit in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the end). So, for the digit 4 in tens place: in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's. For 8's: in 401-488, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nDigits go from 0-4 (since the book ends at 488). So, hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 times. Hundreds digit 8 never appears because 800 is beyond 488. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems a large number. Let me check with another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nNumber of 4's: For each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total full tens: 488 // 10 = 48. So, 48 * 1 = 48. Then, check the remaining 8 numbers (481-488). The units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. So, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4 * 10 = 40. In 401-488, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\n8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering the single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 also appears once (page 8). So, in single-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. That means the difference so far is zero.\n\nNext, I'll look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Two-digit numbers have a tens place and a units place. I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place for two-digit numbers: the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. For the digit 4 in the tens place, the numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place, the numbers would be 80 to 89, which is also 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in each ten's group. For example, in 10-19, the units digits go from 0-9, and the same pattern repeats for each ten's group. So, for each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. \n\nSince there are 9 ten's groups in two-digit numbers (10-99), each digit from 0-9 will appear 9 times in the units place. Wait, no, actually, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Each ten's group has 10 numbers, and each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place per ten's group. Since there are 9 ten's groups (10-19 up to 90-99), the digit 4 will appear 9 times in the units place. Similarly, 8 will also appear 9 times. \n\nWait, no, actually, that's not correct because the ten's groups go from 10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99, which is 9 groups, each contributing one occurrence of each digit in the units place. So, for the units place in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 9 times each. \n\nSo, adding up the two places (tens and units) for two-digit numbers:\n- Digit 4: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times\n- Digit 8: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I add the tens and units, both digits 4 and 8 have the same count, which is 19 each. But wait, when I think about the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly once per ten's group, and there are 9 ten's groups, so 9 times each. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well. So, total for two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, and same for 8. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, the difference in two-digit numbers is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These have hundreds, tens, and units places. I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds place:\n- Digit 4 appears in 400-488. The number of pages from 400 to 488 is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- Digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the highest hundreds digit is 4. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) will have different counts for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nLet me break it down by each hundred group:\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - Tens digit cycles from 0-9, so 4 appears in the tens place for 140-149, which is 10 times.\n   - Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place for 180-189, which is 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299:\n   - Similarly, 4 appears in the tens place for 240-249, 10 times.\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 280-289, 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399:\n   - 4 appears in the tens place for 340-349, 10 times.\n   - 8 appears in the tens place for 380-389, 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488:\n   - Here, the tens digit goes from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here.\n   - For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit is 8, and the units digits go from 0-8. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the tens digit can be from 0 to 8, so 480-488 is correct, giving 9 occurrences for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, let me add up the counts for the tens place across all hundreds groups:\n\n- For digit 4:\n  - 100-199: 10\n  - 200-299: 10\n  - 300-399: 10\n  - 400-488: 10\n  Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times.\n\n- For digit 8:\n  - 100-199: 10\n  - 200-299: 10\n  - 300-399: 10\n  - 400-488: 9\n  Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, I'll consider each hundreds group separately.\n\n1. 100-199:\n   - The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens group. So, for each ten's group (like 100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 4 appears 10 times in the units place.\n   - Similarly, 8 appears once in each ten's group, so 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299:\n   - Same as above. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. 300-399:\n   - Same. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. 400-488:\n   - Now, the units digit goes from 0-9 for each tens group, but the last tens group is 480-488, which only goes up to 8 in the units place. Let's see how this affects the count.\n   - For each ten's group (like 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digit cycles from 0-9 except for the last group, which only goes up to 8.\n   - So, for the ten's groups 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, each has 10 numbers, so 4 appears once in each ten's group's units place, and 8 appears once in each ten's group's units place. There are 8 ten's groups here (400-409 up to 470-479), so 8 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - Then, the last ten's group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480 to 488). So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). Wait, no, 480-488 includes 484 and 488, but actually, the units digits go from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in this last group, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Therefore, total for 400-488 in units place:\n     - 8 ten's groups (400-479) each contribute 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in units place: 8 times each.\n     - Plus 1 occurrence each in 480-488.\n     - So, total for 4: 8 + 1 = 9\n     - Total for 8: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each ten's group from 400-409 up to 470-479, that's 8 ten's groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place. So, 8 times each. Then, in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, the units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, that's 1 each. So, total for 4 in units place in 400-488 is 8 + 1 = 9, and same for 8.\n\nWait, but wait a second. For the ten's groups 400-409, 410-419, etc., up to 470-479, each has 10 numbers, so in each, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 8 ten's groups \u00d7 1 each = 8 times for 4 and 8.\n\nThen, in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, 484 is one occurrence of 4, and 488 is one occurrence of 8. So, that's 1 each, making the total for 4 in units place in 400-488 as 8 + 1 = 9, and same for 8.\n\nSo, adding up across all hundreds groups:\n\n- For digit 4:\n  - 100-199: 10\n  - 200-299: 10\n  - 300-399: 10\n  - 400-488: 9\n  Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\n- For digit 8:\n  - 100-199: 10\n  - 200-299: 10\n  - 300-399: 10\n  - 400-488: 9\n  Total: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the units place in 400-488, I calculated 9 times for each, but let me make sure. So, in 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, that's 8 ten's groups, each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 8 in the units place. Then, 480-488 contributes 1 each. So, 8 + 1 = 9 for each. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, in the units place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 39 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89 times\n  - 8: 0 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 40 times\n  - 8: 39 times\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 39 times\n  - 8: 39 times\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times\n- 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times\n\nWait, that seems off because the counts for 4 in three-digit numbers are much higher than 8. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so that's correct. 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 40 times for 4 and 39 times for 8, which seems correct because in 400-488, the tens digit for 8 only goes up to 8, and the units are limited, so 9 instead of 10.\n\nIn the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each, which seems correct.\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nNow, let's add up all the counts across all page number ranges.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal for 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal for 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake in the three-digit counts.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because pages 400-488 are 89 pages. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4, I had 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 10 in 400-488, totaling 40. For 8, it's 10 in each of the first three and 9 in 400-488, totaling 39. That seems correct.\n\nIn the units place, each hundreds group has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8, except the last one, which has 9 each. So, 10*3 +9=39 for each. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total for 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal for 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n4: 1 +19=20\n8:1 +19=20\n\nTotal overall:\n4:20 +168=188\n8:20 +78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a big number. Let me check if I counted correctly.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each digit place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, let's consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nFor units place:\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n- Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, total groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48 full groups, each contributing 1 occurrence, so 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last number, so the 49th group is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so 4 appears once in units place here as well. So, total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8 in units place: same logic. 488/10=48 full groups, each contributing 1 occurrence, and the last group 480-488 has 9 numbers, including 488, so 8 appears once in units place. So, total 8's in units place:48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but according to this, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. But earlier, I had 39 for three-digit numbers and 9 for single and two-digit? Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's think again. From 1 to 9: units digits 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nFrom 10 to 99: units digits 4 and 8 each appear 9 times (since each ten's group contributes once, and there are 9 ten's groups).\n\nFrom 100 to 488: units digits 4 and 8 each appear how many times?\n\nIn each hundred group, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten's group. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place.\n\nFor 400-488: how many full ten's groups? From 400-488, the ten's groups are 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. So, that's 9 ten's groups. Each contributes once for 4 and once for 8 in the units place, except the last group, which is 480-488, which has 9 numbers, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in 400-488, units place 4's: 9 (from 400-479) +1=10? Wait, no, because 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 full ten's groups (400-409 up to 480-488). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is 9 ten's groups: 400-409 (10), 410-419 (10), ..., 480-488 (9). So, in each of the first 8 ten's groups (400-409 to 470-479), 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place, and in 480-488, they each appear once. So, total for 400-488 in units place: 8*1 +1=9 for 4, and same for 8.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier approach where I thought it was 10. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach it differently. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) = 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, and then check if the remaining numbers (488 - 48*10=8) include a 4. Since 480-488 includes 484, which is a 4 in units place, so total 48 +1=49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and 480-488 includes 488, so 48 +1=49 times.\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I broke it down into single, two, and three-digit numbers, I had 49 for units place, but in the three-digit numbers, I had 39. That suggests I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let's recast:\n\nFrom 1-9: units digits 4 and 8 each appear once.\n\nFrom 10-99: units digits 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n\nFrom 100-488: units digits 4 and 8 each appear how many times?\n\nFrom 100-199: 10 times each.\n\nFrom 200-299: 10 times each.\n\nFrom 300-399: 10 times each.\n\nFrom 400-488: Let's see, 400-488 is 89 numbers. Each ten's group (like 400-409) has 10 numbers, so 400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479, and then 480-488. So, that's 9 ten's groups. In each, 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, except the last group, which has 9 numbers, so 480-488 includes 484 (units 4) and 488 (units 8). So, in 400-488, 4 appears 9 times (once per ten's group, including the last one where it's 484) and 8 appears 9 times (once per ten's group, including 488).\n\nSo, total units place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4: 10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) =39\n\nSimilarly, 8: same, 39.\n\nBut when I calculated from 1-488, I got 49 each. So, 1 (1-9) +9 (10-99) +39 (100-488) =49 for units place, which matches.\n\nSo, perhaps in my initial three-digit calculation, I correctly got 39 for units place in three-digit numbers, and adding the single and two-digit numbers, which contribute 1 and 9 respectively, gives 49 total.\n\nWait, but in the initial approach, I considered three-digit numbers as 100-488, so units place 4's are 39, and single and two-digit numbers add 1 and 9, totaling 49. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's move to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nAgain, considering each range:\n\nFrom 1-9: no tens digit, so 0.\n\nFrom 10-99: tens digits are 1-9. For each ten's digit, 4 and 8 each appear once in the tens place. So, for 10-99, 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nFrom 100-488: the tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundred group.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n100-199:\n- Tens digits 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\n200-299:\n- Same, 4 appears 10 times (240-249), 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n300-399:\n- Same, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n400-488:\n- Tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times. 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n\nSo, total for tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n4:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +10 (400-488) =40\n\n8:10 (100-199) +10 (200-299) +10 (300-399) +9 (400-488) =39\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit numbers:\n\nFrom 1-9: 0\nFrom 10-99: 10 each\n\nSo, total tens place:\n4:10 (two-digit) +40 (three-digit) =50\n8:10 (two-digit) +39 (three-digit) =49\n\nWait, but according to the earlier approach where I considered units place, the total for 4 in tens place would be 50, and for 8, 49.\n\nWait, but when I calculated earlier, I had 40 for 4 and 39 for 8 in three-digit tens place, and adding two-digit tens place 10 each, so total 50 and 49 respectively.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the units place, I had 49 each, so let's check that.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in the initial approach where I considered three-digit numbers and added up the hundreds, tens, and units. Let me try to recast the entire problem using the digit place approach.\n\nSo, total number of 4's and 8's can be calculated by looking at each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet's start with the units place:\n\n- 1-9: 4 appears once, 8 appears once.\n- 10-99: For each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. There are 9 ten's groups, so 9 times each.\n- 100-488: Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place for the first three hundreds, and 9 for the last hundred (since 480-488 is 9 numbers). So, 10*3 +9=39 for each.\n\nSo, total units place:\n4:1 +9 +39=49\n8:1 +9 +39=49\n\nNow, tens place:\n\n- 1-9: 0\n- 10-99: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- 100-488: Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place for the first three hundreds. For 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens place:\n4:10 (two-digit) +10*3 (three-digit first three hundreds) +10 (400-449) =10 +30 +10=50\n8:10 (two-digit) +10*3 (three-digit first three hundreds) +9 (480-488)=10 +30 +9=49\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- 1-99: 0\n- 100-488: 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n4:89\n8:0\n\nNow, summing up all digit places:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49 +50 +89=188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49 +49 +0=98\n\nDifference:188 -98=90\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nI think this is correct because when I broke it down by each digit place and summed up, I got 188 for 4's and 98 for 8's, with a difference of 90. Earlier, I was concerned I might have made a mistake, but this approach seems consistent.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once.\n   - '8' appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Units place:** Each digit appears 9 times (once per ten's group).\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears 10 times (40-49), '8' appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - Total for two-digit pages:\n     - '4': 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19.\n     - '8': 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears 89 times (400-488), '8' does not appear.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - '4' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 10 times in 400-449, totaling 40.\n     - '8' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 480-488, totaling 39.\n   - **Units place:** \n     - '4' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39.\n     - '8' appears similarly 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages:\n     - '4': 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - '8': 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n   - Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n4. **Total counts across all pages:**\n   - '4': 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - '8': 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from each group) plus 1 (since 484 has a 4 in the units place). Wait, but 484 is within the 481-488 range, so that's one more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). How many full blocks of 100 do we have? From 1-488, that's four full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. \n\nSo, in each full block, 10 times 4's in the tens place, so 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 0-8. Wait, no, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4, which is 10 times. But wait, in the partial block, we go up to 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 times. So, total in tens place: 40 (from full blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? Well, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488 inclusive. So, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yep.\n\nNow, onto the 8's. I'll do the same process.\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, similar to the 4's, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488? 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the partial group from 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once in this partial group (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). So, how many full blocks of 100 do we have? Four full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in this partial block, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's 9 times because 480, 481,...,488: that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Wait, but 480 is included, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the 4's, in the tens place, from 401-488, we had 10 times because 440-449 is 10 numbers. But here, in the 8's, from 480-488, it's 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first and 488 is the last, so 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 40 (from full blocks) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. So, in each full block of 100, 10 times 8 in the tens place. Four blocks, so 40. Then, in the partial block, 480-488: 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, let me add again: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. 49 + 49 = 98. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, counting 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each 10 numbers, 1 occurrence. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 has a 4, which is one more. So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). Four full blocks, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: Each 10 numbers, 1 occurrence. 48 full groups, 48. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8, so 1 more. Total units: 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: Each block of 100 has 10 occurrences in the tens place (e.g., 80-89). Four full blocks, 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? 480, 481,...,488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: Since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers from 800-899, so 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, difference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for the 8's. In the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Let me list them: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times 8 appears in the tens place. So, yes, 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, the partial block 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second. When I count the 4's in the hundreds place, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the steps and the counts seem accurate. So, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full groups of 10 (480 numbers) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In the units place, '4' appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each block of 100, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are four full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4\u00d710=40. In the partial block (401-488), '4' appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1). Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, '8' appears once every 10 numbers. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each block of 100, '8' appears 10 times. Four full blocks contribute 40. In the partial block (401-488), '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** There are no page numbers in 800-899, so '8' doesn't appear here. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Subtract the total number of '8's from '4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference between the two counts. That makes sense because each digit's occurrence depends on its position.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. The digit 4 appears once in every 10 numbers, same with 8. So, for each set of 10 pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. \n\nNow, for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding that, we get 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights in the units place. Wait, but that can't be right because from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, units place contributes 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 80-89, which is another 10 numbers. \n\nSince the book has 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages beyond that. So, let me correct that: the complete hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488.\n\nIn each of these complete hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (like 40-49 in 1-100, 140-149 in 101-200, etc.), so that's 10 fours each. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers each (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). \n\nSo, for each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. Since there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours and 40 eights from the tens place in the hundreds. \n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Wait, 401-488: let's see, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit is 1, ..., 481-490: tens digit is 8. But wait, 488 is the last page, so up to 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers instead of 10. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. Wait, but 401-488 includes 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? 440,441,...,449. So, that's 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480-488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. \n\nWait, but 480 is part of 401-488, so yes, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, adding that to the earlier 40 fours and 40 eights from the complete hundreds, the total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 9 = 49 eights. \n\nWait, but let me double-check: from 1-400, each hundred has 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 appears in 480-488 (9 times). So, yes, 10 fours and 9 eights. So total tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for each digit.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal fours = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal eights = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: From 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in units digit?\n\nEach 10 numbers have one 4 and one 8. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 +1 = 49 fours and 48 +1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49), so 10 fours per hundred. Similarly, 10 eights per hundred. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 fours and 40 eights. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 fours) and 8 in 480-488 (9 eights). So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 fours and 40 +9=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. No 8's in hundreds place. So, 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nAdding up:\n\nFours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nEights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98 =90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the hundreds place correctly calculated? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1 =89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nIs there any other place where 8 could appear in the hundreds? No, because the book ends at 488, so hundreds digit goes up to 4.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when considering 401-488, I considered 480-488 as 9 numbers. Let me check that: 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? From 480 to 488, that's 9 pages, so 9 eights in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about the tens place in 401-488: The tens digit cycles every 100, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-489). But since we stop at 488, the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the units place, I had 49 fours and 49 eights. Then, in tens place, 50 fours and 49 eights. So, total fours: 49+50+89=188, eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer would be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nBut let me think if there's another approach. Maybe instead of counting each digit, I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nAnother way: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n- For 4: Each 10 numbers have one 4. So, total fours in units place = floor(488/10) + (if the remainder is >=4, add 1). So, 48*1=48, and since 488 mod10=8 >=4, add 1, so 49 fours.\n- Similarly for 8: floor(488/10)=48, and since 8>=8, add 1, so 49 eights.\n\nTens place:\n- For 4: Each 100 numbers have 10 fours in the tens place. So, 488 /100=4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), how many tens digits are 4? The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so add 10. Total fours in tens place:40+10=50.\n- For 8: Similarly, 4*10=40 fours. In the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so add 9. Total eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For 4: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n- For 8: No hundreds digit is 8, so 0.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\nFours:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nEights:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total sets of 10: 48, contributing 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 four and 1 eight.\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - 4 full hundreds contribute 40 fours and 40 eights.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - Fours: 10 (440-449).\n     - Eights: 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Fours: 89 (400-488).\n   - Eights: 0.\n   - Total: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n- Eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (fours) - 98 (eights) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then an additional 8 numbers. \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for the digit 8. So, for 48 complete blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's is 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial block) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count of 4's and 8's is the same. \n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each block of 100. So, from 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. \n\nWait, let me clarify: from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in the 400s, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. So, the digit 4 appears only once in the tens place in this partial block, which is in 440-449. Wait, no, actually, 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4, but that's within the 400s. Wait, but 440-449 is part of the 400s, which we've already considered in the complete hundreds. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once for each hundred. But since we're only going up to 488, which is part of the 400s, the tens digit in 400s runs from 0 to 8, so the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 occurrences. So, in the partial block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 times (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does it occur? Each tens digit from 0 to 8 occurs 10 times except for the last one, which might be less if the total doesn't reach the next hundred. Wait, but 488 is 488, so from 401-488, that's 88 numbers. 88 divided by 10 is 8 full tens blocks, each of 10 numbers, and then 8 extra numbers. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). For each tens digit, how many numbers have that digit in the tens place? For tens digit 0: 401-410, which is 10 numbers. Tens digit 1: 411-420, 10 numbers. Similarly up to tens digit 7: 471-480, 10 numbers. Then, tens digit 8: 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers: 481-488. So, for the tens digit 8, it's 8 numbers. \n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 480 is one, then 481-488 is 8 more, so total 9 numbers. So, digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens digit 8 would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, for the tens place in the partial block (401-488), digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total for the tens place: digit 4 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial block) = 50 times. Digit 8 appears 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from partial block) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the complete hundreds each contribute 10 times for each digit in the tens place, so 4 complete hundreds would be 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in the partial block, digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 49, so 4's are 1 more than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4, not 8. So, digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 appears 0 times. So, that's a difference of 89 in favor of 4's.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference: 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference: +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each place to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 has one 4 in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks). So, 48 * 1 = 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 * 1 = 48, plus 488, so 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For digit 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. For digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 numbers. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0. Correct.\n\nAdding up the differences:\n\nUnits: 49-49=0\n\nTens:50-49=1\n\nHundreds:89-0=89\n\nTotal: 0+1+89=90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all page numbers correctly, including page 1-9, which are single-digit. In the units place, for single-digit pages, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). So, in the units place, from 1-9, 4 and 8 each appear once. Then, from 10-99, each digit appears 9 times in the units place (since for each ten, 4 and 8 appear once, and there are 9 tens). Wait, no, actually, from 10-99, there are 9 tens (10-19, 20-29,...90-99). Each ten has one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 9 * 1 = 9 each. So, from 10-99, 4's in units place:9, 8's:9.\n\nAdding single-digit pages: 4's:1, 8's:1.\n\nSo, total units place from 1-99: 4's=10, 8's=10.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated units place as 49 each, which would include 1-488. Wait, perhaps I should check my earlier calculation again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the units place calculation. Let me recalculate units place more carefully.\n\nTotal number of page numbers:488.\n\nUnits digit cycles every 10 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial cycle.\n\nNumber of complete cycles:488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete cycles (each contributing 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8 in the units place), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In these 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48*1 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place:48*1 +1=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 4*10=40 for each digit. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. For each tens digit, how many times does it appear? From 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits cycle through 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times (since 88 = 8*10 +8). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think differently.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears 8 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, but 401-488 is 88 numbers. Each tens digit from 0 to 8 would appear 10 times except the last one, which appears 8 times. Wait, no, that's not correct because 88 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 8. So, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and the last tens digit (8) appears 8 times. Wait, but that doesn't add up because 8 tens digits * 10 = 80, plus 8 more would be 88, which is correct.\n\nWait, but in reality, from 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in this partial block, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 numbers. The digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the partial block, digit 4 appears 10 times, and digit 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) +10 (from partial block) =50\n- Digit 8:4*10 +8=48\n\nWait, earlier I thought digit 8 appeared 9 times, but now it's 8 times. Wait, which is correct?\n\nLooking at 481-488, that's 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so 8 occurrences. Therefore, digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the partial block.\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4:50, digit 8:48. So, the difference in tens place is +2 for 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 50-49=1, but now it's 50-48=2. Hmm, I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, digit 8 in tens place:4*10=40 from complete hundreds, plus 8 from partial block, total 48.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in tens place:4*10=40 from complete hundreds, plus 10 from 441-450, total 50.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 48, so difference is +2.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 49 for 8's, but that was incorrect. It's 48.\n\nSo, let's correct the earlier calculations.\n\nUnits place:4's=49,8's=49.\n\nTens place:4's=50,8's=48.\n\nHundreds place:4's=89,8's=0.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but that's different from my earlier total of 90. So, I must have made a mistake in the tens place earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. So, in the partial block, digit 8 in tens place is 8, not 9. Therefore, total digit 8 in tens place is 4*10 +8=48.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in tens place in partial block is 10 (441-450). So, total 4's in tens place is 50.\n\nThus, units:49 each.\n\nTens:4's=50,8's=48.\n\nHundreds:4's=89,8's=0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, so that's 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check again the tens place in the partial block.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times because 488 is the last page.\n\nSo, digit 8 in tens place:8 times.\n\nSo, yes, 48 total for 8's in tens place.\n\nSimilarly, digit 4 in tens place:10 times in the partial block.\n\nSo, 50 total for 4's in tens place.\n\nTherefore, the difference in tens place is +2.\n\nAdding up:\n\nUnits:0\n\nTens:+2\n\nHundreds:+89\n\nTotal difference:91.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nHmm, so the correct difference is 91.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place. Let me check that again.\n\nUnits place: From 1-488, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete blocks:48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn the complete blocks, 48*1=48 for each digit.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nTotal 8's in units place:48+1=49.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, units place:49 each.\n\nTens place:4's=50,8's=48.\n\nHundreds place:4's=89,8's=0.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 90, but after correcting the tens place, it's 91. So, I think 91 is the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me check once more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then subtract.\n\nCalculating number of 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:50\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:48\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to count how many times a specific digit appears, like 4 or 8, I can break the problem down by the number of digits. Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and then find the difference. Let me start with the 4's.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers (1-9). The digit 4 appears once here, which is on page 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once on page 8. So, for one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in both the tens and units places separately.\n\nFor the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The 4 can be in the tens place for numbers 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears.\n- Similarly, the 8 can be in the tens place for numbers 80-89. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nFor the units place in two-digit numbers:\n- The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 times because from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. Wait, but 44 is already counted in the tens place, but since we're considering units place separately, does that matter? Hmm, maybe not because each occurrence is counted separately. So, from 10-99, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (since 44 is included, but we're just counting how many times 4 appears in the units place regardless of the tens digit). Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the units place as 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's also 9 times.\n\nWait, but wait, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. For the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times in the units place (since 90/10=9). So, for 4 and 8, each appears 9 times in the units place. So, in two-digit numbers, 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Similarly, 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, for two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each. So, the difference is zero again.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is where it gets a bit more complicated. Let me break it down by hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n- The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times for 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- For the tens place, each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has ten numbers for each ten's digit. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, each for 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, the tens digit can be 0-9, and for each digit, it appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the digit 4 in the tens place:\n- In each hundred, 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). But wait, for 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Let me check:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 4 appears in 140-149: 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: tens digit 4 appears in 240-249: 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: tens digit 4 appears in 340-349: 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: tens digit 4 appears in 440-449: 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, total for 4 in the tens place is 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place:\n- In each hundred, 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers, except in the last hundred (400-488), where the tens digit goes up to 8, so 8 in the tens place is 480-489, but the book ends at 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. Wait, no, 480 is the first, then 481, ..., up to 488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, let's calculate:\n\n- 100-199: tens digit 8 appears in 180-189: 10 numbers.\n- 200-299: tens digit 8 appears in 280-289: 10 numbers.\n- 300-399: tens digit 8 appears in 380-389: 10 numbers.\n- 400-488: tens digit 8 appears in 480-488: 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total for 8 in the tens place is 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check again. For 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 numbers. So, 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers:\n- For each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the units place. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and similarly for 8.\n\nBut wait, for the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8, but does that affect the count? Let me think.\n\nWait, no, because in each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, for example, in 100-199, each units digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in each ten's group. So, regardless of the hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the units place per hundred. But in the last hundred, 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8, but since 488 is the last page, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, no, because 400-488 includes 489? No, it's up to 488. So, in 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-8 in the last ten (480-488). So, for units digit 4 in 400-488, it appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, that's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 484 is included, but 488 is 8 in the units place, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place in 400-488.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each hundred, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. But wait, 488 is 488, so 484 is included. So, 9 times for units digit 4 in 400-488.\n\nWait, but in other hundreds, like 100-199, the units digit 4 appears 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194). Similarly, in 200-299, 204, 214, ..., 294: 10 times. In 300-399, 304, 314, ..., 394: 10 times. In 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times as above.\n\nSo, total for units digit 4 in three-digit numbers: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, for units digit 8 in three-digit numbers:\n\n- In each hundred except the last one, units digit 8 appears 10 times. For example, 108, 118, ..., 198: 10 times in 100-199.\n- In 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 times.\n- In 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 times.\n- In 400-488: units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included.\n\nSo, total for units digit 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, ..., 488. Let me count: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in three-digit numbers.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (as calculated earlier)\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\n- Tens place: 39 times\n- Units place: 39 times\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me double-check the tens and units places in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, earlier I thought that in the tens place for 4's, it's 10 times per hundred, so 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributing 10 times except maybe the last one. But in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 10 times each hundred, so 4 x 10 = 40 times. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so total 39 times. That's correct.\n\nFor units place, in 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times, so total 39 times for 4's and 39 times for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, which seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again, especially the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. The hundreds digit is 4 for 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place for 4's, I have 40 times, and units place 39 times. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, hundreds place is 0, tens place 39, units place 39, so 78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems quite a large number. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, for 4's, we have:\n\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 168\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Units: 39\nTotal: 78\n\nSo, 168 vs 78, difference of 90.\n\nBut let me check the units digit calculation again for three-digit numbers, especially for 400-488.\n\nIn 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times, correct.\n\nSo, units digit 4: 9 times in 400-488, plus 10 times in each of the other hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 10 x 3 = 30, plus 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nSame for units digit 8: 9 times in 400-488, plus 10 in each of the other hundreds, so 30 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nTens digit 4: 10 times in each hundred, so 4 x 10 = 40. Correct.\n\nTens digit 8: 10 times in each of the first three hundreds, and 9 times in the last, so 3 x 10 + 9 = 39. Correct.\n\nHundreds digit 4: 89 times, correct.\n\nSo, the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 188 - 98 = 90. That seems high, but maybe it's correct because in the three-digit numbers, 4's appear much more frequently, especially in the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the two-digit numbers. Let me check two-digit numbers again.\n\nIn two-digit numbers (10-99):\n\n- Tens digit 4: 10 numbers (40-49), so 10 times.\n- Units digit 4: 9 times (14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94). Wait, that's 9 times, not 10, because from 10-99, the units digit 4 appears in 14,24,...,94, which is 9 numbers (since 10-99 is 90 numbers, and 90/10=9). So, 9 times. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\n- Tens digit 8: 10 numbers (80-89), so 10 times.\n- Units digit 8: 9 times (18,28,...,98). So, 9 times.\nTotal 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm still a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but considering that in the three-digit numbers, 4's appear 89 times just in the hundreds place, which is a significant number, it might be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check: from 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - '4' appears once (page 4).\n   - '8' appears once (page 8).\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 40-49: 10 times.\n     - '8' appears in 80-89: 10 times.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94).\n     - '8' appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit numbers:\n     - '4': 10 + 9 = 19.\n     - '8': 10 + 9 = 19.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in 400-488: 89 times.\n     - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times in each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488): 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - '8' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488: 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - '4' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488: 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n     - '8' appears 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488: 3 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 39.\n   - Total for three-digit numbers:\n     - '4': 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n     - '8': 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n   - Difference in three-digit numbers: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n4. **Total Count Across All Pages:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n   - **Total '8's:** 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'. \n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For the single-digit pages (1-9), the digit 4 appears once (page 4) and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, in the units place, from 1 to 9, 4 and 8 each appear once. \n\nNow, moving on to two-digit numbers (10-99). In the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each block of ten numbers. For example, in 10-19, the units digits go from 0-9, so 4 appears once (14) and 8 appears once (18). The same pattern repeats for each subsequent block of ten up to 90-99. So, how many blocks are there? From 10-99, that's 9 blocks (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, for the units place in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 9 times (once in each block) and the same for 8. \n\nWait, but in the single-digit pages, we already counted one 4 and one 8. So, in the units place overall, from 1-99, 4 appears 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) = 10 times, and 8 appears 1 + 9 = 10 times. So, same number of 4's and 8's in the units place up to page 99.\n\nNow, let's check the tens place for two-digit numbers. In the tens place, each digit from 1-9 appears 10 times. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, in 80-89, the tens digit is 8 for all ten numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (pages 40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (pages 80-89). \n\nBut wait, in the single-digit pages, the tens place doesn't exist, so we don't count any 4's or 8's there. So, in the tens place from 1-99, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 10 times. \n\nSo, combining units and tens places from 1-99, 4 appears 10 (units) + 10 (tens) = 20 times, and 8 appears 10 (units) + 10 (tens) = 20 times. So, up to page 99, 4 and 8 are equal in count.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100-488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nNow, for the digit 4 in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place: looking at pages 800-899, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with hundreds digit 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in this book. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place for three-digit numbers. The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. But since we're dealing with 100-488, we need to be careful with the last hundred (400-488).\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Pages 100-199: The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each (e.g., 100-109, 110-119, ..., 190-199). So, for each digit 0-9 in the tens place, it appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\n2. Pages 200-299: Similarly, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n3. Pages 300-399: Same pattern, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n4. Pages 400-488: Now, this is a partial hundred. The tens digit goes from 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, let's see. The tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears only 9 times (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, let me check that.\n\nActually, from 400-488, the tens digits are 0-8, each appearing 10 times for tens digits 0-7, and for tens digit 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, for the tens place in 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, putting it all together for the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449). So, total for 4 in tens place is 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nBut for 8 in the tens place:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times (180-189)\n- 200-299: 10 times (280-289)\n- 300-399: 10 times (380-389)\n- 400-488: 9 times (480-488)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, so 4 appears 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 39 times. So, 4 has one more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers (100-488). Again, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 pages. So, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nBut again, for 400-488, we have to check if the units digit cycles fully or not.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Pages 100-199: Each units digit 0-9 appears 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. Pages 200-299: Same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n3. Pages 300-399: Same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n4. Pages 400-488: Let's see how many complete decades there are. From 400-488, that's 89 pages. 89 divided by 10 is 8 full decades (400-479) and 9 extra pages (480-488). So, in the units place:\n\n- For each full decade (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479), each digit 0-9 appears once. So, 8 full decades mean each digit appears 8 times. So, 4 appears 8 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n\n- Now, the last 9 pages: 480-488. The units digits here are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, in the units place for 400-488:\n\n  - 4: 8 (from full decades) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9 times\n  - 8: 8 (from full decades) + 1 (from 488) = 9 times\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, units digits are 0-8, which is 9 digits. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for 400-488 in units place:\n\n- 4: 8 + 1 = 9\n- 8: 8 + 1 = 9\n\nSo, in the units place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times\n- 8 appears 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times\n\nSo, in the units place, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For 400-488 in units place, I had 8 full decades (400-479) which is 80 pages, so each digit 0-9 appears 8 times. Then, the last 9 pages (480-488) add one more 4 and one more 8. So, total for 400-488 units place: 8 +1 =9 for both 4 and 8.\n\nSo, total units place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 10+10+10+9=39\n- 8: 10+10+10+9=39\n\nSo, same number of 4's and 8's in the units place for three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts for 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-99, 10 times; from 100-488, 39 times. So, total units: 10 + 39 = 49\n- Tens place: From 1-99, 10 times; from 100-488, 40 times. So, total tens: 10 + 40 = 50\n- Hundreds place: From 1-99, 0 times; from 100-488, 89 times (since 400-488). So, total hundreds: 0 +89=89\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)= 188\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\n- Units place: From 1-99, 10 times; from 100-488, 39 times. So, total units: 10 +39=49\n- Tens place: From 1-99, 10 times; from 100-488, 39 times. So, total tens:10 +39=49\n- Hundreds place: From 1-99, 0 times; from 100-488, 0 times (since no pages have hundreds digit 8). So, total hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+49 (tens)+0=98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 (4's) minus 98 (8's) would be 90. But let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 40 times for 4's and 39 times for 8's. So, total for 4's in tens place:10 (from 1-99) +40=50\n\nFor 8's in tens place:10 (from 1-99) +39=49\n\nSimilarly, units place for 4's:10 (1-99)+39=49\n\nUnits place for 8's:10 +39=49\n\nHundreds place for 4's:89\n\nHundreds place for 8's:0\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for three-digit numbers. For 4's in the tens place, I had 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 3*10=30, plus 10 in 400-488 (440-449), so total 40. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place: 10 in each of the first three hundreds, so 3*10=30, plus 9 in 400-488 (480-488), so total 39. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place for three-digit numbers: 4's and 8's each have 39, so units total 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, yes, 4's total 188, 8's total 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the units place for three-digit numbers?\n\nWait, in 400-488, units place: for 4's, it's 9 times, as I had 8 from 400-479 and 1 from 484. Similarly, 8's are 9 times, from 8 in 488. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the 400-488 range. So, 400-488 is 89 pages. So, in the units place, for each full set of 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, 8 full sets (400-479) is 80 pages, so each digit appears 8 times. Then, the last 9 pages (480-488) have units digits 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total for 400-488 in units place:8+1=9 for 4, and 8+1=9 for 8.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449 (10 times), and 8 for 480-488 (9 times, since 480-488 is 9 pages). So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the 400-488 range again. 400-488 is 89 pages. So, 400 is page 400, 401, ..., 488. So, 488-400+1=89 pages.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nIn the units place, 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's:98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count anything. For example, in the two-digit numbers, I counted 10 times each for 4's and 8's in the units and tens places. Then, in the three-digit numbers, I added the counts for each digit place.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is to consider each digit place separately across all pages.\n\nLet me try that approach to verify.\n\nFirst, units place across all pages (1-488):\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place every 10 pages. So, for 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, there are 8 remaining pages (481-488), which have units digits 1-8. So, in these remaining pages, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48*1 +1=49\n\nTotal 8's in units place:48*1 +1=49\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, tens place across all pages (1-488):\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 89 pages, so it's a partial hundred.\n\nFor each full hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 3 full hundreds (100-399) contribute 3*10=30 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8, each appearing 10 times for 0-7, and 9 times for 8 (since 480-488 is 9 pages). So, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449)\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488)\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:30 (from 1-399) +10=40\n\nTotal 8's in tens place:30 (from 1-399) +9=39\n\nSame as before.\n\nNow, hundreds place across all pages (1-488):\n\nThe hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199 (100 pages), 2 for 200-299 (100 pages), 3 for 300-399 (100 pages), and 4 for 400-488 (89 pages). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place:89\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place:0\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:40\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+40+89=178\n\nWait, wait, that's different from before. Wait, earlier I had 188, but now I'm getting 178. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered 1-99 separately, then 100-488. But in this second approach, I considered all pages together.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me see.\n\nIn the first approach, for 1-99:\n\n- Units place:10 each for 4 and 8\n- Tens place:10 each for 4 and 8\nSo, total for 1-99:20 each for 4 and 8\n\nThen, for 100-488:\n\n- Units place:39 each for 4 and 8\n- Tens place:40 for 4, 39 for 8\n- Hundreds place:89 for 4, 0 for 8\n\nSo, total for 100-488:\n\n4's:39 (units) +40 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=168\n\n8's:39 (units) +39 (tens)+0=78\n\nThen, total 4's:20 (1-99) +168=188\n\nTotal 8's:20 (1-99)+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nBut in the second approach, when I considered all pages together:\n\nUnits place:49 each\n\nTens place:40 for 4,39 for 8\n\nHundreds place:89 for 4,0 for 8\n\nSo, total 4's:49+40+89=178\n\n8's:49+39+0=88\n\nDifference:178-88=90\n\nWait, but that's inconsistent because 188-98=90 and 178-88=90. Wait, but 178+88=266, while 188+98=286. There's a discrepancy here. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let me check the first approach again. For 1-99:\n\n- Units place:10 each\n- Tens place:10 each\nTotal:20 each\n\nFor 100-488:\n\n- Units place:39 each\n- Tens place:40 for 4,39 for 8\n- Hundreds place:89 for 4,0 for 8\n\nSo, 4's:20+39+40+89=188\n\n8's:20+39+39+0=98\n\nWait, that's 20 (units 1-99) +39 (units 100-488)=59? Wait, no, I think I'm adding incorrectly.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I think I added the 1-99 and 100-488 separately for each digit place, but perhaps I should sum each digit place across all pages.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the first approach, I considered 1-99 and 100-488 separately, but in the second approach, I considered all pages together. Let me try to reconcile these.\n\nWait, in the first approach:\n\n- For 1-99:\n\n  - Units:10 each\n  - Tens:10 each\n  - Total:20 each\n\n- For 100-488:\n\n  - Units:39 each\n  - Tens:40 for 4,39 for 8\n  - Hundreds:89 for 4,0 for 8\n\nSo, total 4's:20 (1-99) +39 (units 100-488) +40 (tens 100-488) +89 (hundreds 100-488)=20+39+40+89=188\n\nSimilarly, total 8's:20 (1-99) +39 (units 100-488) +39 (tens 100-488)=20+39+39=98\n\nIn the second approach:\n\n- Units place across all pages:49 each\n- Tens place:40 for 4,39 for 8\n- Hundreds place:89 for 4,0 for 8\n\nSo, total 4's:49+40+89=178\n\n8's:49+39+0=88\n\nWait, but 178 vs 188, and 88 vs 98. There's a discrepancy of 10 in both counts. That suggests that in one of the approaches, I double-counted or missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps in the first approach, I'm double-counting the 1-99 and 100-488. Wait, no, because 1-99 and 100-488 are separate ranges.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me calculate the total number of 4's and 8's by considering each digit place across all pages, without splitting into ranges.\n\nFor units place:\n\nTotal number of pages:488\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. So, 488 /10=48.8, so each digit appears 48 times in the units place, plus an extra 8 digits (since 488=48*10 +8). So, for digits 0-8, they appear 49 times each, and 9 appears 48 times. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is as follows:\n\nFor each complete set of 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, 488 pages mean 48 complete sets of 10 pages, which is 480 pages, plus 8 extra pages (481-488).\n\nSo, in the units place:\n\n- Digits 0-8 appear 48 times (from the complete sets) plus once in the extra 8 pages. So, 48+1=49 times each.\n\n- Digit 9 appears 48 times (from the complete sets) plus zero times in the extra 8 pages, so 48 times.\n\nWait, but 481-488 have units digits 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once more, while 0 appears once more in 480. So, digits 0-8 appear 49 times each, and 9 appears 48 times.\n\nSo, 4 appears 49 times in the units place, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). But 400-488 is 89 pages, so it's a partial hundred.\n\nFor each full hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 3 full hundreds contribute 3*10=30 times each for digits 0-9.\n\nNow, for the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0-8, each appearing 10 times for 0-7, and 9 times for 8 (since 480-488 is 9 pages). So, in the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7:10 times each\n- Digit 8:9 times\n- Digit 9:0 times\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7:30 (from full hundreds) +10=40 times each\n- Digit 8:30 +9=39 times\n- Digit 9:30 +0=30 times\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the partial hundred, digits 0-8 appear in the tens place, but digit 9 doesn't. So, for the tens place across all pages:\n\n- Digits 0-7:40 times each\n- Digit 8:39 times\n- Digit 9:30 times\n\nSo, for digit 4 (which is in 0-7), it appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\nFor digit 8, it appears 39 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n\nDigits 1,2,3,4 appear in the hundreds place. Each appears for 100 pages (except for 4, which appears only up to 488). So:\n\n- Digit 1:100-199, 100 pages\n- Digit 2:200-299, 100 pages\n- Digit 3:300-399, 100 pages\n- Digit 4:400-488, 89 pages\n\nSo, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and digits 1,2,3 appear 100 times each. Digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:40\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+40+89=178\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:39\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+39+0=88\n\nDifference:178-88=90\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I got 188-98=90, and in the second approach, I get 178-88=90. So, the difference is the same, but the total counts are different. That suggests that in the first approach, I might have miscounted somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check the first approach again. In the first approach, I considered 1-99 and 100-488 separately.\n\nFor 1-99:\n\n- Units place:10 each\n- Tens place:10 each\nTotal:20 each\n\nFor 100-488:\n\n- Units place:39 each\n- Tens place:40 for 4,39 for 8\n- Hundreds place:89 for 4,0 for 8\n\nSo, total 4's:20+39+40+89=188\n\n8's:20+39+39=98\n\nBut in the second approach, considering all pages together, I got 4's=178 and 8's=88.\n\nWait, the discrepancy is 10. So, perhaps in the first approach, I overcounted the 1-99 range.\n\nWait, let's think: in the first approach, I considered 1-99 as single-digit and two-digit numbers. In the units place, 4 and 8 each appear once in single-digit (4 and 8), and in the tens place, each appears 10 times in two-digit numbers (40-49 and 80-89). So, total for 1-99:\n\n- Units:1+9=10 for each\n- Tens:9+1=10 for each? Wait, no, in the two-digit numbers, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 times in tens place, 8 appears 10 times in tens place. Plus, in single-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, total for 1-99:\n\n- Units:1 (single-digit) +9 (two-digit)=10 for each\nWait, no, in two-digit numbers, the units digit for 4 and 8 appears once per ten numbers, so from 10-99, each digit appears 9 times in the units place (10-99 is 90 numbers, 9 sets of 10). Wait, no, 10-99 is 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10, so each digit appears 9 times in the units place. Plus, in single-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units place for 1-99:9+1=10 for each.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for two-digit numbers, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times, and 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times. So, total tens place for 1-99:10 each.\n\nSo, in the first approach, 1-99:\n\n- Units:10 each\n- Tens:10 each\nTotal:20 each\n\nBut in the second approach, when considering all pages together, the units place for 1-99 is 10 each, and the tens place is 10 each, which adds up to 20 each.\n\nBut in the second approach, when considering all pages, the units place for 4 and 8 is 49 each, which includes 10 from 1-99 and 39 from 100-488.\n\nSimilarly, tens place:40 for 4 and 39 for 8, which includes 10 from 1-99 and 30 from 100-399, plus 10 or 9 from 400-488.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is that in the first approach, I added 20 (1-99) +39 (100-488) for units place, which is 59, but in reality, the units place across all pages is 49 each.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Wait, in the first"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then this pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, which is 488 pages. So, I need to see how many complete sets of ten there are and if there's a partial set at the end.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in each ten's position for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, from 10-19, the tens digit is 1, from 20-29 it's 2, and so on. \n\nFor the hundreds place, since the book goes up to 488, the hundreds digit will be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Specifically, from 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; and 400-488 is 4.\n\nWait, but I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each position. So, maybe I should handle each digit position one by one, starting with units, then tens, then hundreds.\n\nLet me start with the units place.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nIn each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, 1-10, 11-20, ..., up to 481-490. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last set is 481-488, which is only 8 numbers. Hmm, so I need to adjust for that.\n\nFirst, let me calculate how many complete sets of 10 there are in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets (from 1-480) and then a partial set from 481-488.\n\nIn each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for each complete set, both 4 and 8 contribute one count each in the units place.\n\nSo, for 48 complete sets (1-480), the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the same for 8's.\n\nNow, the partial set from 481-488. Let's list the units digits: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in this partial set, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, that adds 1 to each count.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, for the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake? Let me check again.\n\nWait, 488 is the last page, so the units digits go up to 8. So, from 481-488, the units digits are 1 through 8, so 484 is 4 in the units place, and 488 is 8. So yes, that's correct. So, units place contributes 49 each for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nTens digit:\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in a block of 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times in each hundred.\n\nBut again, our book goes up to 488, so we have to consider the hundreds, tens, and units accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. Wait, maybe I should handle the tens place first.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider each hundred block separately.\n\nSo, from 1-99: the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place, except for 0, which appears 9 times because from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but page 1 is just 1, so maybe it's 9 times? Wait, no, actually, from 1-9, the tens digit is 0, so that's 9 times. But from 10-99, the tens digits go from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So, total for 1-99: tens digits 0 appears 9 times, and 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again. For the tens place, in each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9 (9 numbers), 1 for 10-19 (10 numbers), 2 for 20-29 (10 numbers), ..., up to 9 for 90-99 (10 numbers). So, actually, 0 appears 9 times, and 1-9 each appear 10 times in the tens place for the first hundred.\n\nSimilarly, in the next hundred, 101-200, the tens digit cycles similarly: 0 for 101-109 (9 numbers), 1 for 110-119 (10), etc. So, again, 0 appears 9 times, and 1-9 each appear 10 times.\n\nWait, but in our case, the book goes up to 488, so let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds blocks:\n\n1-99: tens digits as above.\n\n100-199: same as 1-99, but shifted by 100.\n\n200-299: same again.\n\n300-399: same.\n\n400-488: partial block.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nStarting with 1-99:\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49: that's 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in 80-89: 10 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in 1-99, the tens digit 0 appears 9 times, but for 4 and 8, they each appear 10 times in the tens place because they are from 40-49 and 80-89, which are full decades.\n\nWait, but in 1-99, the tens digit for 40-49 is 4, which is 10 times, and similarly for 80-89, 10 times. So, in 1-99, both 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving to 100-199:\n\nSimilarly, the tens digits go from 0 to 9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears in 140-149: 10 times, and 8 appears in 180-189: 10 times.\n\nSame for 200-299: 4 appears in 240-249: 10 times, and 8 in 280-289: 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 300-399: 4 appears in 340-349: 10 times, and 8 in 380-389: 10 times.\n\nNow, 400-488:\n\nIn this range, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here.\n\nFirst, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, each appearing 10 times except possibly the last one if it's partial.\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages. So, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). Wait, 400-409 is 10 pages, 410-419 another 10, ..., up to 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488). So, the tens digit 0 appears 10 times, 1 appears 10 times, ..., up to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages).\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-409 is 10 pages, so tens digit 0: 10 times.\n\n410-419: tens digit 1: 10 times.\n\n420-429: tens digit 2: 10 times.\n\n430-439: tens digit 3: 10 times.\n\n440-449: tens digit 4: 10 times.\n\n450-459: tens digit 5: 10 times.\n\n460-469: tens digit 6: 10 times.\n\n470-479: tens digit 7: 10 times.\n\n480-488: tens digit 8: 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 pages: 480,481,...,488).\n\nSo, in the tens place in 400-488:\n\n- 4 appears in 440-449: 10 times.\n\n- 8 appears in 480-488: 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place:\n\nFrom 1-399, each hundred block contributes 10 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 3 blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) each contribute 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 3 * 10 = 30 each.\n\nThen, in 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (in 480-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, so 4's have 40 and 8's have 39 in the tens place. So, 4's are ahead by 1 here.\n\nNow, let me check if I did that correctly. From 1-99: 10 each. 100-199: 10 each. 200-299: 10 each. 300-399: 10 each. So, that's 4 blocks, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40 for 4's, but wait, no, wait: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: that's four blocks, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's. But wait, in 400-488, 4's in tens place is 10, and 8's is 9. So, total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that can't be right because earlier I thought 1-399 had 3 blocks. Wait, maybe I miscounted the blocks.\n\nWait, 1-99 is the first block, 100-199 is the second, 200-299 third, 300-399 fourth. So, four blocks in total up to 399. So, each block contributes 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for 4's and 4*10=40 for 8's in the tens place up to 399.\n\nThen, in 400-488, the tens place for 4 is 440-449, which is 10 times, so total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, in 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems different from my earlier calculation. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in 400-488, the tens digit for 4 is 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, up to 399, we have 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, adding the 10 from 400-488, total 50 for 4's in tens place.\n\nFor 8's, up to 399, we have 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 40. Then, in 400-488, 8's in tens place are in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. So, 4's are ahead by 1 in the tens place.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, moving on.\n\nNow, let's consider the hundreds place.\n\nHundreds digit:\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears in the book because the book goes up to 488. So, let's see how many times each digit appears.\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they are two-digit numbers). So, 0 appears 99 times, but since we're only considering page numbers, maybe we don't count leading zeros. So, perhaps in the hundreds place, 0 doesn't count because it's not printed. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit printed, so the hundreds place is blank or not present. Therefore, in the hundreds place, digits only start appearing from page 100 onwards.\n\nSo, from 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages).\n\nWait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n\nNow, we need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nLooking at the hundreds digits:\n\n- 1 appears 100 times (100-199).\n\n- 2 appears 100 times (200-299).\n\n- 3 appears 100 times (300-399).\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n\nNow, 8 appears in the hundreds place only if there's a page number from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nOn the other hand, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTherefore, the difference in the hundreds place is 89 - 0 = 89.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- 4's: 49\n\n- 8's: 49\n\nDifference: 0\n\nTens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n\n- 8's: 49\n\nDifference: +1\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89\n\n- 8's: 0\n\nDifference: +89\n\nNow, total difference is the sum of differences in each place.\n\nSo, units: 0\n\nTens: +1\n\nHundreds: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, so 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in units place.\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nTotal complete tens: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens).\n\nEach contributes 1 to 4 and 8, so 48 each.\n\nThen, the partial ten: 481-488, which has units digits 1-8.\n\nSo, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488).\n\nThus, total 4's in units: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSame for 8's: 49.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-99: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\n100-199: same, 4 appears 10 times (140-149), 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\n200-299: same, 4 appears 10 times (240-249), 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n300-399: same, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n400-488: 4 appears 10 times (440-449), 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds (1-399), each contributes 10 for 4 and 10 for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, 10 each: 4*10=40 for 4's, and same for 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 3 blocks, but no, it's 4 blocks: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399. So, 4 blocks, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nThen, in 400-488, 4's in tens place: 10 (440-449), 8's: 9 (480-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nThus, difference in tens place: +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times.\n\nDifference: +89.\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nSo, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just check if I counted the hundreds correctly.\n\nFrom 400-488: 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, yes, 89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's have 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's have 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, 4's are printed 90 times more than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 480 pages, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) contribute one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Difference:** 0\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times in each block of 100.\n   - For 1-399, there are four blocks (1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8.\n   - **Total for 1-399:** 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n   - In 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n   - **Difference:** +1\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n   - **Difference:** +89\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +1\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - **Total:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 times more than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) separately and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the counts for 4 and 8, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let me consider each place value one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, since the book goes up to 488, I need to figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial block at the end.\n\nThe total number of pages is 488, so dividing that by 10 gives 48 complete blocks and 8 extra pages. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from each complete block) plus 1 if the last partial block includes a 4 in the units place. Wait, the last page is 488, so the last page in the units place is 8, not 4. So, actually, the units place would have 48 fours. Hmm, wait, no, let me think again. Each block of 10 contributes one 4 in the units place. So from 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 fours. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's no 4 in the units place here. So total units place 4's are 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 pages, from 40-49 in each hundred. For example, pages 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, 140-149, 240-249, etc. So how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1-488, we can think of it as 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49). So that's 4 times 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place from the first four hundreds.\n\nBut wait, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so in this range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is another 10 pages. So that's 10 more fours in the tens place. So total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last hundred is 401-488, which is 88 pages. So in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but 40-49 in the tens place would be 440-449, which is 10 pages. So yes, that's correct, adding 10 more fours in the tens place. So total tens place fours are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from page 400 to 488. So how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nSo total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds. That would be 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1-488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (as 488 / 10 = 48.8). So each block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 eights. Now, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit is 8 here. So that's one more 8 in the units place. So total units place eights are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488. So each complete hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. Let's see how many hundreds we have.\n\nFrom 1-488, the hundreds with 8 in the tens place are:\n\n- 80-89: 10 pages\n- 180-189: 10 pages\n- 280-289: 10 pages\n- 380-389: 10 pages\n- 480-488: 9 pages (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the number of 8's is 4 times 10 (from the first four blocks) plus 9 from the last partial block. So 4*10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So total tens place eights are 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So hundreds place eights are 0.\n\nSo total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so total 98 eights.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 fours. Because from 1-480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. Then 481-488 doesn't add any more units place 4's. So 48.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 more. So 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nNow for the 8's:\n\n- Units place: Each block of 10 contributes one 8, so 48 blocks give 48 eights. Then from 481-488, the last page is 488, so units digit 8, so one more. Total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 more. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: None, as we don't reach 800. So 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I think about the units place for 8's, from 1-488, the number of 8's should be 49, right? Because 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and one partial block, which includes 488, so that's 49.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, etc., each contributing 10 eights, but in the last block, 480-488, only 9 pages have 8 in the tens place. So 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo yes, 49 in units and 49 in tens, total 98.\n\nSo the difference is indeed 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to miscount. Let me try another approach for the 4's and 8's to cross-verify.\n\nAnother way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit position separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in that position across all numbers up to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place for 4:\n\n- For units digit 4, the numbers are 4,14,24,...,484. Now, how many such numbers are there? The last one is 484, which is 4 + 10*(n-1) = 484. So 10*(n-1) = 480, so n-1=48, so n=49. Wait, but 484 is the 49th number? Wait, no, because starting from 4, each step is 10, so the count is floor((488 - 4)/10) + 1 = floor(484/10) +1=48 +1=49. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's see: from 1 to 488, how many numbers have 4 in the units place? The first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. The last one is 484, which is 4 + 10*(48) = 484. So that's 49 numbers, meaning 49 fours in the units place. But earlier, I thought it was 48. So which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is equal to the number of numbers congruent to 4 mod 10. So the first is 4, then 14,24,...,484. Now, 484 is the 49th term because (484 - 4)/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So that's 49 fours in the units place. So earlier, I thought it was 48, but actually, it's 49. Hmm, so that changes things.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that from 1-480, there are 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours. Then from 481-488, no fours in the units place. So total 48. But according to this calculation, it's 49. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting the blocks. Let's think differently. The number of units digits 4 is equal to the number of complete decades (blocks of 10) plus any extra in the last partial block.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete decades: floor(488/10) = 48. Each complete decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48.\n\nNow, the last partial decade is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. Do any of these have a units digit of 4? 484 is within this range, so that's one more 4. So total units place 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSo that's correct. So earlier, I must have miscounted. So units place 4's are 49, not 48.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I thought of 480 as the last page with 4 in the units place, I thought that was 484, but actually, 484 is within 481-488, so it's included. So units place 4's are 49.\n\nSimilarly, let's recalculate the tens place for 4.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks contributes 10 fours in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10\n- 240-249: 10\n- 340-349: 10\n- 440-449: 10\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought of 4 blocks, but now it's 5 blocks. Wait, no, from 1-400, there are four hundreds, each contributing a 40-49 block, so 4 blocks, each with 10 fours, totaling 40. Then from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, which is another 10 fours, so total 50.\n\nWait, so that's correct. So tens place 4's: 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So 89.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nWait, earlier I had 187, but now it's 188. So I must have made a mistake before. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I calculated the units place 4's as 48, I thought the last partial block didn't include a 4, but now I see it does include 484, so units place 4's are 49.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's check the 8's again.\n\nUnits place 8's: From 1-488, how many numbers have 8 in the units place? The numbers are 8,18,28,...,488. So the first is 8, last is 488.\n\nNumber of such numbers: ((488 - 8)/10) +1 = (480/10)+1=48+1=49. So 49 units place 8's.\n\nTens place 8's: Numbers where tens digit is 8. These are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488.\n\nEach of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 numbers, so 4*10=40. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place 8's: None, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo now, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let's check that again.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours.\n\nSo 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188 fours.\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nSo 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so the correct answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 89. So I must have miscounted the units place 4's earlier.\n\nWait, let me check units place 4's again.\n\nNumbers with 4 in units place: 4,14,24,...,484.\n\nHow many terms? The nth term is 4 + (n-1)*10 \u2264488.\n\nSo 4 +10(n-1) \u2264488 \u21d210(n-1) \u2264484 \u21d2n-1 \u226448.4 \u21d2n\u226449.4, so n=49.\n\nSo 49 numbers, so 49 fours in units place.\n\nSo yes, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. So I need to make sure.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nYes, 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\nTotal:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo the correct answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think earlier I miscounted the units place 4's as 48 instead of 49, leading to the incorrect difference of 89. So after correcting that, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears than the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers.

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. In each set of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (at page 8). \n\nBut wait, the book goes up to 488, so I need to see how many full sets of 10 there are and then any remaining pages. Let me calculate how many full decades there are. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full decades with 8 remaining pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nIn each full decade, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for 48 full decades, that's 48 times each. Now, the remaining 8 pages are 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total for units place is 48+1=49 for 4's and 48+1=49 for 8's. So, in the units place, they are equal, each appearing 49 times.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49 (10 times) and 8 for pages 80-89 (10 times). \n\nSo, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages left (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4*10=40 times each. Now, let's check the remaining 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn the tens place for 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Wait, no, actually, 401-499 would be the next set, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, but let's think carefully. From 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which might be cut short. Wait, no, 401-410 is 10 numbers (401-410), 411-420 is another 10, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Hmm, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining pages. Wait, but let me check: 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 numbers; 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 numbers; ... 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 numbers; 481-490 would be tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here. Wait, no, 481-490 is 10 numbers, but we only have up to 488, so from 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times in the remaining 88 pages. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 numbers, and for 8, there are 8 numbers. So, the digit 4 in the tens place would appear in 440-449, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 in the tens place would appear in 480-488, which is 9 times? Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. Wait, no, 480 is included, so 480 is the first, and 488 is the last, so that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the remaining pages. \n\nWait, but let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-490: tens digit 8 (but only up to 488, so 8 numbers: 481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place:\n- For 4: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the remaining pages = 50\n- For 8: 4 full hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the remaining pages = 48\n\nWait, but wait, in the full hundreds, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, right? So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining pages, 401-488, as above, 4's in tens place: 10 times, and 8's: 8 times. So, total for tens place:\n- 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nOkay, so in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summing up the hundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow, for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nWait, wait a minute, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 49 for both 4's and 8's. Then, in the tens place, I had 50 for 4's and 48 for 8's. In the hundreds place, 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's. So, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49+48=97\n\nSo, 188 4's and 97 8's. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. I had 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nAnd in the units place, from 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. Let me confirm that. For units place, each digit appears floor(488/10) times, which is 48 times, plus one more if the digit is less than or equal to 488 mod 10. 488 mod 10 is 8, so digits 1-8 appear 49 times, and 9 and 0 appear 48 times. Wait, but wait, that might not be accurate because the first page is 1, not 0. So, actually, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, and digits 1-8 appear one more time because 488 ends with 8. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as follows: For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to n is floor((n + 1 - d)/10). So, for d=4, it's floor((488 + 1 - 4)/10) = floor(485/10) = 48. Similarly, for d=8, it's floor((488 +1 -8)/10)=floor(481/10)=48. But wait, that would suggest 48 times each, but earlier I thought it was 49 times. Hmm, maybe my initial approach was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to consider that for each page from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since 488 is less than 490, the last decade is incomplete. Each full decade has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 full decades contribute 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, the remaining pages are 489-488? Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so after 480, the next pages are 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, in these 8 pages, the units digits are 1-8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units digits: 48 +1=49 for 4's and 48 +1=49 for 8's. So, that part was correct.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each.\n\nTens place: 4's: 50, 8's:48.\n\nHundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. Correct. And 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 at max. So, 8's in hundreds place:0.\n\nSo, yeah, the difference is 91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place, I thought the remaining pages after 400 would have 8's in the tens place, but perhaps I miscalculated. Let me go through the tens place again.\n\nIn the tens place, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 8 appear?\n\nAs I listed before, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490). But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 8 times in the remaining pages. So, in the tens place, 8's total is 40 (from full hundreds) +8=48. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in the remaining pages, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. So, 4's in tens place:40+10=50.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the difference is 91.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, 10 times. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 480-488, and 4 for 440-449. Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0, 1, 2, ..., 8. So, in this partial block, the tens digit is 4 only once, from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's indeed 89 numbers because 488 - 400 = 88, and adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks and an extra 8 numbers (481-488). Each full block gives one 8, so 48. The last partial block (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100 numbers. Each block has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many full blocks of 100 are there? 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the partial block from 401-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. Wait, but from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 40, plus 440-449, which is 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 4's. Let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. \n\nSo, the calculations seem correct. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48, plus 484 adds 1, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries (1-400) contribute 40, plus 440-449 adds 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** Pages 400-488 contribute 89.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48, plus 488 adds 1, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 full centuries (1-400) contribute 40, plus 480-488 adds 9, totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No pages contribute.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each of these ranges and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering one-digit page numbers. These are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (on page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (on page 8). So, for one-digit numbers, the count is 4:1 and 8:1.\n\nNext, let's look at the two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I need to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 1 through 9. So, for the tens place being 4, the numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 14, 24, ..., 94). Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), that would be 9 times for 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each set (18, 28, ..., 98), so that's also 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, for each digit (4 and 8), in the units place, it's 9 times each. So, for two-digit numbers, the total count for 4 is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, for 8, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. When the tens digit is 4, from 40-49, that's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, for each ten, like 14, 24,...,94, that's 9 times because from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades. So, 9 times in the units place. So, 10 + 9 = 19 for 4 in two-digit numbers. Same for 8: 10 in the tens place (80-89) and 9 in the units place (18,28,...,98), totaling 19.\n\nWait, but hold on, 10 to 99 is 90 numbers, so 9 decades. So, for units digits, yes, 9 times each for 4 and 8. So, two-digit numbers contribute 19 each for 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's note that the three-digit numbers go from 100 to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens and units digits are limited up to 88 (since 488 is the last page).\n\nI think I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately for three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers.\n\nNext, the tens place: For three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9, except when the hundreds digit is 4, the tens digit can only go up to 8 because the book ends at 488.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, the tens digit can be 0-9, but for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, I need to handle the tens place for hundreds digits 1-3 and 4 separately.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, the same applies: for hundreds digits 1-3, units can be 0-9, but for hundreds digit 4, units can be 0-8, except for when the tens digit is 8, the units can only go up to 8 as well.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to split the three-digit numbers into two parts: 100-399 and 400-488. Let me do that.\n\nFirst, for 100-399:\n\n- Hundreds digit: 1, 2, 3\n- Tens digit: 0-9\n- Units digit: 0-9\n\nNow, for each place:\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears only when the hundreds digit is 4, but in 100-399, the hundreds digit is 1,2,3, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, 4's count in hundreds place is 0 here.\n\nTens place: For each hundreds digit (1,2,3), the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the digit 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (40-49 in each hundred). So, for each hundred, 10 times, and there are 3 hundreds, so 3*10=30 times for 4 in the tens place. Similarly, for 8 in the tens place, it's also 10 times per hundred, so 3*10=30 times.\n\nUnits place: Similarly, for each hundreds group, each units digit from 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, 4 appears 10 times per hundred in the units place, and there are 3 hundreds, so 3*10=30 times. Same for 8: 3*10=30 times.\n\nSo, in 100-399, for 4's: tens place 30, units place 30, total 60. For 8's: tens place 30, units place 30, total 60.\n\nNow, moving on to 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds digit: 4\n- Tens digit: 0-8 (since 488 is the last page)\n- Units digit: 0-9, except when tens digit is 8, units go up to 8.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 400 to 488, the tens digit can be 0-8. For each tens digit, the units digit can be 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where the units digit can only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for tens digits 0-7, units digits are 0-9, which is 10 numbers each. For tens digit 8, units digits are 0-8, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total numbers from 400-488: 89 (as calculated earlier).\n\nNow, let's count the 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488).\n\nTens place: For 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's when the tens digit is 4, so that's 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? It's when the tens digit is 8, which is 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nNow, units place: For 400-488, the units digit can be 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it's 0-8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 units digits, including 4 and 8. So, for each of these 8 tens digits (0-7), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and 8 appears once. So, for 4: 8 times (from tens digits 0-7) times 1 (units digit 4) = 8 times. Similarly, for 8: 8 times (tens digits 0-7) times 1 (units digit 8) = 8 times.\n\nNow, for tens digit 8, units digits go from 0-8. So, in this case, the units digit 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, for 4: 1 time, and for 8: 1 time.\n\nTherefore, total units place counts:\n\n- 4's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n- 8's: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For each tens digit from 0-7, units digits 0-9 include 4 and 8 once each, so that's 8 tens digits \u00d7 1 occurrence each = 8 for 4 and 8. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits 0-8 include 4 and 8 once each, so that's 2 more: 4 and 8. So, total units place for 4: 8 + 1 = 9, and for 8: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each tens digit from 0-7, units digits 0-9 include 4 and 8 once each. So, 8 times 4's and 8 times 8's. Then, for tens digit 8, units digits 0-8 include 4 and 8 once each, so that's 1 more 4 and 1 more 8. So, total units place: 4's = 8 + 1 = 9, and 8's = 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, in the units place for 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the 4's and 8's in 400-488:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n- Units place: 4 appears 9 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in 400-488: 89 (hundreds) + 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 108 times.\nTotal 8's in 400-488: 0 (hundreds) + 9 (tens) + 9 (units) = 18 times.\n\nNow, let's combine all the three-digit numbers:\n\nFrom 100-399:\n- 4's: 60\n- 8's: 60\n\nFrom 400-488:\n- 4's: 108\n- 8's: 18\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 60 + 108 = 168\n- 8's: 60 + 18 = 78\n\nNow, let's add up all the page numbers:\n\nOne-digit (1-9):\n- 4's:1\n- 8's:1\n\nTwo-digit (10-99):\n- 4's:19\n- 8's:19\n\nThree-digit (100-488):\n- 4's:168\n- 8's:78\n\nTotal 4's:1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's:1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, but let me check that addition again.\n\nFor 4's:\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's printed:188\nTotal 8's printed:98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nLet me double-check the three-digit numbers:\n\nFrom 100-399:\n- 4's: tens place 30, units place 30, total 60\n- 8's: tens place 30, units place 30, total 60\n\nFrom 400-488:\n- 4's: hundreds 89, tens 10, units 9, total 108\n- 8's: tens 9, units 9, total 18\n\nSo, 60 + 108 = 168 for 4's\n60 + 18 = 78 for 8's\n\nThen, adding one-digit and two-digit:\n\nOne-digit: 1 each\nTwo-digit:19 each\n\nSo, total 4's:1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's:1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference:188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI remember that to find the number of times a specific digit appears, like 4 or 8, I need to look at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. So, maybe I should calculate how many times 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then find the difference.\n\nLet me start by calculating the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. But wait, the last group goes up to 488, which is 488, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So actually, the number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each hundred. So, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? From 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of these 100s, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So for each hundred, that's 10 times, and there are 4 hundreds, so 4*10=40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears once in this range, specifically from 401-410, but wait, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, right? Wait, no, 401-410: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410? Wait, no, 401 is 4 0 1, so the tens digit is 0. Then 410 is 4 1 0. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the places. Let me think again. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for numbers 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in each hundred, but in the last partial hundred, does 4 appear in the tens place? Let me check. From 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last number is 488, so 441-450 is entirely within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 times. So, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so 50 times. Wait, but wait, the last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. But the tens digit in 401-488 goes up to 8, so 4 appears in the tens place for 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, the tens place gives 50 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check: 400 to 488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 in all of them. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check that again. Units place: 48, tens place: 50, hundreds place: 89. So, 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the last group is 481-490, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the units place, how many 8's? Each group of 10 has one 8, so 48 groups would give 48 8's, but wait, the last group is incomplete. Let me check: from 1 to 480, that's 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 8's. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so there's one more 8 in 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit from 0 to 9 appearing 10 times in each hundred. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? From 1 to 488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only in 480-489, but we stop at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, 481 is 4 8 1, up to 488, which is 4 8 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers from 480-488. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait, let me check again. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, so 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 187, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units digit? Each 10 numbers contribute one 4, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. But wait, does 488 include a 4 in the units place? 488 is 4 8 8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, yes, 48 is correct.\n\nTens place: From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, total 50. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. So, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: From 1 to 488, each 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place, so 48 complete groups give 48 8's. Then, in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488), so total 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. So, 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, total 50. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check if I missed any 8's in the hundreds place. Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (each 10 numbers contribute one 4, 488 / 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (4 hundreds \u00d7 10 each = 40, plus 10 in 441-450).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 from 1-480, plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (4 hundreds \u00d7 10 each = 40, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the numbers cycle every 10 pages. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go from 1 to 0. In each set of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once (like 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once (like 8, 18, 28, etc.). \n\nSo, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then an extra 8 pages. In each of those 48 sets, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, 8 appears 48 times in the units place. Now, for the extra 8 pages (from 481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial set, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. \n\nSo, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. \n\nBut wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so from 401 to 488. Let me check if the tens digit 4 and 8 are present here. The tens digit in 401-409 is 0, then 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, 480-488 is 8. So, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 numbers) and 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, from 400-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nBut wait, earlier I considered each hundred contributing 10 times, but in the 400-488 range, which is only 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears once as a full set (440-449) and 8 appears only partially (480-488). So, let me correct that. For the hundreds beyond 100, each hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place, but in the last partial hundred, we have to check how many times each digit appears.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the tens digit separately. Let's see. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. So, in 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, each contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, for 4, that's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Similarly, for 8, it's 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40 times. But wait, 400-488 is only 88 pages, so the tens digit in 400-488 goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 (from 1-400) plus 10 (from 440-449 in 400-488) = 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, no, that's incorrect because I've already included 400-488 in the 4 hundreds. Wait, no, the 4 hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. So, each of those contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, up to 400, 4 appears 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 40 times. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times. That's a difference of 1 in favor of 4.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. Therefore, total in tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. So, yes, 50 vs 49, so 4 has 1 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) has a hundreds digit of 1, 2, 3, or 4 respectively.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. That's a difference of 89 in favor of 4.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49\n- 8: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4: 50\n- 8: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nTotal for 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal for 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 188 - 98 = 90, but I think I made a mistake in the tens place. Let me check again.\n\nWait, earlier I thought in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. But let me recalculate:\n\nFrom 1-400:\n- 4 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n- 8 appears 40 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n- 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n- 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total in tens place:\n- 4: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8: 40 + 9 = 49\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4: 49\n- 8: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4: 89\n- 8: 0\n\nSo, total for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, but 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) is 188. For 8, 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place.\n- The number of complete decades (sets of 10) in 488 is 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n- Each complete decade contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- So, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 for both 4 and 8.\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8.\n- In these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8.\n\nTens place:\n- Each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the tens place every 100 pages.\n- The number of complete centuries (sets of 100) in 488 is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400).\n- Each century contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- So, 4 centuries \u00d7 10 = 40 for both 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n- Now, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-8.\n- In this range, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages.\n- The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n- So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n- The hundreds digit is only present from 100-488.\n- The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- For 4, it's from 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n- So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n- So, hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or another counting method.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit place, calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nUnits place:\n- Number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is given by:\n  - Complete groups: (N // 10) * 1\n  - Remainder: max(0, min(d, (N % 10)) - 0) if d <= (N % 10) else 0\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n- For each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n  - complete = N // 10\n  - remainder = N % 10\n  - if d <= remainder: complete + 1\n  - else: complete\n\nSo, for d=4:\n- complete = 488 // 10 = 48\n- remainder = 488 % 10 = 8\n- since 4 <=8, total units = 48 +1 =49\n\nSimilarly for d=8:\n- complete =48\n- remainder=8\n- since 8<=8, total units=48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n- The formula is similar but for the tens place, which cycles every 100.\n- For each digit d in tens place:\n  - complete = (N // 100)\n  - remainder = N % 100\n  - if d < 10:\n    - count = complete * 10\n    - if d <= (remainder // 10):\n      - count += (remainder // 10 +1)\n    - else:\n      - count += (remainder // 10)\n  - else:\n    - count = complete *10\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n- For each digit d in the tens place, the number of times it appears from 1 to N is:\n  - complete = N // 100\n  - remainder = N % 100\n  - if d < 10:\n    - count = complete * 10\n    - if d <= (remainder // 10):\n      - count += (remainder // 10 +1)\n    - else:\n      - count += (remainder // 10)\n  - else:\n    - count = 0\n\nSo, for d=4 in tens place:\n- complete = 488 // 100 =4\n- remainder=488 %100=88\n- since 4 <10:\n  - count=4*10=40\n  - remainder//10=8\n  - since 4<=8, count +=8+1=9 \u2192 total=40+9=49? Wait, that doesn't match earlier count.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way: For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. So, for each complete block of 100, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for N=488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (1-400). So, for each d, the count is 4*10=40.\n\nThen, for the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (400-409) to 8 (480-488). So, for each digit d in 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\n- For d=4: occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times.\n- For d=8: occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, total for d=4 in tens place: 4*10 +10=50\nTotal for d=8 in tens place:4*10 +9=49\n\nThat's consistent with earlier counts.\n\nHundreds place:\n- For d=4, it appears from 400-488, which is 89 times.\n- For d=8, it never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total counts:\n- 4: units(49) + tens(50) + hundreds(89)=188\n- 8: units(49) + tens(49)=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 90 was the answer, but let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, from 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally every 10 pages.\n   - Complete sets of 10: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n   - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete sets of 100: 4 (1-400).\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, every 10 consecutive numbers will have one 4 and one 8. For example, from 1-10, we have 4 and 8. Similarly, from 11-20, we have 14 and 18, and so on. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 sets would contribute 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, looking at the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I'll move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, from 40-49, that's 10 times, and similarly for 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me think about each hundred separately.\n\nFirst hundred (1-100): The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is another 10 times.\n\nSecond hundred (101-200): The tens digit is 4 in 140-149, which is another 10 times. Similarly, 8 in 180-189, another 10 times.\n\nThird hundred (201-300): Tens digit 4 in 240-249, 10 times. Tens digit 8 in 280-289, 10 times.\n\nFourth hundred (301-400): Tens digit 4 in 340-349, 10 times. Tens digit 8 in 380-389, 10 times.\n\nNow, the fifth hundred would be 401-500, but since the book only goes up to 488, we don't have a complete hundred here. So, in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 times for 4. However, for the tens digit 8, in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so only 480-488. That's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400s.\n\nSo, adding up the tens digits:\n\nFor 4's: Each hundred from 1-400 has 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 hundreds times 10, which is 40. Then, in 401-488, we have another 10 4's in the tens place (440-449). So, total 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor 8's: Similarly, each hundred from 1-300 has 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 3 hundreds times 10 = 30. Then, in 401-488, we have 9 8's in the tens place (480-488). So, total 30 + 9 = 39 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me recount. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place: 1-100 (80-89), 101-200 (180-189), 201-300 (280-289), 301-400 (380-389). So that's 4 sets of 10, totaling 40. But in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, because from 1-400, the hundreds are 1, 2, 3, 4, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 times, so total 8's in tens place is 40 + 9 = 49. So, earlier I thought it was 39, which was wrong. So, total 8's in tens place is 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in tens place, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's: 50, 8's: 49. So, 50 - 49 = 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0. So, 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's add up all the digits.\n\nFirst, units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49, difference 0.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49, difference +1.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0, difference +89.\n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Let me recount each place separately.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For each 10 pages, one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\n- Total complete tens: 48 (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), so 48 sets, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8.\n\n- So, 48 4's and 48 8's.\n\n- Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488): units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\n- So, total units 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Total units 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n- Difference: 0.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9, each appearing 10 times.\n\n- From 1-100: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\n- Similarly, 101-200: 140-149 (10 times 4), 180-189 (10 times 8).\n\n- 201-300: 240-249 (10 times 4), 280-289 (10 times 8).\n\n- 301-400: 340-349 (10 times 4), 380-389 (10 times 8).\n\n- Now, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times), and 8 in 480-488 (9 times).\n\n- So, total 4's in tens place: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, totaling 50.\n\n- Total 8's in tens place: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, totaling 49.\n\n- Difference: 50 - 49 = +1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\n- 800-899: not present, so 0.\n\n- Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 10 vs. 9, so 50 vs. 49.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nSo, total more 4's than 8's is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? Because in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 doesn't appear at all, so that's a difference of 89. Then, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8, so total difference is 89 +1 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 consecutive numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 49, Total 8's: 49. Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, totaling 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 50, Total 8's: 49. Difference: +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89, Total 8's: 0. Difference: +89.\n\nAdding the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll do this for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, I can calculate how many such blocks there are. Since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, that means there are 48 full blocks and then an extra 8 numbers. In each block, there's one 4, so 48 times. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many such blocks are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). In each of the first four blocks, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding all these up for the digit 4: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the units place, I had 48 full decades and then one more in 484, so 49. For the tens place, 4 full centuries with 10 each, so 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50. For the hundreds place, from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to 4, every block of 10 numbers has one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Plus, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers in each block of 100. So, in 1-100, it's 80-89, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 101-200, 180-189, another 10, and so on. How many full hundreds do we have? 4 full centuries (1-400). So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, that's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 40 (from full centuries) plus 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, but actually, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the last partial block. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up for the digit 8: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 times.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place. From 1-400, each century contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 centuries would give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (each contributing one 4) plus one more in 484, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full centuries (each contributing 10 4's) plus 10 in 440-449, so 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89 numbers from 400-488, so 89.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades plus one at 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full centuries contributing 10 each (40) plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned about the hundreds place for 4. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of those has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. That seems right.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 from the four centuries (1-400) and 10 from 440-449, making 50.\n\nUnits place: 48 full decades (1-480) and then 484, so 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 48 full decades (1-480) and then 488, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full centuries (1-400) contributing 10 each, so 40, plus 9 in 480-488, making 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting '4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full decades + 1 in 484).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (40 from four centuries + 10 from 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting '8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full decades + 1 at 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 from four centuries + 9 from 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\n**1. Units Place:**\n\nFirst, let's count how many times 4 appears in the units place. For every group of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, only page 4 has a 4 in the units place. Similarly, from 11-20, only page 14 has a 4 in the units place, and so on.\n\nSince the book has 488 pages, the number of complete groups of ten is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups). Each of these 48 groups contributes one 4 in the units place. So, that's 48 times. But wait, after page 480, we have pages 481 to 488, which is another 8 pages. In these, the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so the next 4 would be at page 484. So, that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's in the units place. Using the same logic, each group of ten has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 groups give 48 eights. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, so for the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times each. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\n**2. Tens Place:**\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit is 4 or 8 when the page number falls within a specific range. For example, numbers from 40-49 have a 4 in the tens place, and numbers from 80-89 have an 8 in the tens place.\n\nFirst, counting 4's in the tens place. The range is 40-49. How many numbers are there? From 40 to 49, that's 10 numbers. So, each of these contributes a 4 in the tens place. But wait, the book goes up to 488, so we need to check if 40-49 are all included. Yes, 40 is page 40, and 49 is page 49, both well within 488. So, that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the range is 80-89. That's another 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on, in the hundreds place, we have page numbers from 100 onwards. So, for the tens place, do we have any 4's or 8's beyond the first two digits? Let me think. For example, in the hundreds place, numbers like 140-149 would have a 4 in the tens place, right? Similarly, 180-189 would have an 8 in the tens place. So, I think I need to account for these as well.\n\nWait, I might have made a mistake earlier by only considering the first two digits. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, for the tens place, the digit can be 4 or 8 in any hundred. So, for each hundred block (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 100 pages. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (40-49) and 8 for another 10 pages (80-89). So, for each hundred, we have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's from the tens place in the first 400 pages.\n\nNow, we have pages 401-488 left. Let's check how many 4's and 8's are in the tens place here. \n\nIn 401-488, the tens digit can be 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's see:\n\n- For 4's in the tens place: The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. That's 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 would be pages 440 to 449, which are all within 488. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\n- For 8's in the tens place: The tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages here, contributing 9 8's.\n\nSo, adding these to our previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from first 400 pages) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from first 400 pages) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, in the tens place, we have 50 4's and 49 8's, giving a difference of 1 more 4 than 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, from 401-488, 440-449 adds 10 4's, and 480-488 adds 9 8's. So, yes, that's correct.\n\n**3. Hundreds Place:**\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, let's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages. The number of pages here is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit can only be 8 if the page number is 800 or above. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, the hundreds place contributes 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**4. Total Count:**\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each digit position.\n\n- Units place: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n- Tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nAdding them up:\n\nTotal 4's = 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's = 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems quite high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- For 4's: Each group of ten has one 4 in the units place. From 1-480, that's 48 groups, so 48 4's. Then, pages 481-488 include page 484, which is another 4. So, total 49 4's. That seems correct.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, each group of ten has one 8 in the units place. From 1-480, 48 groups, so 48 8's. Then, page 488 adds another 8. So, 49 8's. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: Each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 adds another 10. So, 50 total. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, 480-488 adds 9. So, 49 total. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\n- 8's: None, since the book doesn't reach 800. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. But let me think again. Is there a way to cross-verify this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the difference is 90.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's count the number of 4's in each position again.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4. So, 48 4's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), we have 484, which is another 4. So, total 49 4's in units place.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, 4 hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10. So, total 50 4's in tens place.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Similarly, 48 full tens contribute 48 8's. Then, page 488 adds one more, so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- None, as before.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count 4's and 8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each group of ten numbers contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - From 1-480: 48 groups \u2192 48 each.\n   - Pages 481-488: 484 adds one more 4; 488 adds one more 8.\n   - Total: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Count 4's and 8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 hundreds \u2192 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - 440-449 adds 10 4's.\n     - 480-488 adds 9 8's.\n   - Total: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Count 4's and 8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 4's.\n   - No 8's as the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - Total: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n4. **Calculate Totals and Difference:**\n   - Total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - Total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I need to do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in all the page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the answer. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once in every block of 10 numbers.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place, so for 48 blocks, that's 48 times. Similarly, 8 appears once per block, so also 48 times. \n\nNow, the extra 8 numbers from 481 to 488: let's list them out. 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Looking at the units digits here, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total units place 4's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (extra) = 49.\nTotal units place 8's: 48 (from blocks) + 1 (extra) = 49.\n\nSo, so far, the units place contributes equally to both 4's and 8's. Now, moving on to the tens place.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place each hundred, and same for 8. So, for 4 hundreds, 4's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40. Similarly, 8's in tens place: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; and so on up to 481-488, where the tens digit is 8. \n\nWait, but actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). \n\nWait, but each of these tens digits only appears a certain number of times. Let me see: 401-410 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 0 appears 10 times. Similarly, 411-420 is 10, so tens digit 1 appears 10 times, and so on. But wait, 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in the extra 88 pages:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0, 10 times\n- 411-420: tens digit 1, 10 times\n- 421-430: tens digit 2, 10 times\n- 431-440: tens digit 3, 10 times\n- 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 times\n- 451-460: tens digit 5, 10 times\n- 461-470: tens digit 6, 10 times\n- 471-480: tens digit 7, 10 times\n- 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 times\n\nSo, in the tens place in the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from extra) = 50.\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from extra) = 48.\n\nSo, so far, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case, since the book goes up to 488.\n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears 100 times each, except for the last one, which might be less.\n\nWait, let me think. From 1-99, there's no hundreds digit, so hundreds digit is 0. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so 100 times. Similarly, 200-299: 100 times 2, 300-399: 100 times 3, and 400-488: 89 times 4 (since 488 is 488-400+1 = 89 numbers).\n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? 89 times.\n\nHow about 8? Well, in the hundreds place, 8 would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total hundreds place 4's: 89\nTotal hundreds place 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 = 97\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations again because 49+48=97, but 4's are 188, so 188-97=91 more 4's than 8's. But I feel like that might be too high. Let me go through each part again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-480, there are 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So units place 4's: 48+1=49, 8's: 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-400, there are 4 complete hundreds. Each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so 4's: 4*10=40, 8's: 4*10=40.\n\nThen, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the last group (481-488) is only 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times instead of 10. So, in the extra 88 pages:\n\n- Tens digit 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- Tens digit 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\nTotal tens place 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and there are 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nSo, 188 - 97 = 91 more 4's than 8's. Hmm, that seems correct, but let me just cross-verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each digit place separately and count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nWait, another approach: for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.) and similarly 10 where it's 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 400 pages, 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both.\n\nBut from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0\n- 411-420: tens digit 1\n- 421-430: tens digit 2\n- 431-440: tens digit 3\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5\n- 461-470: tens digit 6\n- 471-480: tens digit 7\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, total tens place 4's: 40 +10=50, 8's: 40 +8=48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's or 8's.\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 4 appears 89 times (488-400+1=89). 8 never appears in the hundreds place here.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\nAdding up all the 8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nSo, 188-97=91. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to calculate this? Maybe using a formula or something. I remember that for each digit place, the number of times a digit appears can be calculated using a formula, especially for numbers up to n.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to just stick with the method I used, since it's a bit time-consuming but thorough.\n\nWait, another thought: when I was counting the units place, I considered 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8. But actually, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which is 48 blocks of 10. Then, from 481-488, that's 8 numbers, as I did before.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, from 1-400, that's 400 numbers, which is 4 blocks of 100, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 numbers, the tens digits go up to 8, but only 8 numbers in the last group.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? It's 10 times in 441-450, right? Because 441-450 is 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Similarly, 481-488 is 8 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n- Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (1-480).\n- 4 and 8 each appear 48 times in the units place.\n- Last 8 numbers (481-488): 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n- Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- 4's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n- 8's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n- Extra 88 pages (401-488):\n  - Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450).\n  - Tens digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n- Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89.\n- Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense because each digit's occurrence can be counted separately based on their position.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, the digit 4 appears once in each set of ten, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll consider 48 full sets and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, but wait, that's not quite right because the last set isn't complete. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated by the number of complete decades (sets of ten) plus any extra in the incomplete set. So, for the units digit, the number of 4's would be the number of times 4 appears in the units place from 1 to 488. Similarly for 8's.\n\nSo, for each digit, the count in the units place is floor(488 / 10) + 1 if the digit is less than or equal to the remaining pages. Wait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. For the units digit:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is equal to (N // 10) + (1 if d <= (N % 10) else 0). But wait, actually, for each digit d, the count is (N // 10) + (1 if d <= (N % 10) else 0). But wait, that's only if d is from 0 to 9. But in our case, we're looking for digits 4 and 8.\n\nWait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first page is 1, not 0. So, for units digit, from 1 to 488, the number of times 4 appears is how many times 4 is in the units place. So, for each ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many such tens are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480). So, 4 appears 48 times in the units place from 1-480. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total units digit 4's: 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: in each ten numbers, 8 appears once. So, 48 times from 1-480. Then, from 481-488, 8 appears once (488). So total units digit 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times. So, the difference here is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit is the second digit from the right. So, for example, in 1-9, the tens digit is 0, but since we're only considering page numbers starting from 1, maybe we can ignore the leading zero. Wait, but in terms of counting digits, the tens digit for numbers 1-9 is zero, but since we're only printing page numbers, the leading zero isn't printed. So, perhaps we should consider numbers as three-digit numbers with leading zeros for the purpose of counting digits, but I think that's complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of each number as a three-digit number, padding with leading zeros where necessary, so that each number from 001 to 488 is considered as three digits. Then, we can count the digits in each position separately. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think without leading zeros. So, for numbers 1-9, they are single-digit, so tens and hundreds digits don't exist. For 10-99, they are two-digit, so the tens digit is present, and for 100-488, they are three-digit, so hundreds digit is present.\n\nSo, for the tens place, let's consider how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears a certain number of times. For example, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 1-99, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) and then 1-9 for 10-99. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digits go from 0-9 again, and so on.\n\nSo, for the tens digit:\n\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, determine how many complete hundreds are there in N. For 488, that's 4 (since 4*100=400, and 5*100=500 which is beyond 488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 10 times for each digit 0-9. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, etc., up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for each hundred.\n\nSo, for 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-400). So, for each digit d in the tens place, it appears 4*10=40 times. But wait, 400 is the end of the fourth hundred, so from 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, we have another 88 numbers. So, the tens digits in 401-488 go from 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). So, each tens digit from 0-8 appears once in this range, except that 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears once, but only for 8 numbers, so how does that affect the count?\n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) which is 10 numbers, but wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 0 for 10 numbers. Then 411-420 is tens digit 1, 10 numbers, and so on up to 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, not 10. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. Wait, no, that's not correct because 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10.\n\nWait, but from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit d from 0 to 8, the number of times it appears is 10 times except for d=8, which appears 8 times. So, for each d from 0-7, it's 10 times, and d=8 is 8 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (as tens digit in 440-449), but wait, no. Wait, 440-449 is part of the 400s, so the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens digit counts:\n\n- For 4: in 1-400, it's 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, it's another 10 times (from 440-449). So total 40+10=50 times.\n\n- For 8: in 1-400, it's 4*10=40 times. Then, in 401-488, it's 8 times (from 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers? Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's clarify. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, for each tens digit d, the number of times it appears is 10, except for d=8, which is only 8 times because 481-488 is 8 numbers. Wait, but 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in 480-488. Wait, but 480 is part of the 401-488 range, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times because 481-488 is 8 numbers, but 480 is also part of the 401-488 range, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. So, I think I made a mistake earlier, it's 9 times, not 8.\n\nSo, correcting that, in the tens place, from 401-488, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, total tens digit counts:\n\n- For 4: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times.\n\n- For 8: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is the third digit from the right. In this case, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (for 100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488).\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place:\n\n- 4: 89 times.\n\n- 8: 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up the counts for each digit in all positions.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For 4's: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48 times, plus 484 in 481-488, so 49 times. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: 48 full tens gives 48 times, plus 488 in 481-488, so 49 times. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4's: 4 hundreds (1-400) gives 4*10=40 times, plus 440-449 (10 times), total 50. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: 4 hundreds give 40 times, plus 480-488 (9 times), total 49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488). Correct.\n\n- 8 doesn't appear. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers is 188, and the digit 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, but since the book only goes up to 488, I need to check how many complete blocks of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial block. \n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks). In each block, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. But wait, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once at 484. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, no, that's not right. Because 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4's in the units place would be from 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Let me calculate that correctly. \n\nThe units digit cycles every 10 numbers, so from 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 blocks of 10. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in blocks of 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. \n\nLet me count how many such blocks there are up to 488. The blocks are 40-49 (10 numbers), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's valid. So total tens place 4's: 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? \n\nFrom 1 to 480, that's 48 blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, from 481 to 488, we have 8 more numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Here, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks of 100, specifically 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers (480-488). \n\nEach block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 contributes 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. That's four blocks, each with 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. In these, the tens digit is 8 for all, so that's 9 more. So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check. For the tens place, I considered blocks like 80-89, which is correct, each contributing 10 8's. Then 180-189, etc., up to 380-389, which is four blocks, each with 10, so 40. Then, 480-488: since 480 is the start, and 488 is the end, that's 9 numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14,...,484. From 1 to 488, how many numbers ending with 4? The first is 4, then every 10 numbers. So, the last one is 484, which is 4 + (n-1)*10 = 484. Solving for n: (484 - 4)/10 + 1 = 480/10 +1 = 48 +1=49. So yes, 49 units place 4's.\n\nTens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488: 89 numbers, each with 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor the 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18,...,488. From 8 to 488, step 10. The last one is 488, which is 8 + (n-1)*10 = 488. So (488 -8)/10 +1=480/10 +1=48+1=49. Correct.\n\nTens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10, and the last block contributes 9, so 4*10 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as before.\n\nSo total 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nSo, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. But wait, since the book ends at 488, I need to check how many full tens there are and then see if there's a partial set at the end.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. The number of complete tens is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). So, in each of these 48 tens, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, the 49th ten would be 481-490, but our book ends at 488, so the units digit 4 in 484 is included. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, actually, the units digit 4 appears 48 times? Or is it 49 times?\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, we have 484, which is another 4 in the units place. So that's 48 + 1 = 49 times for the units place.\n\nWait, but 480 is included, so 480 is 4 in the hundreds place, 8 in the tens, and 0 in the units. So, in the units place, from 1-488, how many 4's are there? Let me calculate it differently. The number of times a digit appears in the units place can be calculated as the number of complete groups of ten and then any remaining numbers.\n\nThe formula is: For a given digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor((N)/10) if the digit is not zero, plus one if the last partial group includes the digit.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of it as the number of complete tens multiplied by 1 (since each ten has one 4 in the units place) plus the number of 4's in the units place in the partial group if N is not a multiple of ten.\n\nSo, for 488, the number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480). So, 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), how many 4's are in the units place? Looking at 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but actually, 480 is included in the 48 complete tens, so 480 is part of the 48th ten, which is 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers. So, in the units place, from 480-488, the digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484). Therefore, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4.\n\nSo, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), 4 (400-488). So, the blocks are:\n\n- 40-49: 10 numbers\n- 140-149: 10 numbers\n- 240-249: 10 numbers\n- 340-349: 10 numbers\n- 440-449: 10 numbers\n\nWait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 40-49: yes, 10 numbers. Similarly, each subsequent block adds another 10. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, each number from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. How many times does 8 appear in the units place from 1-488?\n\nUsing the same method: number of complete tens is 48 (since 48*10=480). Each complete ten contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488.\n\nEach block from 80-89, 180-189, etc., has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: here, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8, so 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, does that affect the count?\n\nWait, in the tens place, for 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 numbers. So, each of the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contribute 10 each, and the last block (480-488) contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. For example, 80-89: 10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place. Similarly for 180-189, etc., up to 380-389. Then 480-488: 9 numbers. So, yes, 4*10 +9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. So, from 80-89: 10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. That's 4*10 +9=49. So, yes, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the 4's in the tens place, I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\nUnits place: 49.\n\nSo, 89+50+49=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that in the hundreds place for 4's, I might have miscounted? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 5 blocks each with 10 numbers, so 50.\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nYes, 188 seems right.\n\nFor 8's, units:49, tens:49, so 98.\n\nDifference:90.\n\nWait, but I just thought, in the tens place for 8's, in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8, but the hundreds digit is 4. So, the number 488 has both 4 in hundreds and 8 in tens and units. So, does that affect the count? No, because we're counting each digit separately. So, 488 contributes one 8 in the tens place and one 8 in the units place. So, that's already included in the counts.\n\nWait, but in the 480-488 range, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers, so that's 9 times, which we added to the tens place count. Similarly, the units digit 8 appears once in 488, which is included in the units count.\n\nSo, I think the counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nI guess the approach here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the total counts for 4's and 8's, I can subtract the two to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 times. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the pages from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so that's 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. Wait, but actually, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 instances. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included, making it 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers? 488 - 400 = 88, so plus 1 is 89. Yes, that's correct. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place is 48, tens place is 50, and hundreds place is 89. So, total 4's = 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in every group of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, how many groups of 10 are there? 48 full groups (1-480), and then 8 more numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 groups, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, 80-89 in each hundred. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so it's 480-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here, but wait, each full set of 10 would have 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, no, actually, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total tens place 8's: 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the pages from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, and hundreds place is 0. So, total 8's = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for units place, 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 187, and total 8's are 98. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 187 - 98 = 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by separating the problem into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are pages 1 through 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears once (page 4), and the digit 8 appears once (page 8). So, so far, 4's count is 1 and 8's count is 1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, let's look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a ones place. I think I should count the number of 4's and 8's in both the tens and ones places separately.\n\nFirst, for the tens place in two-digit numbers:\n- The tens digit cycles from 1 to 9. For each tens digit, the ones digit goes from 0 to 9.\n- When the tens digit is 4 (i.e., pages 40-49), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- Similarly, when the tens digit is 8 (i.e., pages 80-89), the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the ones place in two-digit numbers:\n- For each tens group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the ones digit cycles through 0-9.\n- So, in each group, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 94). There are 9 such groups (10-99), so 4 appears 9 times in the ones place.\n- Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each group (18, 28, ..., 98), so 8 appears 9 times in the ones place.\n\nWait, but actually, in the two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers. Each digit place (tens and ones) cycles every 10 numbers. So, for the tens place, each digit from 1-9 appears exactly 10 times. Similarly, for the ones place, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times (since there are 9 groups of 10). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, for the ones place in two-digit numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 9 times because there are 9 tens groups (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99). So, for each digit in the ones place, it's 9 times. So, the digit 4 appears 9 times in the ones place, and similarly, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but when the tens digit is 4, the ones digit can also be 4, so I think I might be double-counting. No, actually, when I count the tens place, I'm considering all the 4's in the tens place, and then separately counting the 4's in the ones place. So, that should be correct.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers:\n- 4's in tens place: 10 times (40-49)\n- 4's in ones place: 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94)\n- Total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nSimilarly,\n- 8's in tens place: 10 times (80-89)\n- 8's in ones place: 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98)\n- Total 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nSo, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, the difference here is 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complicated because we have three digit places: hundreds, tens, and ones. Let me break this down by each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place:\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4. So, 8's count in hundreds place is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9 for each hundreds group. Let's consider each hundreds group separately.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n- The tens digit cycles from 0-9, and for each tens digit, the ones digit cycles from 0-9. So, for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers.\n- The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 140-149, which is 10 times.\n- The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 180-189, which is 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n- 4 in tens place: 240-249 \u2192 10 times\n- 8 in tens place: 280-289 \u2192 10 times\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n- 4 in tens place: 340-349 \u2192 10 times\n- 8 in tens place: 380-389 \u2192 10 times\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- The tens digit goes from 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digits are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.\n- The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times.\n- The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. So, that's 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, the digit 8 in the tens place occurs 9 times here.\n\nSo, for the tens place in three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (from 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40 times\n- 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, so when the tens digit is 8, the ones digits go from 0-8, making 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers. Again, let's go through each hundreds group.\n\nFor hundreds digit 1 (100-199):\n- The ones digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens group (100-109, 110-119, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place (e.g., 104, 114, etc.), and similarly for 8 (108, 118, etc.).\n- There are 10 tens groups (0-9), so 4 appears 10 times in the ones place, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299):\n- 4 appears 10 times in the ones place\n- 8 appears 10 times in the ones place\n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399):\n- 4 appears 10 times in the ones place\n- 8 appears 10 times in the ones place\n\nFor hundreds digit 4 (400-488):\n- The tens digits go from 0-8, as before. For each tens digit, the ones digit goes from 0-9, except when the tens digit is 8, where it goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page).\n- So, for each tens digit from 0-7, the ones digit cycles 0-9, so 4 appears once per tens group, and 8 appears once per tens group.\n- For tens digit 8, the ones digits go from 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nWait, but let me think again. For hundreds digit 4, the page numbers go up to 488, so the ones digit in the last group (tens digit 8) goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for hundreds digit 4, the number of times 4 appears in the ones place:\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 ones digits (0-9), so 4 appears once in each, totaling 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8: ones digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n- So, total 4's in ones place for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 times\n- Similarly, 8's in ones place for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9 times\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct this. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the ones digit goes from 0 to 9, so 4 appears once in each of these 8 tens groups, so 8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, the ones digit goes from 0 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in ones place for hundreds digit 4: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times. Similarly, 8's in ones place: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times.\n\nWait, but actually, for each tens group in hundreds digit 4, except the last one, the ones digit goes up to 9. So, for tens digits 0-7, each has 10 ones digits, so 4 appears once each, so 8 times. For tens digit 8, ones digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). Therefore, total 4's in ones place for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9. Similarly, 8's: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the ones place in three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times\n- 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39 times\n\nWait, but earlier I thought for hundreds digit 4, the ones place 4's were 9, so total 4's in ones place would be 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39, and same for 8's.\n\nNow, let me summarize the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89 times\n  - 8's: 0 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 40 times\n  - 8's: 39 times\n\n- Ones place:\n  - 4's: 39 times\n  - 8's: 39 times\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times\n\nWait, let me add that again:\n- Hundreds: 89\n- Tens: 40\n- Ones: 39\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Hundreds: 0\n- Tens: 39\n- Ones: 39\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let me check if this makes sense. So, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times, and 8's appear 78 times.\n\nNow, let's go back and add up all the occurrences from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nOne-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1 + 19 is 20, plus 168 is 188 for 4's. For 8's, 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's printed is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially for the three-digit numbers because that's where most of the difference comes from.\n\nStarting with three-digit numbers:\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89 (from 400-488)\n- 8's: 0\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-449) = 40\n- 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n\nOnes place:\n- 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39\n- 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\nTotal 8's in three-digit: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding one-digit and two-digit:\n- 4's: 1 + 19 = 20\n- 8's: 1 + 19 = 20\n\nTotal overall:\n- 4's: 20 + 168 = 188\n- 8's: 20 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a big difference. Let me check if I made a mistake in counting the three-digit numbers, especially in the ones place for hundreds digit 4.\n\nIn hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the ones place 4's:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each has 10 ones digits, so 4 appears once in each, so 8 times.\n- For tens digit 8: ones digits go up to 8, so 4 appears once (484).\n- So, total 4's in ones place for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in ones place for hundreds digit 4: 8 + 1 = 9.\n\nSo, 4's in ones place: 9, and 8's in ones place: 9.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4's in ones place: 9, and 8's in ones place: 9.\n\nWait, but when I added earlier, I included 10 for each hundreds group except 400-488, which had 9. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 for 4's in ones place, and same for 8's.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place for hundreds digit 4, the 4's in tens place occur in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8's in tens place occur in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the difference is indeed 90.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider an alternative approach. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me consider each digit place separately: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit, each digit 0-9 cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete cycles of 10 are there?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48 complete cycles, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete cycle (10 numbers), each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 48 complete cycles, each digit appears 48 times.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once, and 9 and 0 do not appear.\n\nSo, total units digit counts:\n\n- For digits 0-9:\n  - 0 appears 48 times (once per cycle, 48 cycles)\n  - 1-8 appear 48 times each (from cycles) + 1 time each from the remaining 8 numbers\n  - 9 appears 48 times\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group. So, in each cycle of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 488 numbers, there are 48 full cycles (48*10=480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n\nSo, for the units digit:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place from the full cycles.\n- Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so each of these digits appears once more.\n\nTherefore:\n- Units digit counts:\n  - 0: 48\n  - 1: 48 + 1 = 49\n  - 2: 48 + 1 = 49\n  - 3: 48 + 1 = 49\n  - 4: 48 + 1 = 49\n  - 5: 48 + 1 = 49\n  - 6: 48 + 1 = 49\n  - 7: 48 + 1 = 49\n  - 8: 48 + 1 = 49\n  - 9: 48\n\nSo, in units place, 4 appears 49 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought in three-digit numbers, 4's in ones place were 39, but according to this, it's 49. Hmm, so where is the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach by separating one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. Maybe this digit-by-digit approach is more accurate.\n\nLet me try this method for all digit places.\n\nFirst, units place:\n- As above, 4 appears 49 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nTens place:\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, in 488 numbers, how many complete hundreds are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more numbers (401-488).\n\nWait, but actually, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, with each digit 0-9 appearing 10 times in each hundred. So, for 488 numbers, there are 4 complete hundreds (each contributing 10 times per digit) and then 88 numbers beyond that.\n\nWait, but 488 is 4*100 + 88, so yes.\n\nBut wait, in reality, each hundred contributes 10 times per digit in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit 0-9 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 numbers (401-488) have tens digits from 0-8 (since 488 is the last number). Let's see:\n\n- From 401-409: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 410-419: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 420-429: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 430-439: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 440-449: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 450-459: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 460-469: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 470-479: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 480-488: tens digit 8 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digits are:\n- 0: 10 times\n- 1: 10 times\n- 2: 10 times\n- 3: 10 times\n- 4: 10 times\n- 5: 10 times\n- 6: 10 times\n- 7: 10 times\n- 8: 9 times\n\nSo, for the tens place in the remaining 88 numbers:\n- 4 appears 10 times\n- 8 appears 9 times\n\nTherefore, total tens place counts:\n- 4's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from remaining) = 50\n- 8's: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 9 (from remaining) = 49\n\nWait, but this contradicts my earlier approach where in the three-digit numbers, I had 40 4's and 39 8's in the tens place. Hmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach by not considering that in the hundreds digit 4, the tens digit goes up to 8, but in reality, the tens digit in the remaining 88 numbers includes 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times, and 80-88, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, according to this, in the tens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nSimilarly, for the units place, we have 49 each.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nThe hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, which are from 100-488.\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 100-199 \u2192 100 numbers\n- Hundreds digit 2: 200-299 \u2192 100 numbers\n- Hundreds digit 3: 300-399 \u2192 100 numbers\n- Hundreds digit 4: 400-488 \u2192 89 numbers\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place\n\nSo, total hundreds place counts:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nNow, adding up all digit places:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 49\n- 8's: 49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, so both methods give me the same result, 90. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I was calculating the three-digit numbers separately, I had 4's in three-digit numbers as 168 and 8's as 78, which when added to one-digit and two-digit counts gave the same totals.\n\nYes, because in the three-digit numbers, 4's were 168, and 8's were 78. Then, adding one-digit (1) and two-digit (19) gave 1 + 19 = 20 for 4's, and 1 + 19 = 20 for 8's. So, 20 + 168 = 188, and 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, both methods agree.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place calculation. Because in the first approach, I thought that in the tens place for three-digit numbers, 4's were 40 and 8's were 39, but according to the digit-by-digit approach, it's 50 and 49. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Wait, no, actually, in the three-digit numbers, the tens place counts were:\n\n- 4's: 40\n- 8's: 39\n\nBut in the digit-by-digit approach, the total tens place counts for 4's were 50 and 8's were 49, which includes all page numbers, not just three-digit. So, perhaps I need to reconcile these.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, the tens place counts were 40 for 4's and 39 for 8's. Then, in the digit-by-digit approach, the total tens place counts are 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's. The difference is because the digit-by-digit approach includes all page numbers, including one-digit and two-digit.\n\nWait, no, because in the three-digit approach, I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, but in the digit-by-digit approach, I considered all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust. Let me think.\n\nIn the three-digit approach, when I calculated the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 40 4's and 39 8's. But in the digit-by-digit approach, the total tens place counts for all page numbers are 50 4's and 49 8's. So, the difference must be in the two-digit and one-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the three-digit approach, I had:\n\n- One-digit: 0 4's and 0 8's in tens place (since one-digit numbers don't have a tens digit)\n- Two-digit: 19 4's and 19 8's in tens and ones places, but wait, no, in the three-digit approach, I separated the counts for tens and ones places in two-digit numbers as well.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the digit-by-digit approach, which seems more accurate, as it systematically counts each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Units place: 49 4's, 49 8's\n- Tens place: 50 4's, 49 8's\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Breakdown by Digit Places:**\n   - Consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n2. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 complete cycles of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one more occurrence for digits 1-8.\n   - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n3. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds in 488 pages, contributing 40 occurrences of each digit.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 occurrences for '4' (400-409, etc.) and 9 for '8' (480-488).\n   - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n4. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only present in three-digit numbers (100-488).\n   - '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 occurrences.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n5. **Total Counts:**\n   - **'4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **'8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n6. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.  \n\\boxed{90}"

So, I'll need to calculate how many 4's appear in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place across all page numbers. I'll do the same for the digit 8 and then find the difference between the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nLet's start with the digit 4. I'll go through each place one by one.\n\n1. **Units Place (4's):** The units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, ..., 484). So, for the complete groups, that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\n2. **Tens Place (4's):** The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each group of 100 has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). From 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these groups contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial group (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 401-410. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 401-488: the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 in 401-410, 1 in 411-420, ..., up to 8 in 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 would be from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. But for the tens digit 4, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, that adds another 10. Wait, but 401-410 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 4*10 is 40 from the first 400 pages, and then 10 from 401-410, so that's 50. But wait, 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range, which is 88 pages. So, does that mean that the tens digit cycles through 0-8 in the tens place? So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, yes, the tens digit 4 appears in 401-410, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (4's):** The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's are 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units Place (8's):** Similar to the 4's in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Each group of 10 has one 8 (8, 18, 28, ..., 488). 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8. So, 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place (8's):** The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. From 1 to 488, how many such groups are there? Each hundred has one such group. So, 400-488 includes 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but wait: in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). So, from 1-400, there are 4 sets of 100, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the start, and 488 is the end, so that's 9 numbers. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place (8's):** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 187, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4*10=40. Then from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 4's are from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's there.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last group (481-488), units digit doesn't include 4, so 48 total.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus in the last group (481-488), units digit 8 appears once (488), so 48 +1=49.\n\nYes, that all adds up. So, the difference is indeed 89.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (once every 10 numbers, 488/10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 per hundred, 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus 10 in 401-410).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (pages 400-488).\n\nTotal '4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 full groups plus one in 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 from 1-400, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). In each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48*1 = 48 fours. Now, in the partial block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Here, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for a whole block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40 to 49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers, so in 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 80 more pages (400-488). In each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 40-49). So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 fours. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, that's 10 more. So total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding up the 4's from each place: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once. So, in 48 full blocks, that's 48*1 = 48 eights. The partial block from 481 to 488 has units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. In each hundred, there's one such block. So, in 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? There are 4 full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place, we have 9 eights. Therefore, total eights in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 is from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, yes, 9 eights. So, 40 from the full hundreds plus 9 gives 49 in the tens place. So, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 188 and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place. From 40-49 in each hundred, that's 10 numbers, so 10 fours per hundred. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's another 10, making it 50 in the tens place. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1 four, so 48, plus the partial block from 481-488, which has 484, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: 48 full blocks, 48 eights, plus 488, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 eights, so total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but in the units place, 488 is included, so that's another 8 in the units place, making it 49.\n\nWait, but 488 is 4-8-8, so that's two 8's in that number. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. When I counted the units place for 8's, I considered each block of 10, so from 1-10, 11-20, etc., each contributing one 8 in the units place. But in the last block, from 481-488, the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, 488 has two 8's, one in the tens and one in the units. So, when I counted the tens place, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. But 488 is included in that, so that's correct. Similarly, in the units place, 488 is counted as one 8.\n\nSo, the total 8's are correctly 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again for the 4's in the units place. From 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms are there? The first term is 4, last term is 484. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, etc., each block of 100 contributing 10 fours in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4*10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. So, total 50.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 fours.\n\nFor the 8's, units place: same logic, 49 times.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds contributing 10 each, so 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the 8's tens place. Let me check again. From 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 488 is included, so that's one more 8 in the units place beyond the 48 from the full blocks. So, 49 total.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4'.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488).\n   - Full blocks: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - Partial block: 484 contributes 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has a block (40-49) contributing 10 '4's.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial block (400-488): 440-449 contributes 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '8'.\n   - Full blocks: 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - Partial block (481-488): 488 contributes 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every block of 100 numbers has a block (80-89) contributing 10 '8's.\n   - Full hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial block (400-488): 480-488 contributes 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have '8' in the hundreds place (only up to 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each position in the page numbers separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with the units place: In the single-digit page numbers (1-9), the digit 4 appears once. Then, in the two-digit numbers from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such sets (10-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of 10. So, 9 times 1 equals 9. Adding the single-digit 4, that's 10 so far for the units place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place: Again, looking at two-digit numbers. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For the three-digit numbers, the hundreds place can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, when the hundreds digit is 4, the page numbers go from 400 to 488. But I'm interested in the tens place here. So, in the range 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. From 400-499, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 in the hundreds place (400-488) occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's another 10 in the tens place for three-digit numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 10 (from two-digit) + 10 (from three-digit) = 20.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (10) + tens (20) + hundreds (89) = 119. Wait, let me check that again. Units place: 1 (single-digit) + 9 (two-digit) = 10. Tens place: 10 (two-digit) + 10 (three-digit) = 20. Hundreds place: 89. So, total 4's: 10 + 20 + 89 = 119.\n\nHmm, that seems high. Let me verify. For units place, from 1-9: 1 four. From 10-99: each ten has one 4 in the units place, so 9 tens, 9 fours. So, 1 + 9 = 10. That's correct.\n\nTens place: From 10-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours. From 100-488, the tens digit is 4 in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, that's four sets of 10, so 40 fours. But wait, 140-149: 10 numbers, same for 240-249, etc. So, 4 sets, each contributing 10 fours, so 40. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 10. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no, because when I considered the hundreds place, I was only looking at the hundreds digit being 4, which is from 400-488. But for the tens place in three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 4 regardless of the hundreds digit. So, from 100-399, the tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, each contributing 10 fours. So, that's 3 sets, 30 fours. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 10 (two-digit) + 30 (three-digit, hundreds 1-3) + 10 (three-digit, hundreds 4) = 50. Wait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought it was 20. I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Let's count the number of times 4 appears in each digit place separately, without worrying about the other digits.\n\nFor units place: From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place is total numbers divided by 10, which is 488 / 10 = 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction, it's 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48 fours. But wait, from 1-9, the units digit is 4 once, so that's included in the 48. Wait, but 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which would mean 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then 8 numbers in the last partial ten (481-488), which doesn't include a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\nWait, but when I counted earlier, I thought it was 10. That can't be right. Wait, no, that was for two-digit numbers. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the approaches. Let me clarify.\n\nAnother method: For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many times 4 appears.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEach block of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 in the units place. So, the number of such blocks is 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full blocks, each contributing one 4, and then 8 numbers in the last block (481-488). Since 481-488 doesn't include a 4 in the units place, the total is 48 fours.\n\nWait, but from 1-9, the units digit is 4 once. So, 48 includes that, right? Because 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each with one 4 in the units place, so 48 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\n- The tens digit is 4 in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449.\n\nEach of these blocks has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488?\n\n- The first block is 40-49: 10 numbers.\n- Then 140-149: another 10.\n- 240-249: another 10.\n- 340-349: another 10.\n- 440-449: another 10.\n\nSo that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's valid.\n\nNow, for hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. How many numbers are there here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, that seems high. Earlier, I thought it was 119, but now I'm getting 187. I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the way I was counting earlier. Let me try the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place: Each block of 100 numbers has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, it's 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, it's 140-149: 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours, so 50. That's correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 119. Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering all the blocks correctly. So, 187 is the correct count for 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Similar to 4, each block of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times. So, 48 units place 8's.\n\nTens place:\n\n- The tens digit is 8 in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n\nWait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's see how many full blocks there are.\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page).\n\nSo, the first four blocks contribute 10 each, and the last block contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers.\n- 180-189: 10.\n- 280-289: 10.\n- 380-389: 10.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers).\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 fours in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\n- The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (48) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 97.\n\nWait, let me check that. Units place: 48, tens place: 49, so total 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 187 and 8's were 97, so the difference is 90. But I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me cross-verify the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 48 + 49 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 187 - 97 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 97. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll do this for both 4 and 8 and then compare the totals.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place**: The digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. To find how many times this happens from 1 to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That's 48 times. But wait, the last block might not be complete. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the 49th block is incomplete, from 481 to 488. Since 481 is 48*10 +1, so 481-490 would be the 49th block, but we only go up to 488. So, in the units place, does 488 include another 4? Let's see, 488 is 4-8-8, so the units digit is 8, not 4. So, the last complete block is 471-480, which would have a 4 in the units place at 474. So, 48 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. The next would be 140-149, then 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d710 = 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up for the digit 4: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 +50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. **Units place**: Similar to 4, in every block of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8. The last block is 481-488, which includes 488, so the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, 48 times for the full blocks, plus one more in the last partial block (488). So, 48 +1=49 times in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place**: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, each full block contributes 10 times, and the last block contributes 9 times. How many full blocks are there? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four full blocks, each contributing 10 times. Then the last block is 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total for tens place: 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. So, 49 times in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place**: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding these up for the digit 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98. So, 98 times the digit 8 appears.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 -98=89.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449). Each has 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers.\nTotal: 48+50+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48, plus 488 contributes 1 more, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so 4\u00d710=40. Then 480-488 contributes 9 (480-488). So total tens: 40+9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49+49=98.\n\nDifference: 187-98=89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the digit 4:**\n- **Units place:** 48 occurrences (one in each block of 10, up to 480).\n- **Tens place:** 50 occurrences (10 per block for 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences (400-488).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting the digit 8:**\n- **Units place:** 49 occurrences (48 in blocks 1-480, plus 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 occurrences (40 in blocks 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I need to do is count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then a partial set from 481 to 488. \n\nIn each full set of ten, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once in the units place here as well (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, in 40-49, every number has a 4 in the tens place. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? \n\nFrom 1-99, there's one block: 40-49. From 100-199, another block: 140-149. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, that's five blocks in total, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, so 5*10=50. \n\nBut wait, 440-449 is from page 440 to 449, which is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only when the page numbers are from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through each place again: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1-488, there are 48 full sets of ten (since 488 /10 = 48.8) and a partial set from 481-488. \n\nEach full set contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the partial set, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included. So, in 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of ten numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's. Each full block contributes 10 8's, but the last block might be partial.\n\nFrom 1-488, the blocks where the tens digit is 8 are: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. \n\nLet's count how many full blocks there are. 80-89 is one, 180-189 is another, 280-289, 380-389. That's four full blocks, each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Now, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, each of these has an 8, so that's 9 more 8's. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check that. From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, right? So, 480 is 4-8-0, 481 is 4-8-1, up to 488, which is 4-8-8. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, 9 8's there. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only when the page numbers are from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a minute, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I count correctly?\n\nWait, in the tens place for 8's, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, right? 80-89 is one, 180-189 is two, 280-289 is three, 380-389 is four, and 480-488 is five. So, each of the first four blocks is full, contributing 10 each, so 4*10=40, and the fifth block is partial, contributing 9. So, 40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 188. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me cross-verify to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nIn the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, 5*10=50.\n\nIn the units place, from 1-488, every ten numbers have one 4 in the units place, so 48 full tens (48*1=48) plus the 484, which is the 49th. So, 49.\n\nSo, 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 48 full tens (48*1=48) plus 488, which is the 49th. So, 49.\n\nTens place: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When counting the tens place for 8's, the block 480-488 is part of the tens place 8's, but 488 is the last page. So, does that mean that in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using a formula or another method to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the number of times a digit appears in a certain position can be calculated using a formula based on higher digits, current digit, and lower digits. But maybe that's overcomplicating for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the total number of digits used in the book. But perhaps that's not necessary here.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's list out the counts again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens place for 8's, I had 49, which includes 480-488 as 9 numbers. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct, and the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we need to count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n### Counting the number of 4's:\n1. **Units place**:\n   - In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of ten (1-480) and one partial set (481-488).\n   - Total 4's in the units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place**:\n   - The digit 4 appears in blocks of ten numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.\n   - Each block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4.\n   - Total 4's in the tens place: \\(5 \\times 10 = 50\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place**:\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - Total 4's in the hundreds place: \\(488 - 400 + 1 = 89\\).\n\nTotal number of 4's: \\(49 + 50 + 89 = 188\\).\n\n### Counting the number of 8's:\n1. **Units place**:\n   - In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of ten (1-480) and one partial set (481-488).\n   - Total 8's in the units place: \\(48 + 1 = 49\\).\n\n2. **Tens place**:\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks of ten numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - Each full block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 8, and the partial block (480-488) contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total 8's in the tens place: \\(4 \\times 10 + 9 = 49\\).\n\n3. **Hundreds place**:\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book only goes up to 488.\n   - Total 8's in the hundreds place: \\(0\\).\n\nTotal number of 8's: \\(49 + 49 + 0 = 98\\).\n\n### Difference:\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\(188 - 98 = 90\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{90}\n\\]"
