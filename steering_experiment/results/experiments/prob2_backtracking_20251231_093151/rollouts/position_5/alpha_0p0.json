Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place. I'll handle each position for both 4 and 8.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor 4's in the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, how many such sets are there up to 488?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 48 full sets (since 48*10=480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (at 484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: Again, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, same as above, 48 full sets give 48 eights, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 8 appears once (at 488). So total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that seems equal. So, so far, 49 each. But maybe I made a mistake because 488 is included, so let me double-check. From 1-480, there are 48 sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 4 appears at 484 and 8 at 488. So yes, 49 each. So units place: 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 every ten numbers. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nHow many hundreds do we have? Up to 488, so we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. Wait, no, actually, 488 is within the 400s, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Then, 401-488 is part of the fifth hundred but only up to 488.\n\nSo, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers each. So that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nNow, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 is only present in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, and in the last partial hundred, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 401-410: tens digit 0, 411-420: 1, ..., 481-490: 8. But since we stop at 488, the tens digit 8 is only up to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the 400s, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 more times.\n\nSo total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place: Similarly, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each of the first four hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times.\n\nIn the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but we only go up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 numbers, but since we stop at 488, it's 9 numbers. Wait, actually, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the 400s.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in the 400s.\n\nTherefore, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from first four hundreds) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's occur 50 times and 8's occur 49 times. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place.\n\nFor 4's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n4's: 48 full sets (1-480) each contributing one 4, so 48. Then 481-488: 484 is the only one, so 49 total. Correct.\n\n8's: Similarly, 48 full sets and 488, so 49 total. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n4's: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. Then in 401-488, 440-449 is 10, so total 50. Correct.\n\n8's: Each hundred contributes 10, so 4*10=40. In 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\n8's: None, since 800 is beyond 488. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For the units digit, the 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each group of 10, the units digit is 4 exactly once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit is 4 in 484, so that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, the 4 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 100 are there? That's 4 complete groups (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 numbers (401-488). In each group of 100, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 4 groups \u00d7 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial group (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive), so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of these, which is 89 times. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place again. The units digit is 8 once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10 and 8 extra numbers. So, 48 times, plus in the last group (481-488), the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place. The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. From 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 100 are there? 4 groups, as before. So, 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial group (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 more. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in the range 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (48 \u00d7 1) + 1 in the last partial group = 49.\n- Tens: 4 full groups (4 \u00d7 10) = 40, plus 10 in the last partial group (440-449) = 50.\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488) = 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups + 1 in the last partial group = 49.\n- Tens: 4 full groups \u00d710 = 40, plus in the last group (480-488) which is 9 numbers, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each 10 numbers contribute 1 '4'.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 '4' \u2192 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (484).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 '4's (e.g., 40-49).\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so 4 full groups, each contributing 10 '4's \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial group (401-488), '4' appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Each 10 numbers contribute 1 '8'.\n   - 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1 '8' \u2192 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '8' appears once (488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers contribute 10 '8's (e.g., 80-89).\n   - 488 \u00f7 100 = 4.88, so 4 full groups, each contributing 10 '8's \u2192 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - In the last partial group (401-488), '8' appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-10, the digit 4 appears once (at page 4). Similarly, from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Since the book goes up to 488, I need to figure out how many complete sets of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial set at the end.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 sets \u00d7 1 = 48 times. Now, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-488 would have 4 in the hundreds place, not the tens. Let me count how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nEach block of 100 numbers (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100, it's 40-49: 10 numbers. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149: another 10. From 201-300, 240-249: another 10. From 301-400, 340-349: another 10. From 401-488, 440-449: another 10. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, how many blocks is that? Let me see: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-488. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, yes, that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. But wait, let me check: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but I think I might be overcounting here. Let me think again. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 499, but since the book ends at 488, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 48 complete sets (as before), each contributing one 8, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, the partial set from 481-488 has units digits 1-8, so 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Let's count how many times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89: 10 numbers.\nFrom 101-200: 180-189: 10 numbers.\nFrom 201-300: 280-289: 10 numbers.\nFrom 301-400: 380-389: 10 numbers.\nFrom 401-488: 480-488: how many numbers? 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 +1 =9). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times here.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be in numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), units digits go up to 8, so 484 is included, adding one more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 4 in the tens place. From 1-100: 10, 101-200:10, 201-300:10, 301-400:10, and 401-488: 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, 5 blocks \u00d710=50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets \u00d71=48, plus 488, which adds one more, total 49.\n\nTens place: Each block of 100 has 10 numbers with 8 in the tens place, except the last block (401-488), which has 9 numbers (480-488). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9: 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's, in the tens place, in the last block (401-488), the numbers with 8 in the tens place are 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nYes, I think my calculations are correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

So, in 44, both the tens and units place are 4's, so that's two 4's. So, from 10 to 99, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10, and in the units place, it's 9, but wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, the units digit 4 appears once. There are 9 tens (10-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is a special case where the tens digit is 4, which we've already counted as 10. So, in total, for two-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, when we're in the 40-49 range, the units digits go from 0-9, so that's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place. Then, outside of that, in each ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the units digit 4 appears once. Since there are 9 such tens (excluding 40-49), that's 9 times. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let's break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400 to 488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be 0-9, and the hundreds digit can be 1-4, but again, we have to consider up to 488. Let's think about how many times 4 appears in the tens place. For each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. There are 4 hundreds, but the last hundred only goes up to 488, so from 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, for each hundred, it's 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. Wait, but wait, the last hundred only goes up to 488, but the tens digit 4 in 400-488 would still be 10 times (440-449). So, yes, 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times per hundred. Since we have 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each contributes 10 times. But wait, 400-488 has 89 numbers, so the units digit 4 would appear how many times? Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, so in each ten, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 tens (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so does that affect the count? Let me check.\n\nActually, from 400-488, the units digit 4 appears once in each ten, except maybe the last one if it's cut short. But 488 is the last page, so the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. Wait, but from 400-488, how many tens are there? From 400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488. That's 9 tens. In each of these, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 9 times. But wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, so the units digit 4 appears 9 times? Wait, but in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears 10 times, but in the last hundred, it's only 9 times because we stop at 488. So, perhaps the total units digit 4's in three-digit numbers are 3 hundreds with 10 each and the last hundred with 9, totaling 3*10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Each of the first three hundreds has 100 numbers, so the units digit 4 appears 10 times in each. The last hundred, 400-488, has 89 numbers, but the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 89 divided by 10 is 8 full tens and 9 remaining numbers. So, 8*1 + 1 (for the 4 in the 484) = 9 times. So, total units digit 4's are 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199: units 4 appears in 104,114,...,194: 10 times. Similarly, 200-299: 204,214,...,294: 10 times. 300-399: 304,314,...,394: 10 times. 400-488: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484: 9 times. So, total units digit 4's: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (10 times per hundred for 4 hundreds)\n- Units place: 39 times\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place was 40 times, but let me confirm. For each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 100-199: 140-149: 10 times. 200-299: 240-249: 10 times. 300-399: 340-349: 10 times. 400-488: 440-449: 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 times.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's:\n\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the three-digit count.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4 hundreds, 4*10=40. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, 3 hundreds contribute 10 each, and the last hundred contributes 9, so 3*10 +9=39. Correct.\n\nSo, 89+40+39=168. Then adding single and two-digit: 1+19=20, so 20+168=188. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nSingle-digit page numbers: 1-9. The digit 8 appears once, on page 8. So, 1 time.\n\nTwo-digit page numbers: 10-99. The digit 8 can appear in the tens place or the units place.\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\nUnits place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. There are 9 tens, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) +9 (units) =19.\n\nNow, three-digit page numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1,2,3,4. The digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 0 times.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is part of the last hundred, 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times except in the last hundred, where it's only 9 times (480-488). Wait, no: 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit 8 is only in 480-488 if we consider the tens place. Wait, no, 480-488 is the tens digit 8, but the units digit varies from 0-8. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all 9 numbers. So, in the hundreds place, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each of the first three hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10 times. In the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total tens digit 8's: 3 hundreds *10 +1*9=30+9=39 times.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, it's 10 times. But in the last hundred, 400-488, how many times does the units digit 8 appear? From 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times.\n\nSo, units digit 8's: 3 hundreds *10 +1*9=30+9=39 times.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, the digit 8 appears:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0\n- Tens place:39\n- Units place:39\nTotal: 39+39=78 times.\n\nNow, adding single and two-digit 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:78\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the two-digit numbers, I had 19 8's, which is correct: 10 in the tens place (80-89) and 9 in the units place (18,28,...,98).\n\nIn three-digit numbers, the tens place 8's: 3 hundreds *10 (180-189, etc.) + 9 in 480-488, so 3*10 +9=39.\n\nUnits place 8's: in each hundred, 10 times, except the last one where it's 9 times. So, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nSo, 39+39=78 in three-digit numbers. Adding single and two-digit:1+19=20, so total 8's:20+78=98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in three-digit numbers were 78, so total 98. Let me confirm:\n\nSingle-digit:1\nTwo-digit:19\nThree-digit:78\nTotal:1+19=20; 20+78=98.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:188\nTotal 8's:98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but that seems like a lot. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens 40, units 39: total 168. Then single and two-digit:1+19=20. So, 168+20=188.\n\n8's in three-digit numbers: tens 39, units 39: total 78. Single and two-digit:1+19=20. So, 78+20=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again, because sometimes when counting digits, especially in higher places, it's easy to double-count or miss something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this using a formula or a different method to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit place separately and calculate how many times the digit appears in each place.\n\nFor example, for the units place:\n\n- For 4's: In each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of 10 (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490), but since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full blocks contribute 48 times, and in the last partial block (481-488), 484 is the only number with 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 39 in three-digit numbers, but that's just the units place in three-digit numbers. Wait, no, perhaps I'm conflating different methods.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider each digit place separately across all numbers.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, total sets of 10:48 (since 488 \u00f710=48.8). So, 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's:48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\n- How many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each set of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, no, 488 is 4*100 +88, so it's 4 full hundreds and 88 extra numbers.\n\nIn each full hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's:40+10=50.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n- How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nOnly in 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89). So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99; 99+89=188. That matches my earlier count.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:\n\n- How many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each set of 10, 8 appears once. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 times. In the last partial set (481-488), 488 is included, so that's one more 8. So, total units place 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- How many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each set of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. In the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them). So, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nZero, because the hundreds digits go up to 4. So, 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) =98.\n\nThus, the difference is 188 (4's) -98 (8's)=90.\n\nWait, but earlier when I counted 8's, I thought the units place was 39 in three-digit numbers, but using this method, it's 49. There's a discrepancy here. Let me see where I went wrong.\n\nWait, in the previous approach, when I broke down three-digit numbers, I considered units place 8's as 39, but using this digit-by-digit method, it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake in the previous breakdown.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered three-digit numbers as 100-488 and counted units place 8's as 39, but that's incorrect. Using the digit-by-digit method, it's 49. So, the first approach was flawed.\n\nTherefore, the correct count is 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Using the digit-by-digit method, which seems more accurate, I have:\n\n4's: units 49, tens 50, hundreds 89. Total 188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0. Total 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the units place, each digit, including 4 and 8, should appear exactly once every ten numbers. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's in the units place. \n\nBut wait, I also have the extra 8 numbers from 481 to 488. Let me check those. The units digits here are 1 through 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they're equal. That's interesting.\n\nNext, let's move to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times per hundred. \n\nSo, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the extra 88 pages (401-488) have their tens digits from 0 to 8. Let me see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-409: the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 here.\nFrom 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no.\n...\nFrom 440-449: tens digit is 4, so that's 10 times.\nFrom 450-459: tens digit is 5.\n...\nFrom 480-488: tens digit is 8, so that's 9 times (since 488 is the last page).\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, total in the tens place: 4's are 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear once more than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 1000 numbers, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nWait, actually, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it's not printed. From 100-199, it's 1, 200-299 it's 2, 300-399 it's 3, and 400-488 it's 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding that up: 4's in hundreds place: 89, and 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the units place. Earlier, I thought that in the units place, each digit appears once every ten numbers, so for 488 pages, 48 complete sets of ten, giving 48 4's and 48 8's, plus in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 and 488 has an 8. So, that's 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in the extra 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488) and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, adding up: 4's total 188, 8's total 98, so 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's are printed 90 more times than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 188 times and the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives the difference.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 sets.\n   - 48 sets \u00d7 1 occurrence each = 48 for both 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 pages (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400): 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total tens place: 50 for 4, 49 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have both counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. That makes sense. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. \n\nNow, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from x40 to x49, where x can be 0, 1, 2, etc. Each such block has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, 140-149, etc. \n\nHow many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and a partial block from 400-488. \n\nIn each of the 4 complete blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the partial block from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449, which is another 10 occurrences. So, adding that, we get 40 + 10 = 50 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. Let's see, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the occurrences of 4: units place (48) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 48 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, the digit 4 appears 187 times.\n\nNow, I need to do the same for the digit 8. Let's start with the units place again. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8. \n\nIn each complete block, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here as well. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears in blocks like x80 to x89. Each such block has 10 occurrences. \n\nHow many complete blocks are there? Up to 400, there are 4 complete hundreds, so 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each contributes 10 times, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial block from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-489, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nWait, but hold on, from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the block where the tens digit is 8 is 480-489, but since we're stopping at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. Therefore, total tens place occurrences are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. Therefore, 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the occurrences of 8: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place: 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial block contributing 1, so 49. Tens place: 4 complete blocks, each contributing 10, so 40, plus the partial block contributing 9, so 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 187 and the number of 8's is 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's is that? 187 - 98. Let me compute that: 187 minus 98. 187 - 100 is 87, but since it's 98, which is 2 less than 100, so 87 + 2 = 89. So, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me confirm my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 48 blocks of 10, so 48, plus in the last partial block (481-488), does 4 appear in units? No, because units digits go from 1-8, so 4 is not there. So, 48 is correct.\n- Tens place: 4 complete blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89. So, total 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 48 blocks of 10, so 48, plus in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- Tens place: 4 complete blocks, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0, as there are no pages from 800-899. So, total 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 pages, so that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 8's, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are right. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll handle each digit place for both 4 and 8 and sum them up.\n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4). Similarly, in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on.\n   - To find how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10, which gives 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there's an extra 8 pages after the 48th group. So, in the units place, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, page 484 is within this range, which adds another 4. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 4 appears in the units place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have 488 pages, the units digit cycles every 10. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, meaning 48 full cycles and 8 extra pages. Each full cycle contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So, total 49 times.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In the tens place, 4 appears in a block of 10 consecutive numbers every 100 pages. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place, which is 10 times. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, etc.\n   - Let's figure out how many such blocks exist up to 488.\n   - The first block is 40-49: 10 pages.\n   - Then, 140-149: another 10.\n   - 240-249: another 10.\n   - 340-349: another 10.\n   - 440-449: another 10.\n   - Now, 488 is beyond 449, so we have another block starting at 440, but does it go beyond 449? 440-449 is 10 pages, so 440-449 is the fifth block. Now, after that, the next block would be 540-549, but 488 is less than 540, so we don't have that. So, how many blocks do we have? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 times 4 in the tens place. So, 5 x 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check: 440-449 is within 488, right? Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place, so 50 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds place is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each page from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times 4 appears.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. 49+50=99, 99+89=188. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, but let's go through it again.\n   - 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles of 10, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times.\n   - Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so page 488 is within this range, which adds another 8. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times 8 appears in the units place.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-489.\n   - Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the block, but only 9 pages (480-488). So, each block contributes 10 times except the last one, which contributes 9 times.\n   - Let's see how many such blocks exist up to 488.\n   - The first block is 80-89: 10 pages.\n   - Then 180-189: 10.\n   - 280-289:10.\n   - 380-389:10.\n   - 480-488:9 pages (since 488 is the last page).\n   - So, that's 4 full blocks and one partial block. Each full block contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. The partial block contributes 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times 8 appears in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 80-89 is 10 pages, so 10 times. 180-189 is another 10. 280-289:10. 380-389:10. Then, 480-488 is 9 pages because 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. So, total 4 x 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in pages 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again about the tens place for 4's. I had five blocks:40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5x10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, I had four full blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) and one partial block (480-488), which is 9 pages. So, 4x10=40, plus 9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nUnits place for both 4's and 8's:49 each. That seems correct because 488/10=48.8, so 48 full cycles and 8 extra pages, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place if applicable. So, 48 +1=49 each.\n\nSo, yeah, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. In the single-digit numbers, only page 4 has a 4. So that's one 4. For the two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each block of 10 (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such blocks (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, from 10 to 99, that's actually 90 numbers, so 9 blocks of 10. So, 9 times in the units place for two-digit numbers. \n\nAdditionally, in the two-digit numbers, the tens place can also have a 4. So, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. That's another 10 occurrences of 4. So, in two-digit numbers, total 4's are 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488. Let's break this down further. First, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. \n\nLet's consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place in three-digit numbers. From 100 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of hundreds. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 appears in each place.\n\nFor the units place in three-digit numbers: from 100 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10. So, how many full cycles are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. But wait, 48 full cycles would be up to 480, right? Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 more numbers, so the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's there. So, 48 times in the units place from 100 to 480, plus 0 from 481-488. So, 48 units place 4's.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place in three-digit numbers: the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each cycle (like 100-199, 200-299, etc.) has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.). So, how many hundreds do we have? From 100 to 488, we have hundreds digits 1, 2, 3, and 4. \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3: each contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So that's 3 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 30. \n\nFor the hundreds digit 4, from 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, 440-449 would be the tens digit 4, which is 10 numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10. So, total tens place 4's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place in three-digit numbers: the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: units (48) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 40 = 88 + 89 = 177. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate the three-digit numbers more carefully.\n\nUnits place: from 100 to 488, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles. The number of complete cycles is 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 in the units place. So, 48 \u00d7 1 = 48. Then, from 481 to 488, units digits are 1-8, so no 4's there. So, 48 units place 4's.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles every 100. In each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149). So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10. That's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. For the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So total tens place 4's: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 48 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 48 + 40 = 88 + 89 = 177.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Now, let's check the two-digit and single-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit: only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit: as calculated earlier, 19 occurrences (9 in units, 10 in tens).\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 177 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20 + 177 = 197.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8, so 1 occurrence.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: units place and tens place.\n\nUnits place: from 10 to 99, every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. There are 9 blocks (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 occurrences.\n\nTens place: from 80-89, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 numbers. So, 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, two-digit 8's: 9 + 10 = 19.\n\nThree-digit numbers: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits place: from 100 to 488, every 10 numbers, units digit 8 occurs once. So, how many complete cycles? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8. So, 48 occurrences. From 481-488, units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8, so that's one more. Wait, 48 \u00d7 10 = 480, so from 100 to 480, 48 cycles, each with one 8 in units place, so 48. Then, from 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 8 occurs once more at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block, the tens digit cycles. In each hundred block, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 180-189). So, for hundreds 1, 2, 3, each contributes 10. That's 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. For the last hundred block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, since 488 is the end. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 400-488, how many times does 8 appear? It's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: units (49) + tens (39) = 88.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 88\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 = 20 + 88 = 108.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Single-digit 8: 1. Two-digit: units 9, tens 10, total 19. Three-digit: units 49, tens 39, total 88. So, 1 + 19 = 20, plus 88 gives 108. So, total 8's: 108.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I calculated units place for three-digit 8's, I had 48 from 100-480, plus 1 from 488, making it 49. That seems correct. And for tens place, 30 from 100-399, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 39. So, 49 + 39 = 88. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, total 4's: 197, total 8's: 108.\n\nSo, the difference is 197 - 108 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, single-digit:\n\n4's: 1\n\n8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n\n4's: units 9 (10-99: 14,24,...,94) and tens 10 (40-49). So, 19.\n\n8's: units 9 (18,28,...,98) and tens 10 (80-89). So, 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 48 (100-480, each 10 numbers has one 4, so 480/10=48, plus 488 is beyond 480, so no extra 4's in units place beyond 480. So, 48.\n\nTens: For each hundred block 1,2,3: 10 each, so 30. For 400-488: 440-449 is 10, so total 40.\n\nHundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 40 + 89 = 177. Plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, 177 + 20 = 197.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits: 49 (from 100-488, 48 full cycles, plus 488, so 49).\n\nTens: 39 (30 from 100-399, 9 from 480-488).\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 = 88. Plus single and two-digit: 1 + 19 = 20. So, 88 + 20 = 108.\n\nDifference: 197 - 108 = 89.\n\nSo, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Single-digit pages (1-9):** Only page 4, so 1 occurrence.\n   - **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n     - Units place: 14, 24, ..., 94 \u2192 9 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: 40-49 \u2192 10 occurrences.\n     - Total: 9 + 10 = 19.\n   - **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n     - Units place: Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48 full cycles, plus one more at 488 \u2192 49 occurrences.\n     - Tens place: Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10, totaling 30.

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each full group, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. Does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 is in this range, so that's one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. Each group of ten has one 4 in the units place, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this range, adding one more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for numbers from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is a block of ten numbers. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 40-49 is one block, 140-149 is another, up to 440-449. So that's five blocks. Each block contributes ten 4's in the tens place. So 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nWait, but let me check the last block. 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: 400 is included, and 488 is included, so the count is correct as 89.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for 8's.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every group of ten numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full groups of ten are there? 48 full groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 is 48.8), so 48 groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial group from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 is in this range, which has an 8 in the units place. So that's one more. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that's the same as 4's. Hmm, but let me check: 488 is the last page, so yes, the units digit 8 appears once in the partial group. So, 49 units place 8's.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is the last block. Each full block (80-89, 180-189, etc.) contributes ten 8's in the tens place. Let's count how many full blocks there are.\n\nFrom 80-89: one block\n180-189: another\n280-289: another\n380-389: another\n480-488: this is a partial block because it ends at 488 instead of 489.\n\nSo, how many full blocks? Four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing ten 8's, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the partial block 480-488 has nine numbers (480-488 inclusive), but wait, 488 is the last page, so from 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Each of these has an 8 in the tens place. So that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's 49. Let me check: 4 full blocks \u00d710 =40, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But wait, our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers in the 800s. So, the hundreds place never has an 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's = 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier, for 4's, we had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's. But wait, let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in counting the tens place for 8's.\n\nWait, when I was counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as a partial block. Let me confirm: from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488). Each of these has an 8 in the tens place, so that's 9 occurrences. So, 4 full blocks \u00d710 =40, plus 9, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, in the tens place, we had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributing ten 4's, so 5\u00d710=50. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but for 8's, the tens place is 49, which is less than 50. So, 49 tens place 8's, plus 49 units place, so 98 total 8's. So, 4's are 188, 8's are 98, so 188 -98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. For 4's, units place was 49, and for 8's, units place was 49. That seems correct because both have the same number of groups (48 full groups and one partial group with the digit in the units place). So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. For 4's, hundreds place was 89, which is from 400-488. So, 488 -400 +1 =89. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, hundreds place is zero because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no 800s. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) =188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for 8's, I have 49, which is 40 from the four full blocks and 9 from the partial block. So, 49. Similarly, for 4's, in the tens place, it's 50 from five full blocks. So, 50.\n\nSo, the difference in the tens place is 50 -49=1.\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place, 89 for 4's and 0 for 8's, so difference of 89.\n\nIn the units place, both have 49, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference is 1 (from tens) +89 (from hundreds) =90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me recount.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place:\n\n- 80-89:10 numbers, each with 8 in tens place:10\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive)\n\nSo, 4\u00d710=40, plus 9=49. Correct.\n\nFor 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49:10\n- 140-149:10\n- 240-249:10\n- 340-349:10\n- 440-449:10\n\nSo, 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference in tens place is 50-49=1.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4's have 89, 8's have 0, so difference of 89.\n\nUnits place: same for both, so no difference.\n\nSo, total difference:1+89=90.\n\nTherefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other place. Are there any other digits beyond hundreds? No, because 488 is a three-digit number. So, we've covered units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nYes, I think that's correct. So, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** Every 10 numbers contribute one '4'. There are 48 full groups (480 numbers) and one partial group (481-488), adding one more '4'. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling five blocks, each contributing 10 '4's. Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '4' appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Total: 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', there are 48 full groups and one partial group, totaling 49 '8's.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., with four full blocks and a partial block (480-488). Total: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book doesn't reach 800. Total: 0.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:**\n   - More '4's than '8's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of '4's printed exceeds the number of '8's by 90.  \n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place and then sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For each set of ten numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears once. \n\nHow many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. \n\nNow, looking at the extra pages from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, the units place contributes 49 4's and 49 8's. Wait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Because the first 480 pages have 48 sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 more pages. The units digits in these are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 1-9) to 9 (in 90-99). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40 4's. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4 * 10 = 40 8's. \n\nNow, looking at the extra 88 pages from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nIn the range 401-488, the tens digits cycle through 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these appears 10 times except for the last one, which is only 8 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0, which is 10 pages (401-410). Then 411-420, tens digit 1, 10 pages, and so on up to 480-488, which is 9 pages because 488 is the end. \n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is the start, and 488 is the end, so that's 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place for 401-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in this range. \n\nSimilarly, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, adding this to the earlier counts: 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place, and 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me check again. The first 400 pages have 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 for both. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, so 40 + 10 = 50 4's in the tens place. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Let's see, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488, which is 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3, or 4. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times and 8's appear 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of 4's and 8's is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 40 + 10 = 50 4's. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40 + 9 = 49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's. 8's in hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems right. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Since the book has 488 pages, there are 488 / 10 = 48 full blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in each block, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. But wait, the last partial block from 481-488 includes 484, which has a 4 in the units place, so that's one more. So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred block, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit in 481-488 is 8, so no 4's in the tens place here. Therefore, total tens place 4's: 40.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (40) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. So, there are 178 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. \n\nStarting with the units place: Just like with 4's, every block of 10 has one 8. So, 48 full blocks (480 pages) give 48 8's, and the last 8 pages (481-488) include 488, which has an 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: In every block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for exactly 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, in each hundred, that's 10 8's. There are 4 full hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but 480 is part of the 400-499 range. Wait, actually, 480 is in the 400-499 range, so the tens digit is 8 from 480-489. But our book ends at 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 8's? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers, so that's 9 more 8's. So total tens place 8's: 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 8's in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. I think I might have made a mistake there. Let's see: From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred block, it's 10 times. So, for 1-100, it's 80-89, that's 10. For 101-200, it's 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, I said 0, which is correct because 800-899 isn't included.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 178, and 8's were 98. So, the difference is 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) plus 1 in 484, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) = 40. The last partial hundred (401-488) doesn't have any 4's in the tens place, so 40.\n- Hundreds place: 89 numbers (400-488), so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) plus 1 in 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (each contributing 10) = 40. Plus 9 from 480-488, so 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place for 4's. Let me think again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of those has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 80. Therefore, there are 80 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The partial block (401-488) has no '4's in the tens place.\n   - Total: 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400 to 488, each number has a '4' in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 numbers.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 178.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, '8' appears once.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488).\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The partial block (401-488) includes 480-488, which has 9 '8's in the tens place.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n178 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 80.\n\n$\\boxed{80}$"

Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit position separately: units place, tens place, and hundreds place.\n\nFirst, for the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. \n\nBut wait, starting from 1, the first block is 1-10, so the units digits are 1-0. Then 11-20 would be 1-0 again, and so on. So, for the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in each block of 10, 4 appears once. Similarly, 8 appears once in each block.\n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages (since 48*10=480, and 488-480=8). \n\nWait, but I think I need to adjust that. Because the first block is 1-10, the next is 11-20, and so on up to 481-490. But 488 is less than 490, so the last block is 481-488, which is only 8 pages. So, in the units place, for each complete block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once. So, in 48 complete blocks, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, for units place, both digits appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place in each block of 100.\n\nSo, in each 100-page block, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89). \n\nNow, how many complete 100-page blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a remaining 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 blocks, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, so that's 4*10=40 times. Similarly, 8 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place in these blocks. \n\nNow, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nLooking at 401-488, the tens digits are from 0 to 8. The tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449, which is 10 numbers (440,441,...,449). But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit is 8 in the range 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. \n\nWait, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is included and 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial block. \n\nWait, but earlier, in each 100-block, we had 10 times for each digit. So, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, total 4's are 4*10 (from the complete blocks) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50 times. \n\nAnd total 8's in the tens place are 4*10 (from complete blocks) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49 times. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. From 1-400, each 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49. So, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times. \n\nWait, but wait, in the last partial block, 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but the 4's in the tens place are only from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's correct. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in the hundreds place, the digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book goes up to 488. \n\nIn the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 4 appears as follows:\n\n- Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (not printed, since page numbers are 1-99, which are two-digit or single-digit). So, no 4's or 8's in hundreds place here.\n\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. So, 1 appears 100 times in the hundreds place. But neither 4 nor 8 appear here.\n\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2. Again, no 4's or 8's.\n\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3. Still, no 4's or 8's.\n\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nNow, does the digit 8 ever appear in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's:\n\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in units place. 488 pages mean 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488). In the units place, 4 appears once in each block (48 times) plus once in the last block (484), so 49. Similarly, 8 appears once in each block (48 times) plus once in 488, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) give 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 4's, and 480-488 is 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's:40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again if I counted correctly in the tens place for the last partial block. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for 4 in the tens place, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of digits printed. Each page from 1-9 has 1 digit, 10-99 has 2 digits, 100-488 has 3 digits.\n\nTotal digits:\n\n- 1-9:9 pages *1=9 digits\n- 10-99:90 pages *2=180 digits\n- 100-488:389 pages *3=1167 digits\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits.\n\nNow, total digits counted for 4's and 8's: for 4's, 188 times, for 8's, 98 times. So, total digits accounted for by 4 and 8:188+98=286. But 286 is less than 1356, which is fine because we're only counting specific digits.\n\nWait, but maybe I can check the total number of 4's and 8's in another way. For example, how many times does each digit appear in each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to confirm.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- 488 pages, so units digit cycles 48 full times (1-480) and 8 extra (481-488). Each full cycle has one 4 and one 8. So, 48*1=48 each. Then, in the last 8 pages, 481-488, the units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units:48+1=49, 8's:48+1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks (1-400) give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears in 440-449:10 times. 8 appears in 480-488:9 times. So, total 4's:40+10=50, 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Only in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - '4' appears once in each block (48 times) and once in the extra pages (484), totaling 49.\n   - '8' appears once in each block (48 times) and once in the extra pages (488), totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), contributing 40 each.\n   - In 401-488, '4' appears 10 times (440-449), and '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total '4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total '8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

That makes sense. Let me start by figuring out how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each position: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each block of 10 numbers. So, in the first 10 pages (1-10), the digits in the units place go from 1 to 0. Wait, actually, 10 is the first page with a 0 in the units place, so maybe I should consider from 1 onwards. Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of blocks of 10, 100, etc.\n\nLet me try to approach this systematically. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nIn the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once every 10 numbers. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the digits 1-0 appear in the units place. From 11 to 20, the units digits go from 1 to 0 again, and so on.\n\nBut since our book ends at 488, which is not a multiple of 10, I need to adjust for the last partial block.\n\nSo, total number of pages is 488. Let me calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are and how many numbers are left over.\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and 8 extra numbers (481 to 488).\n\nIn each complete block of 10, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for each block, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once.\n\nTherefore, in 48 complete blocks, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and the number of 8's is also 48.\n\nNow, for the remaining 8 numbers (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding these, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, so units digits from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, yes, total units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each block of 100. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). Each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers.\n\nSo, let's see how many complete hundreds we have in 488. 488 divided by 100 is 4 with a remainder of 88. So, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488).\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nSo, for 4 complete hundreds, the number of 4's in the tens place is 4 * 10 = 40, and the same for 8's: 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFrom 401 to 488, the tens digit goes through 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digit goes up to 8.\n\nWait, let me clarify: from 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit is 0\n- 411-420: tens digit is 1\n- 421-430: tens digit is 2\n- 431-440: tens digit is 3\n- 441-450: tens digit is 4\n- 451-460: tens digit is 5\n- 461-470: tens digit is 6\n- 471-480: tens digit is 7\n- 481-488: tens digit is 8\n\nEach of these blocks has 10 numbers except the last one, which has 8 numbers (481-488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- Digit 4 appears in the tens place from 441-450, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times.\n- Digit 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, 8 times.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, we have 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 occurrences of 8.\n\nAdding this to the previous counts:\n\nTotal 4's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from remaining 88) = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from remaining 88) = 48.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me double-check:\n\nFrom 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (441-450) and 8 for 8 numbers (481-488). So, 10 and 8 respectively.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, pages 100-199 have 1 in the hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 does not appear in the hundreds place at all.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFirst, for the digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that.\n\n49 + 50 = 99.\n\n99 + 89 = 188.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188.\n\nNow, for the digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, let me check that addition again.\n\n49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 97.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n- 48 complete blocks: 48 each.\n- Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 4 and 8 each appear once.\n- So, total units: 48 + 1 = 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each block of 100 has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 4 complete hundreds: 40 each.\n- Remaining 88 pages: 10 4's and 8 8's.\n- So, total tens: 40 +10 =50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n- 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. Wait, from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those 89 pages, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second, in the hundreds place, when we're counting 4's, each page from 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times. But when counting 8's, since the book ends at 488, there's no page with hundreds digit 8, so 0.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers (481-488). So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. Each time the tens digit is 4, it's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, it's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nYes, so 10 and 8 respectively. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, right? So, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the units place, I considered 481-488 as 8 numbers, so units digits from 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. That's correct.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\n\n8's:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the units place. Let me think: for each block of 10, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 49 each. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, in the units place, from 1-488, each digit appears how many times? For digits 1-9, it's a bit different because the first block starts at 1, not 0. Hmm, maybe I should use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in the units place.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N / 10).\n\nEach complete group contributes one occurrence of d.\n\nThen, the remainder: N % 10.\n\nIf the remainder is >= d, then add 1, else add 0.\n\nWait, but in our case, N is 488, so floor(488 /10)=48, remainder=8.\n\nSo, for digit 4:\n\nNumber of times in units place: 48 + (if 8 >=4, then 1 else 0) =48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly for digit 8: 48 + (if 8 >=8, then 1 else 0)=48 +1=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, the formula is a bit different. The number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N is:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor(N / 100).\n\nEach complete group contributes 10 occurrences of d in the tens place.\n\nThen, the remainder is N % 100.\n\nIf the remainder >= 10*(d+1), then add 10.\n\nElse, add (remainder - 10*d +1) if remainder >=10*d, else 0.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many full tens and then the partial.\n\nBut in our case, for the tens place, we can calculate it as:\n\nFor each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, which is 4 hundreds and 88 pages.\n\nSo, for the first 400 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 4*10=40 times in the tens place.\n\nThen, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), we need to see how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nAs before, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488).\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place, it's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place, it's from 481-488, which is 8 numbers.\n\nSo, adding to the previous counts:\n\n4's: 40 +10=50.\n\n8's:40 +8=48.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place, the number of times a digit d appears in the hundreds place from 1 to N is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds where the hundreds digit is d.\n\nFor N=488, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages.\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 does not appear at all.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488-400+1=89.\n\nYes, so each of those pages has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times.\n\nAnd since the book doesn't go beyond 488, there's no hundreds digit of 8, so 0.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the final answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 48 complete blocks of 10: 48 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 1 occurrence each of 4 and 8.\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 4 complete hundreds: 40 occurrences each of 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 88 numbers: 10 occurrences of 4 (441-450) and 8 occurrences of 8 (481-488).\n   - Total: 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 occurrences of 4.\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{91}."

Let me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nFirst, I'll count the number of 4's. Let's go through each position one by one.\n\n1. Units place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and then 8 more numbers. So, in each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is within this range, adding one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. How many such blocks are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the last partial block 401-488. Each full block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 480-488, and 4 for 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is part of 401-488, so the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (440-449). So that's 10 more 4's. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, looking at the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding all these up: units place 49 + tens place 50 + hundreds place 89 = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, I'll do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Again, for every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, every block of 100 has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (like 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 480-488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for each, so that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So yes, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 from the full blocks plus 9 gives 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place. When I considered the tens place for 4's, I had 4 full blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, and then in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 more, making it 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I had 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, so 40, and then in 401-488, 480-488 gives 9 more, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place for 4's, I considered 400-488 as 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Let me check: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89, yes.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, but each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 400 is the first page with hundreds digit 4, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, there are none. So, 0.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, and then subtract the two to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same for 8. So, for example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). \n\nBut wait, since the book has 488 pages, I need to figure out how many complete groups of 10 there are and then see if there's a partial group at the end. Let me calculate the number of complete tens in 488. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times each. Now, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). \n\nSo, total 4's in the units place: 48 (from complete groups) + 1 (from partial group) = 49. Similarly, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. Hmm, so the difference here is zero. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, so 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. How many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 4, the last term is 484, and the common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. Same for 8's: 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. The last term is 488, so ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, yes, both are 49 in the units place. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49) and 8 ten times (80-89). \n\nBut since we're going up to 488, let me break it down. From 1-400, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, in each hundred, like 1-100, 100-200, etc., the tens digit is 4 exactly 10 times. So, from 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, so 4 * 10 = 40 times. \n\nWait, but from 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 400-488) = 50. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages (480-488). Wait, no, 480-489 is 10 pages, but we only have 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, let me check: 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers. So, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 pages, right? Because 480 is included, and 488 is the last page. So, that's 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nSo, 4's in the tens place: 50, 8's: 49. So, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the count for 4's in the tens place. From 1-400, each hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 4, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct. \n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place: from 1-400, 4 * 10 = 40. From 400-488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 40 + 9 = 49. So, yes, 50 vs 49, difference is +1 for 4's. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488, right? So, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nWhat about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0. \n\nSo, for the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89. \n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place. \n\nUnits place: 49 - 49 = 0. \n\nTens place: 50 - 49 = +1. \n\nHundreds place: 89 - 0 = +89. \n\nSo, total difference is 0 + 1 + 89 = 90. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 4's total: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. \n\n8's total: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. \n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts again. \n\nUnits place: For 4's, from 1-488, every 10 pages, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra pages. Each full ten contributes 1 four, so 48. Then, in the last 8 pages (481-488), 484 is included, so that's one more four, total 49. Same for 8's: 48 full tens with 1 eight each, and 488 is included, so one more, total 49. So, units place is correct. \n\nTens place: 4's: From 1-400, each hundred has 10 pages with 4 in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, 400-488, 440-449 is 10 pages, so 40+10=50. 8's: From 1-400, 4*10=40. From 400-488, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 40+9=49. So, tens place: 50-49=+1. \n\nHundreds place: 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 fours. 8's: none, so 0. So, +89. \n\nSo, total difference is 1 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 90. \n\nWait, but when I calculated the total number of 4's and 8's, I got 188 and 98, which also gives a difference of 90. So, that seems consistent. \n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - For every 10 pages, '4' and '8' each appear once in the units place.\n     - Total groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete groups and 8 extra pages.\n     - In each group, '4' and '8' appear once, totaling 48 each.

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to get the difference. Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place one by one.\n\n1. Units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, so that's 8 numbers: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. In this last group, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: Similarly, for the tens place, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred block, the tens digit is 4 exactly once, for 10 numbers. So, 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40 occurrences. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on. The last partial hundred is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. So, 401-488 includes the 440-449 block, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. Hundreds place: Now, the hundreds digit. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 occurrences of the digit 4.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\n1. Units place: Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. In the units place, 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. Tens place: For the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 occurrences, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial hundred is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 8 for numbers 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488. So, 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 occurrences. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me double-check. The tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 occurrences in the tens place for the last partial hundred. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 4. 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Plus, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. Total 50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1. Total 49.\n\n- Tens: Each hundred block has 10 numbers with tens digit 8. 4 blocks, so 4*10=40. Plus, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9. Total 49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly in the tens place for 8's. In the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488. Wait, 480 is in 401-488, right? 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's correct. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10. So, 4*10=40 +10=50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: Let's count how many 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor any digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- For units place: (n / 10) + min(n % 10, d) if d != 0, else (n / 10).\n\nWait, but maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, for each digit position, calculate the number of times each digit appears.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me stick to my initial method.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct: 188 4's and 98 8's, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the first thing I should do is figure out how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers, and then do the same for the digit 8. Once I have the counts for both digits, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Then from 11 to 20, it's 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 again, and so on. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 also appears once. \n\nNow, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and then an additional 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of these 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once per block, so that's also 48 times. \n\nBut wait, in the incomplete block from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding those, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. Hmm, so in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each. That means the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, and the same for 8.\n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, so in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. \n\nNow, looking at the incomplete hundred from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Let's see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, it's 2; 431-440, it's 3; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; 461-470, it's 6; 471-480, it's 7; and 481-488, it's 8. \n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in the block 441-450 (specifically, 440-449, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 441-450). Wait, actually, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times in the hundreds place, but in the incomplete hundred, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except maybe the last one. Wait, no, because 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens blocks (each 10 pages) and 8 pages. Wait, actually, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except the last one, which only goes up to 8 pages. Wait, no, because 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8 full tens (each 10 pages) plus 8 pages. So, the tens digits from 0 to 7 each appear 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). \n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. From 401-410, tens digit is 0 (10 times). 411-420, tens digit 1 (10 times). 421-430, tens digit 2 (10 times). 431-440, tens digit 3 (10 times). 441-450, tens digit 4 (10 times). 451-460, tens digit 5 (10 times). 461-470, tens digit 6 (10 times). 471-480, tens digit 7 (10 times). 481-488, tens digit 8 (8 times). \n\nSo, in the incomplete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (from 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (from 481-488). \n\nSo, in the tens place, the total for 4's is 4 hundreds * 10 times each = 40, plus 10 times in the incomplete hundred, so 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nFor 8's in the tens place, it's 4 hundreds * 10 times each = 40, plus 8 times in the incomplete hundred, so 40 + 8 = 48. \n\nWait, that can't be right because in the incomplete hundred, the tens digit 8 only appears 8 times, so 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's in the tens place. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, the difference here is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to page 488. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. \n\nFrom page 100 to 199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. So, the difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit across all places.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, earlier, I thought the difference in the units place was zero, but let me confirm:\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 48 full blocks (each contributing 1) + 1 in the last block = 49\n- 8's: Same, 49\nSo, units: 49 vs 49, difference 0.\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 10 in the incomplete hundred (441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus 8 in the incomplete hundred (481-488) = 48\nDifference: 50 - 48 = 2\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 89\n- 8's: 0\nDifference: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 4's appear 91 times more than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct because each of those pages has 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor the tens place, in the incomplete hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50; 8's: 4*10 +8=48. So, difference 2.\n\nUnits place: both 49, so no difference.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units)+48 (tens)+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer might be 91, but I want to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this by counting the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nLet me try another approach for units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nUnits digit:\n\nFor each digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place up to n is given by:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(n/10)\nPlus 1 if the remainder is >= d.\n\nBut in our case, n=488.\n\nSo, for digit 4 in units place:\n\nNumber of complete groups: 488//10=48\nRemainder: 488%10=8\nSince 8 >=4, add 1\nTotal: 48 +1=49\n\nSimilarly for digit 8:\n\nNumber of complete groups:48\nRemainder=8 >=8, so add 1\nTotal:48 +1=49\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, difference 0.\n\nTens digit:\n\nFor the tens place, each digit d appears in each block of 100, 10 times. So, number of times digit d appears in tens place is:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds: floor(n/100)\nEach contributes 10 times for each d.\nPlus, in the incomplete hundred, the number of times d appears is:\n\nLet rem = n%100\nIf rem >= 10*d, then add 10\nElse if rem >= d*10, add (rem - 10*d +1)\nWait, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nFor the tens digit, the count is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10\nremainder = n % 100\nif remainder >= 10*d:\n    count += 10\nelif remainder >= (d * 10):\n    count += (remainder - (d * 10) + 1)\nelse:\n    count += 0\n\nWait, maybe an easier way is to calculate how many full tens blocks there are beyond the hundreds.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that for the tens digit, each digit d appears 10 times for each hundred. So, for 488 pages:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds:4 (since 4*100=400 <=488)\nSo, 4*10=40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 488-400=88 pages, which is from 401-488.\n\nIn the tens place, for the incomplete hundred (401-488), we need to see how many times each digit appears.\n\nThe tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-488, where the tens digit is 8.\n\nSo, for the tens digit, in the incomplete hundred:\n\n- For digits 0-7: each appears 10 times (since each block is 10 pages)\n- For digit 8: appears only 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 pages)\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place in the incomplete hundred: it's in the block 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place in the incomplete hundred: it's in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nTherefore, total for tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 4*10 +10=50\n- Digit 8:4*10 +8=48\n\nSo, difference in tens place:50-48=2.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nDigit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nThus, total for hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4:89\n- Digit 8:0\nDifference:89-0=89\n\nAdding up the differences:\n\nUnits:0\nTens:2\nHundreds:89\nTotal difference:0+2+89=91\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears 91 times more than the digit 8 in all page numbers.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just cross-verify by calculating total number of digits.\n\nWait, maybe not necessary, but just to be thorough.\n\nTotal number of digits printed:\n\nFrom 1-9: 9 numbers, 1 digit each =9 digits\nFrom 10-99:90 numbers, 2 digits each=180 digits\nFrom 100-488:389 numbers, 3 digits each=1167 digits\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356 digits\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary here, since the problem is only about the count of 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, another way to check: if 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 97 times, the difference is 91, which seems correct based on the earlier calculations.\n\nI think I've considered each place separately and accounted for each occurrence correctly. So, the final answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by considering each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. Here, the digit 4 appears once (at 4) and the digit 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. \n\nSo, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 groups, that's 48 times each. Then, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, here, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, adding that up, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's: 48 +1 =49. \n\nWait, but hold on, the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so units digits go up to 8. So yes, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (in 1-9) to 9 (in 90-99). So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for the digit 4, it appears 10 times in the tens place in each 100-number block, same for 8. \n\nNow, how many complete 100-number blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete block, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 blocks, that's 4*10=40 each. Now, the partial block is 401-488. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, 5 for 451-460, 6 for 461-470, 7 for 471-480, and 8 for 481-488. \n\nWait, but in this range, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times. \n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 is only 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in the partial block. \n\nSo, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nAdding that to the complete blocks: 4's in tens place total is 40 (from 4 blocks) + 10 (from partial) = 50. 8's in tens place total is 40 + 8 = 48. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, it's 10 numbers except for the last one, which is only 8 numbers because 488 is the end. \n\nSo, for 4 in the tens place, it's 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so 8 times. \n\nSo, yes, 4's tens place: 50, 8's tens place: 48. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero in page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only counting 4's and 8's. \n\nFrom 100-488, the hundreds digit cycles as follows: \n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, in each of these blocks, the hundreds digit is fixed. \n\nSo, for 4 in the hundreds place: pages 400-488. How many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nFor 8 in the hundreds place: Well, in the range 1-488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 would be beyond 488. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0. \n\nSo, now, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\n\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let me add these up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4's appear 188 times.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\n\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, wait, let me check that again. 49 (units) + 48 (tens) = 97. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. \n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract 97 from 188: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- Each 10 pages: 1 occurrence of 4 and 8.\n- 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages.\n- So, 48*1 = 48, plus 1 in the last partial group: total 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each 100 pages, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n- So, 4 blocks of 100: 4*10=40 for 4's and 8's.\n- Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (441-450) and 8 for 8 pages (481-488).\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8's: 0 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut let me just cross-verify to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to consider each digit place separately and sum up the occurrences.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 488 pages, the number of times each digit appears in the units place is floor(488/10)*1 + min(488 mod 10, 9) if the digit is less than the remainder. Wait, no, maybe a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in the units place.\n\nActually, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally often except possibly the last partial group.\n\nSo, total number of times a digit d appears in the units place is:\n\n- Number of complete decades: floor(488 / 10) = 48\n- Each complete decade contributes 1 occurrence of d.\n- Then, in the last partial decade (481-488), check if d is <= (488 mod 10). So, 488 mod 10 is 8. So, if d <=8, then it appears once; if d=9, it doesn't appear.\n\nSo, for 4: 48 +1 =49\nFor 8: 48 +1=49\n\nSame as before.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach digit d appears in the tens place:\n\n- For each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place, except possibly the last hundred if it's incomplete.\n\nSo, for 488 pages, how many hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.) and a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each digit.\n\nIn the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each digit d from 0 to 8, it appears 10 times if d is less than 8, but for d=8, it appears only 8 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, actually, in the partial hundred, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but since the book ends at 488, it's only up to 488, so the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers.\n\nSo, for each digit d in 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place in the partial hundred?\n\n- For d=0: 10 times (401-410)\n- d=1: 10 times (411-420)\n- d=2: 10 times (421-430)\n- d=3: 10 times (431-440)\n- d=4: 10 times (441-450)\n- d=5: 10 times (451-460)\n- d=6: 10 times (461-470)\n- d=7: 10 times (471-480)\n- d=8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place: 10 times in the partial hundred.\nFor digit 8 in the tens place: 8 times in the partial hundred.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 4*10 +10=50\n- 8: 4*10 +8=48\n\nSame as before.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nAs before, 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens)+89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49+48+0=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've checked it thoroughly. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers from 1 to 488 is 188, and the digit 8 appears 97 times. Therefore, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by separating the problem into single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages: 1 to 9. Here, the digits 4 and 8 each appear once, right? So, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. So, for single-digit pages, the count for 4 is 1 and for 8 is also 1. The difference here is 0.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit pages: 10 to 99. Now, I need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately. \n\nLet's start with the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, for the tens digit being 4, the numbers would be 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, for the tens digit being 8, the numbers would be 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten. So, in each ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, etc.), and the same goes for 8 (e.g., 18, 28, etc.). There are 9 tens (10-99), so for each digit, 4 and 8, they each appear 9 times in the units place. Wait, actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, so 9 groups of 10. So, for each digit, it's 9 times in the units place. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total count for 4 is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. Similarly, for 8, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, the difference in two-digit numbers is also 0.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages: 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because now we have hundreds, tens, and units places to consider. Let me break this down further.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, numbers from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nI need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place. In 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, so neither 4 nor 8 appears here. In 200-299, the hundreds digit is 2, so again, no 4 or 8. Similarly, 300-399 has 3 in the hundreds place, so no 4 or 8. Now, 400-488 has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are here? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place in three-digit numbers because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit is only 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, moving to the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred group separately.\n\n1. For 100-199: The tens digit can be 0-9, so for each ten, like 100-109, 110-119, etc., the digit 4 and 8 can appear in the tens place. Similarly, for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nWait, but since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 0-9 in each hundred group. So, for each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9, and each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. But wait, for 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, but the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities, not 10. So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me handle each hundred group separately.\n\n1. 100-199: Tens digit can be 0-9, so for each digit 4 and 8, they each appear 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, in the units place, for each ten, each digit appears once, so for each hundred, in the units place, each digit appears 10 times.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate for each place (hundreds, tens, units) across all three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate for each digit place separately across all three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, starting with the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488)\n- 8 appears 0 times (since hundreds digit doesn't reach 8)\n\nNow, the tens place:\n\nIn three-digit numbers from 100-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, for each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488), the tens digit goes through 0-9, except for the last group (400-488), where the tens digit goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399, each has 10 possibilities for the tens digit (0-9), so each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred group. So, for each of these three groups, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nBut for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, which is 9 possibilities. So, in the tens place, for 400-488, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, so 4 appears once when the tens digit is 4, and 8 appears once when the tens digit is 8.\n\nWait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit can be 0-8, so for each tens digit, there are 10 numbers (units 0-9), except for the last one, which is 488, so units go up to 8. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. The tens digit in 400-488 is 0-8, so for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 numbers except for the last one, which is 488. Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 has only 9 numbers (480-488). Hmm, this complicates things a bit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the tens digit occurrences as follows:\n\nFor each hundred group, except the last one (400-488), the tens digit runs from 0-9, so each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. For the last hundred group, 400-488, the tens digit runs from 0-8, so each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times in the tens place, except for 8, which appears 9 times because 488 is the last page, so units go only up to 8.\n\nWait, no, actually, in 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, but for each tens digit, how many numbers are there? For tens digits 0-7, each has 10 numbers (units 0-9), but for tens digit 8, it's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- For tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times\n- For tens digit 8: appears 9 times\n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place, so 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n- For 400-488: 4 appears 10 times (tens digit 4, units 0-9) and 8 appears 9 times (tens digit 8, units 0-8). So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n- 4: 30 + 10 = 40\n- 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and tens digit 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, total for tens place in three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 10 from 400-488, total 40\n- 8: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 from 400-488, total 39\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers.\n\nIn each hundred group, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten. So, for each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), in the units place, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times per hundred group, except for the last group (400-488), where the units digit might be limited.\n\nWait, but in 400-488, the units digit goes up to 8 in the last number (488). So, for 400-488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nLet me think. For each ten in 400-488, the units digit goes from 0-9 except for the last ten, which is 480-488, where units go from 0-8.\n\nSo, for 400-479, each ten (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) has 10 numbers, so each digit in units place appears 10 times. For 480-488, units go from 0-8, so each digit 0-8 appears once, but 9 doesn't appear. So, for the units place in 400-488:\n\n- For digits 0-8: each appears 9 times (once in each ten except the last ten, where they appear once more)\n- Wait, no, perhaps better to calculate as follows:\n\nIn 400-488, there are 89 numbers. The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, except the last ten (480-488) which has units 0-8.\n\nSo, for each digit in units place:\n\n- Digits 0-8: appear 9 times each (once in each ten from 400-479, and once in 480-488)\n- Digit 9: appears 8 times (in 409, 419, ..., 479), so 8 times\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nFrom 400-479, that's 80 numbers, which is 8 tens (400-409, ..., 470-479). Each ten has 10 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears 8 times in the units place for 400-479. Then, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, units digits 0-8 appear once each. So, total for units place:\n\n- For digits 0-8: 8 (from 400-479) + 1 (from 480-488) = 9 times each\n- For digit 9: 8 times (only in 409, 419, ..., 479)\n\nSo, in the units place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each digit appears 30 times in the units place (3 hundreds \u00d7 10 times each)\n- For 400-488: digit 4 appears 9 times, digit 8 appears 9 times, and digit 9 appears 8 times\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in each hundred group (100-199, etc.), the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each ten, so each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each digit appears 10 times in the units place per hundred, so 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 times each.\n\nIn 400-488, as we determined, digit 4 appears 9 times, digit 8 appears 9 times, and digit 9 appears 8 times. So, total for units place:\n\n- Digit 4: 30 (from first three hundreds) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39\n- Digit 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n- Digit 9: 30 + 8 = 38\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, digit 4 appears 9 times in the units place, and digit 8 appears 9 times as well. So, total for units place:\n\n- 4: 30 + 9 = 39\n- 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89\n  - 8: 0\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 40\n  - 8: 39\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 39\n  - 8: 39\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nNow, let's add up the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4: 1\n- 8: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4: 19\n- 8: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4: 168\n- 8: 78\n\nTotal:\n- 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), correct.\n- Tens place: 40 times for 4, 39 for 8. Let me verify:\n  - 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 for 8 in the tens place, so 3\u00d710=30 each.\n  - 400-488: tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 30+10=40 for 4, 30+9=39 for 8. Correct.\n\nUnits place:\n- 100-199, etc.: 3\u00d710=30 each for 4 and 8.\n- 400-488: 9 each for 4 and 8. So, 30+9=39 each. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit counts:\n- 4: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168\n- 8: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\n- 4: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n- 8: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because in the tens place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times. So, in the three-digit numbers alone, 4 appears more than 8 by 1 in the tens place, which contributes to the overall difference.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, they're equal, but in the hundreds place, 4 has a significant advantage.\n\nSo, yes, the total difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - Each digit (4 and 8) appears once.\n   - Count: 4 \u2192 1, 8 \u2192 1.\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:** Each digit appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49 for 4, 80-89 for 8).\n   - **Units Place:** Each digit appears 9 times (once per ten).\n   - Total for two-digit:\n     - 4: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n     - 8: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n     - 8 appears 0 times.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - 4 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n     - 8 appears 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n   - Total for three-digit:\n     - 4: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - 8: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\n4. **Total Counts Across All Pages:**\n   - 4: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n   - 8: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between these two counts. Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit page number that has a 4 is page 4. So, that's one occurrence of the digit 4.\n\nNext, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. I should consider both positions separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers from 40 to 49 have a 4 in the tens place. That's 10 numbers (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49), so that's 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: In the two-digit numbers, the 4 can appear in the units place for numbers like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 44 has two 4's, so I need to be careful not to double count. However, since I'm just counting the occurrences, each occurrence is counted separately, so 44 contributes two 4's. So, from 10-99, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: from 10-99, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 occurrences. But wait, in the 40-49 group, we've already counted the tens place, but the units place in 40-49 would include 44, which has an extra 4. So, actually, from 10-99, the units place 4's are 9 times, but in the 40-49 group, the units place 4 is 44, which is already counted in the tens place. Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating. The units place 4's are in 14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94. That's 9 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the units place, except 44, which has an additional 4 in the tens place, but since we're only counting units place here, it's still just one 4 per occurrence. So, 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 44 has two 4's, so in the two-digit numbers, 44 contributes two 4's, so the total would be 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but 44 is included in both counts, so actually, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but 44 is counted twice, so the actual total is 19, because each occurrence is counted separately. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. These are a bit more complex because there are three places: hundreds, tens, and units. I'll need to consider each place separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, when the hundreds digit is 4, the numbers go up to 488, so we have to be careful with the range.\n\nFor the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 can appear in the tens place for numbers like x4y, where x is the hundreds digit (1,2,3,4) and y is the units digit (0-9). However, we have to ensure that the number doesn't exceed 488.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: The tens digit can be 4, so numbers from 140-149. That's 10 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the tens place.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 240-249: 10 numbers.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: 340-349: 10 numbers.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: Now, we have to be careful because the numbers go up to 488. So, the tens digit can be 4, but the units digit can go up to 8. So, numbers from 440-449: that's 10 numbers, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. Wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is okay. So, that's another 10 numbers.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, for the tens place, the number of 4's is 10 (for hundreds digit 1) + 10 (hundreds digit 2) + 10 (hundreds digit 3) + 10 (hundreds digit 4) = 40.\n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit can be 4, and the units digit can be 0-9, but since the book ends at 488, the maximum number is 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place for three-digit numbers: 40.\n\nNow, the units place: The digit 4 can appear in the units place for numbers like xy4, where x is the hundreds digit and y is the tens digit.\n\nAgain, considering each hundreds group:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: The units digit can be 4 for numbers 104,114,124,134,144,154,164,174,184,194. That's 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 204,214,...,294: 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 304,314,...,394: 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: Now, the units digit can be 4, but the number must be \u2264488. So, the numbers would be 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. Wait, 404,414,...,484. Let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. Wait, 404 to 484 with step 10: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers.\n\nWait, but 484 is 484, which is less than 488, so that's fine. So, for hundreds digit 4, units digit 4 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in the units place for three-digit numbers: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: for hundreds digit 4, from 400-488, how many numbers have units digit 4? Starting at 404, each 10 numbers: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488, and 494 would be beyond 488, so yes, 9 numbers.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 10+10+10+9=39.\n\nTherefore, for three-digit numbers, total 4's are:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, 1+19 is 20, plus 168 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit number with an 8 is page 8. So, that's one occurrence.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99):\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 occurrences.\n\nUnits place: The digit 8 appears in the units place for numbers like 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98. That's 9 numbers, but 88 has two 8's. So, in the units place, how many times does 8 appear? Each occurrence is counted separately, so 18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98: that's 9 numbers, each contributing one 8 in the units place, except 88, which has an additional 8 in the tens place, but since we're only counting units place here, it's still just one 8 per occurrence. So, 9 times in the units place.\n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 8's is 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19.\n\nWait, but 88 is included in both counts, so the total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19, but 88 has two 8's, so the actual total is 19, because each occurrence is counted separately. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 can't appear in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3, or 4. So, 0 occurrences here.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for numbers like x8y, where x is the hundreds digit (1,2,3,4) and y is the units digit (0-9).\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: 180-189: 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: 280-289: 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 380-389: 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 480 +1 = 9 numbers. So, for hundreds digit 4, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nNow, the units place: The digit 8 appears in the units place for numbers like xy8, where x is the hundreds digit and y is the tens digit.\n\nAgain, considering each hundreds group:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: The units digit can be 8 for numbers 108,118,128,138,148,158,168,178,188,198. That's 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, 208,218,...,298: 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 3: 308,318,...,398: 10 numbers.\n\n- Hundreds digit 4: The units digit can be 8, but the number must be \u2264488. So, numbers like 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last one.\n\nSo, total 8's in the units place: 10 (hundreds 1) + 10 (hundreds 2) + 10 (hundreds 3) + 9 (hundreds 4) = 39.\n\nTherefore, for three-digit numbers, total 8's are:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, 1+19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nThree-digit: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n\nThree-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's handle the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each full group, there's one 4, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once in 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49). So, how many such blocks are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. In each full block, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 gives 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place. Similar to 4, in each group of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full groups of ten (as before) and an extra 8 pages. So, 48*1 = 48, and in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears in 488. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). So, 4*10 = 40. Now, in the partial block 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488). So, that's 9 more. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's there.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, did I count correctly? Let me double-check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. That seems right. For the tens place, in the 401-488 block, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, correct. And the units place, 488 is included, so 48 +1=49 for 4's in units. For 8's, the tens place in 401-488 is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40 +9=49. So, yes, 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full groups of ten (each contributing one 4) plus one in the last partial group, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (each contributing ten 4's) plus ten in the last partial hundred, totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 numbers from 400-488, each contributing one 4.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** 48 full groups of ten plus one in the last partial group, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 full hundreds (each contributing ten 8's) plus nine in the last partial hundred, totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's as the book doesn't reach 800.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's a 4 in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? That's 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8. But since we can't have a fraction of a group, there are 48 complete groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 fours. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 490, but since the book ends at 488, the last group isn't complete. However, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no, actually, when I do 488 divided by 10, it's 48 full groups (each contributing a 4 in the units place) and then 8 extra numbers. So, from 1 to 480, there are 48 fours in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, the digit 4 appears in groups of 100. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, 240-249, etc. So, how many such groups are there up to 488?\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many hundreds are there. The book goes up to 488, which is less than 500, so we have four hundreds: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears once for 10 numbers. So, in 100-199, 140-149: 10 numbers. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, four hundreds would contribute 4 * 10 = 40 fours. But wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, so 440-449 is within that. So, yes, that's 10 numbers. So, total tens place 4's are 40.\n\nWait, let me check again. From 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 fours in the tens place. Then, 140-149: another 10, 240-249: another 10, 340-349: another 10, and 440-449: another 10. That's 5 groups of 10, so 50 fours in the tens place. Wait, but earlier I thought it's four hundreds, but actually, it's five groups because from 40-49 is part of the first hundred (1-100). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. The tens digit 4 appears in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five ranges, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nBut wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 fours.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place. That's 48 eights. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNow, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is part of it.\n\nSo, how many such ranges are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10\n- 280-289: 10\n- 380-389: 10\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488)\n\nWait, no, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's are 4 groups of 10 (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) contributing 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, so total 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 eights. 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49. So, 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Units: 49, tens:49, so total 98 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units was 49 and tens was 49, so total 98 eights. So, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in units, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 ranges, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 488 has an 8 in units, so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges. 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-488:9. So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in 4's. Earlier, I thought 440-449 is part of 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so yes, 10 fours in tens place there. So, 5 ranges, 50 fours.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 eights in tens place.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: 488 pages. So, when counting units place for 4's, from 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then 484 is the 49th. So, 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full times, and then 488 is the 49th. So, 49.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, we have 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50.\n\nFor 8's, 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389,480-488. That's 5 ranges, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 4*10 +9=49.\n\nSo, yes, 50 fours in tens place, 49 eights in tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 4's have 89, 8's have 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm missing something. For example, in the hundreds place, 400-488: that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. But in the tens place, 440-449 is included in 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, 480-488 is included in the tens place count, so that's correct.\n\nI think that's right. So, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n**Counting the digit '4':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 '4's.\n   - Additionally, in the range 481-488, the number 484 has a '4' in the units place, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the tens place in ranges like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 '4's.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit '4' appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers.\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 89.\n\n**Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the digit '8':**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to '4', the digit '8' appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete groups, contributing 48 '8's.\n   - Additionally, the number 488 has an '8' in the units place, adding 1 more.\n   - **Total in units place:** 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - The digit '8' appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are 5 such ranges (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488), contributing 10 '8's each except the last range.\n   - The range 480-488 contributes 9 '8's.\n   - **Total in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is '8' (since the book ends at 488).\n   - **Total in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n**Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n- Number of '4's - Number of '8's = 188 - 98 = **90**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

Let me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can systematically count the occurrences without missing any.\n\nStarting with the digit 4:\n\n1. **Units place:** In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. But since we're looking at the units place, each full set contributes one 4. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set (481-488), does the units digit 4 appear? Yes, 484 is within that range, so that's one more. So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** Now, looking at the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes ten 4's in the tens place. Let's count how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. However, we need to check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, total tens place 4's: 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNext, let's do the same for the digit 8:\n\n1. **Units place:** Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:** The digit 8 appears in the tens place in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each block contributes ten 8's. Let's count the blocks. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. That's four blocks. So, 4 x 10 = 40. But wait, is there a 480-489 block? Yes, but 480-488 is within the book's pages. So, does that count? Let's see, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is nine numbers. So, in the tens place, how many 8's are there? From 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for all ten places? Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so the tens digit is 8. So, from 480 to 488, that's nine numbers, each with 8 in the tens place. So, that's nine more. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9 from 480-488. Wait, no, actually, the 480-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so it's another block. Wait, earlier I considered four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), but 480-489 is another block, but since we only go up to 488, it's only 480-488, which is nine numbers. So, each full block contributes 10, but the last one contributes 9. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks x 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 180-189: 10 8's.\n- 280-289: 10 8's.\n- 380-389: 10 8's.\n- 480-488: 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 4 x 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. For the units place, both 4 and 8 have 49 each. For the tens place, 4 has 50 and 8 has 49. For the hundreds place, 4 has 89 and 8 has 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8. I think I might have made a mistake there. Let me recount the tens place for 8.\n\nIn the tens place, 8 appears in:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 180-189: 10 8's.\n- 280-289: 10 8's.\n- 380-389: 10 8's.\n- 480-488: 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place:\n\n- 40-49: 10 4's.\n- 140-149: 10 4's.\n- 240-249: 10 4's.\n- 340-349: 10 4's.\n- 440-449: 10 4's.\n\nWait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 numbers. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 x 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I missed something in the units place for 8. Let's see:\n\nUnits place for 8: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so that's one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place: same calculation, 48 full sets, plus one more in 484, so 49.\n\nSo, I think the counts are accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 89 occurrences.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens place:** 49 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 0 occurrences.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are. Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For each group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, the 4 is in 4; from 11-20, it's in 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many such groups of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 will have a 4 in the units place. That adds one more, making the total for units place 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The digit 4 can also appear in the tens place. In this case, every block of 100 numbers has ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. \n\nHow many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are four full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 numbers (401-488). In each of the four full blocks, the tens digit is 4 for exactly ten numbers, so that's 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for the numbers 404-408 and 414-418, but wait, actually, let me correct that. The tens digit is 4 in the 400s, specifically from 400-409, but since we only go up to 488, it's 400-409, but 400 is page 400, which is part of the 401-488 range. Wait, no, 400 is actually part of the 400-499 range, but our book ends at 488. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but 400 is included in 401-488? Wait, no, 400 is page 400, which is in the 400-409 range, but 401-409 would be part of 401-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in 400-409, but since our range is 401-488, the numbers 400 is not included. Wait, actually, page 400 is included in the 400-409 range, but our upper limit is 488, so 400-409 is entirely within 401-488? No, because 400 is page 400, which is before 401. Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify. The tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges is ten numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, right? Because 440-449 have 4 in the tens place, and 400-439 have 0-3 in the tens place, and 440-449 have 4, then 450-488 have 5-8 in the tens place. So, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for ten numbers: 440-449. So, that's another ten 4's in the tens place. Therefore, in the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, making it 50 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 400-488 includes 440-449, which is another 10, so the total would be 4*10 +10=50. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place had 49, and now the tens place has 50. Let me check that again. The units place: from 1-488, every ten numbers have one 4 in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens and 8 extra numbers. So, 48*1=48, plus in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, 48+1=49 in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place: for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9, so in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers. So, from 1-100, 40-49: 10 numbers. From 101-200, 140-149: another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349 each add 10. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449: another 10. So, that's 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 440-449, making it 50. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's.\n\nNow, what about the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, from 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488-400+1=89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll go through the same process.\n\nStarting with the units place: similar to 4's, in every ten numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1-488, how many 8's in the units place? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 48+1=49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for exactly ten numbers: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389. Each of these contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) each contributing 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers (480-488). So, total in the tens place is 40+9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place contributes 0.\n\nTherefore, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49+49=98\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such sets are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of 10 and then a partial set from 481 to 488. In each full set, the units digit is 4 once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set, 484 is within 481-488, so that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, in the tens place, we have 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's.\n\nAdding up the 4's from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, every set of 10 numbers has one 8 in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets and a partial set from 481-488. Each full set contributes 1 8, so 48 times. The partial set includes 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But wait, our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, how many full blocks are there? From 1 to 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so the tens digit 8 occurs in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one has only 9 numbers instead of 10. So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 8's, and the last block contributes 9 8's. So, total 8's in the tens place: (4 * 10) + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 would appear in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's here.\n\nAdding up the 8's from units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 8's in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's there are than 8's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full sets (1-480) with 1 each, so 48, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: 5 blocks, each 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full sets (1-480) with 1 each, so 48, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488: 5 blocks, first four with 10 each, last with 9, so 4*10 +9=49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each block, there's one 4 in the units place. That would give me 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, I also have the 484 page, which is in the 48th block plus 4 more pages (481-488). So, does that add another 4 in the units place? Let me see: 484 is the 4th page in that last partial block, so yes, that's another 4. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. For the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. So, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then a partial block from 401-488. \n\nIn each full block, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks times 10 is 40. Now, in the partial block from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-409, 8 for 410-419, 2 for 420-429, etc. Wait, actually, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, in the 400-499 range, the tens digit is 4 only in 440-449. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, adding that, 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 4's in the tens place. So, yes, that's correct. So, total tens place 4's are 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, units place: 48 full tens blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial block (481-488) has 484, which is another 4 in the units place, so 49 total. \n\nTens place: Each full hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) contributes 10 4's in the tens place. There are 4 full blocks, so 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place, I considered 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial block (481-488) has 484, which is another 4 in the units place, so 49 total. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block has 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 blocks give 40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, totaling 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 4's.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which includes 488. So, in that last partial block, the units digit is 8 in 488, so that's another 1. So, total units place 8's: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place. For example, 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, the last block is 480-488. \n\nSo, how many full hundreds blocks are there? 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. \n\nNow, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me check again. Units place: 48 full blocks, each with 1, so 48. Then, 488 adds another, so 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks, each with 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) =98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks (1-480), each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place, so 1 more, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each with a 4, so 89.\n\nSo, 49 +50 +89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits: 48 full blocks, 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\nTens: 4 full blocks, 40, plus 480-488, which is 9, so 49.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo, 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I double-counted somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when counting the tens place for 4's, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. That's correct because 440-449 is within 401-488.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8, but 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 -480 +1=9.\n\nWait, but 480 is included, so 480,481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. That's 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nSo, 40 +9=49 for tens place 8's.\n\nUnits place: 48 full blocks, 48, plus 488, which is 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's:49+49=98.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any overlap or double-counting? For example, in the number 448, does it have both a 4 in the hundreds and tens place, and a 8 in the units? But when counting each digit place separately, we're just counting each occurrence, so 448 would contribute to both the hundreds, tens, and units counts. But since we're counting each digit place separately, it's correct.\n\nSimilarly, 488 would contribute to units and tens, but again, each digit is counted in its own place.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me check the hundreds place for 4's again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nBut wait, 488 -400 +1=89. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nAnd for 8's, 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the key here is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8, then find the difference. That makes sense because each digit's occurrence can be calculated separately for each place value.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's consider each place one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. In the units place, the digits cycle from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, I need to figure out how many such blocks there are in 488 pages.\n\nWait, but 488 isn't a multiple of 10, so the last block will be incomplete. Let me think. The total number of complete blocks of 10 in 488 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 more pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, except for the last incomplete block where digits 1-8 appear once each. But since we're only interested in 4's and 8's, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times in the complete blocks, and then once more in the last block (484). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 48 times in the complete blocks and once in the last block (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1 to 480, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 48 times in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and same for 8's: 48 +1=49. So, the count for units place is equal for both 4 and 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSince we have 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the digit 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n\nNow, in the partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419 is 1; 420-429 is 2; 430-439 is 3; 440-449 is 4; 450-459 is 5; 460-469 is 6; 470-479 is 7; 480-488 is 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once (440-449), which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, in the last partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total for tens place:\n\nFor 4's: 4 hundreds * 10 times each = 40, plus 10 in the last partial hundred, so 40 +10=50.\n\nFor 8's: 4 hundreds *10 times each=40, plus 9 in the last partial hundred, so 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 have 0 in the hundreds place, pages 100-199 have 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4.\n\nSo, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nThe digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. The hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear there.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that: 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is the only one with 4 in units. So, 48 +1=49. Same for 8's: 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full times, and 488 is the only one in the last partial block, so 48 +1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, 10 times for each digit. So, 4 hundreds (1-400) each contribute 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both.\n\nThen, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, for 4's in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. For 8's: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50. 8's: 40 +9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. 8's: 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 +50 +89=188. 8's:49 +49 +0=98. Difference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, right? Because 488 -400 +1=89. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. And 8 never appears there. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: in the hundreds place, digits go from 0 to 4. So, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. 8 doesn't appear in hundreds place.\n\nSo, yes, the total counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit's occurrence in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in the units place from 1 to 480.\n   - From 481 to 488, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred. For 488 pages, 4 full hundreds contribute 40 times each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Once I have those counts, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at page 4). In 11-20, it appears once (at page 14), and so on. So, to find out how many times 4 appears in the units place up to 488, I can divide 488 by 10 and take the integer part. That would be 48 full tens, so 48 times. But wait, I should check if 488 itself has a 4 in the units place. 488 ends with an 8, so no additional 4 in the units place beyond the 48 times. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then the remaining 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. That's 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on. The tens digit 4 would appear in 440-449. Let's see, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to fours, in every block of 10, 8 appears once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens. But wait, 488 is included, so the units digit 8 appears in 8, 18, ..., 488. Let me check: 488 / 10 is 48.8, so there are 49 occurrences of 8 in the units place because 488 is the 49th occurrence. Wait, that might be a mistake. Let me think again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, which means 48 full times, but since 488 is included, the last occurrence is at 488, so that's 49 times. Hmm, but wait, 488 is the 49th multiple of 10 starting from 8. Wait, actually, the units digit cycles every 10, so from 1 to 488, there are floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 is 8. Let me check: 488 mod 10 is 8, so yes, the number of 8's in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place gives 49 eights.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in blocks of 100, specifically from 80-89 in each hundred. So, in each hundred, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But wait, 480-489 is within 401-488, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 numbers. So, total tens place eights would be 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought the hundreds place for 4's was 89, but for 8's, it's zero. So, total eights are 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 1-400, we have four hundreds, each contributing 10 eights in the tens place, so 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, units place: 49 eights.\n\nSo, total eights are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for fours, I had 187 fours. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89. So, 89 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours.\n\nUnits place for fours: From 1-488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times, but wait, 488 ends with 8, so the last 4 in the units place is at 484, which is the 48th occurrence. So, units place fours: 48.\n\nTens place for fours: In each hundred, 40-49 gives 10 fours. So, four hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 4 x 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place for fours: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nEights: units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer is 89 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each set of 10 consecutive numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there?\n   - Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488).\n   - In each complete set of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 4, 14, 24, etc.), and the digit 8 appears once (e.g., 8, 18, 28, etc.).\n   - So, for 48 complete sets, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place.\n   - Now, the partial set from 481 to 488: the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n   - Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Now, moving to the tens place. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers. For example, 40-49 have 4 in the tens place.\n   - Let's figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place from 1 to 488.\n   - The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 (since 400 is the fourth hundred).\n   - In each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 and 8, each appears 10 times per hundred.\n   - So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8.\n   - But wait, we need to check if 488 is within the 500s, but since 488 is less than 500, we don't have a partial hundred after 400. So, actually, from 1 to 400, it's 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place.\n   - Now, from 401 to 488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). Let's break this down:\n     - From 401 to 409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8.\n     - From 410 to 419: tens digit is 1, so no.\n     - ...\n     - From 440 to 449: tens digit is 4, so 10 times for 4.\n     - From 450 to 459: tens digit is 5, no.\n     - ...\n     - From 480 to 488: tens digit is 8, so 9 times (since 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488).\n   - Wait, but earlier I thought from 1 to 400, it's 40 times for each. But in the 401-488 range, we have an additional 10 times for 4 (from 440-449) and 9 times for 8 (from 480-488). So, total for tens place:\n     - 4's: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n     - 8's: 40 (from 1-400) + 9 (from 480-488) = 49\n   - Wait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40 each. But from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digit cycles again. So, perhaps I should calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488 separately.\n   - Let me try a different approach. The number of times a digit appears in the tens place can be calculated by considering how many full groups of 100 there are and then the partial group.\n   - For the tens place, the number of times a digit d appears is:\n     - Number of complete hundreds = floor(488 / 100) = 4\n     - For each complete hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n     - So, for 4 and 8, that's 4 * 10 = 40 each.\n     - Now, for the remaining pages after 400, which is 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8.\n     - So, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n       - The tens digit cycles every 10 pages. So, how many complete tens are there in 88 pages?\n       - 88 / 10 = 8.8, so 8 complete tens and a partial of 8 pages.\n       - For each complete ten, each digit 0-9 appears once in the tens place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Each ten (like 401-410, 411-420, etc.) has the same tens digit for 10 pages. So, for each ten, the tens digit is fixed for 10 pages.\n       - So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488).\n       - Let's count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place in this range.\n       - For 4 in the tens place: the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n       - For 8 in the tens place: the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Since 488 is the end, that's 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 times.\n       - Therefore, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n       - Adding to the 40 from the complete hundreds:\n         - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50\n         - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49\n   - So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Now, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in page numbers from 100 onwards.\n   - Let's see, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since the book has 488 pages).\n   - We need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many pages have 4 in the hundreds place? That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive).\n   - But wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n   - What about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\n4. **Total Count:**\n   - Now, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n   - For 4's:\n     - Units: 49\n     - Tens: 50\n     - Hundreds: 89\n     - Total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n   - For 8's:\n     - Units: 49\n     - Tens: 49\n     - Hundreds: 0\n     - Total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n   - So, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? As I calculated earlier, 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in the last partial set (481-488), 484 has a 4, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, plus 488, so 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8 in the tens place. So 40 each.\n- From 401-488: 440-449 is 10 pages with 4 in tens, and 480-488 is 9 pages with 8 in tens.\n- So, 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure about the hundreds place. Let me confirm. Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: from 1-399, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, or 3, so no 4 or 8. From 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98, so 90 more 4's.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears equally in each set of 10 pages.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488 pages, plus 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - 4 appears 49 times (48 + 1).\n   - 8 appears 49 times (48 + 1).\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in each set of 100 pages.\n   - From 1-400, each digit appears 40 times (4 hundreds \u00d7 10).\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total:\n     - 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 never appears.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digit 4 appears exactly once, on page 4. So, single-digit pages contribute 1 four.\n\nNext, for two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, the digit 4 can appear in the tens place or the units place. Let me calculate each separately.\n\nFor the tens place: The numbers would be 40-49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor the units place: The numbers would be 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. That's 9 numbers because 44 has two 4's, but I'm only counting the units place here. Wait, no, actually, each of these numbers contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 9 times. But wait, 44 has a 4 in both tens and units, so in the units place, it's still just one 4. So, from 10 to 99, the units place 4's are 9 times, and the tens place 4's are 10 times. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19.\n\nWait, but actually, when I count the units place, it's every 10 numbers, so from 10-19, 20-29, etc., each has one 4 in the units place. So, from 10 to 99, there are 9 decades (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times. But wait, 40-49 is the tens place, so that's 10 numbers. So, yes, 10 in tens place and 9 in units place, total 19 4's in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. Let me break this down further into hundreds, tens, and units places.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, let's see:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Pages 100-199. How many 4's are there in the hundreds place? None, because the hundreds digit is 1.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: Pages 200-299. Similarly, hundreds digit is 2, so no 4's here.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: Pages 300-399. Again, hundreds digit is 3, so no 4's here.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: Pages 400-488. Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every page from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place. Let's count how many that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's consider the tens place in three-digit numbers. The tens digit can be from 0 to 9, and we're looking for when it's 4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 occurs in a block of 10 pages. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149. Similarly, in 200-299, it's 240-249, and so on.\n\nBut since the book goes up to 488, we need to check if the 400-488 range affects this. Let's break it down:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: Pages 100-199. The tens digit 4 occurs in 140-149, which is 10 pages. So, 10 4's in the tens place.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: Pages 200-299. Similarly, 240-249, another 10 4's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: Pages 300-399. 340-349, another 10 4's.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: Pages 400-488. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 pages. So, 10 4's in the tens place here as well.\n\nSo, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers are 10 (for 100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40.\n\nWait, but wait a second. For 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. So, 40 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit can be 0-9, and we're looking for when it's 4. For each hundred, the units digit 4 occurs once every 10 pages. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences (once per ten pages). Let's check each hundred:\n\n- For hundreds digit 1: 100-199. The units digit 4 occurs in 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 2: 200-299. Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 3: 300-399. 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 times.\n\n- For hundreds digit 4: 400-488. The units digit 4 occurs in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, let's count these. From 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 484. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nWait, but wait, in the 400-488 range, how many units digit 4's are there? Let's list them:\n\n404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers, so 9 4's.\n\nSo, total units place 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers are:\n\nHundreds place: 89\n\nTens place: 40\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I need to count how many times 8 appears in page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): 8 appears once, on page 8.\n\nTwo-digit pages (10-99):\n\nTens place: 80-89. That's 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nUnits place: 18, 28, 38, 48, 58, 68, 78, 88, 98. That's 9 numbers, but wait, 88 has two 8's, but I'm only counting the units place, so it's still 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's in two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19.\n\nThree-digit pages (100-488):\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, only when hundreds digit is 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit doesn't reach 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nTens place: For each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs in a block of 10 pages. Let's check each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: 180-189. 10 pages, so 10 8's.\n\n- 200-299: 280-289. 10 8's.\n\n- 300-399: 380-389. 10 8's.\n\n- 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages because 488 is the last page. So, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. That's 9 pages, each with an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's here.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred, the units digit 8 occurs once every 10 pages. Let's check each hundred:\n\n- 100-199: 108, 118, 128, ..., 198. That's 10 times.\n\n- 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 times.\n\n- 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 times.\n\n- 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included, but 498 would be beyond 488, so we stop at 488.\n\nSo, units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\nTens place: 39\n\nUnits place: 39\n\nTotal: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, let me check that addition: 1 + 19 is 20, plus 78 is 98. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's:\n\nNumber of 4's: 188\n\nNumber of 8's: 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to miscount, especially in the three-digit numbers.\n\nLet me recalculate the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\nFirst, the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, there are 48 complete sets of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once here as well, on page 484. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each set of 100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, for each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nHow many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's another 10 occurrences. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, because 401-488 is 88 pages, which is less than 100. So, does 440-449 fall within 401-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's correct, 10 more 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yep, so 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. \n\nTotal sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 complete sets (480 pages) and 8 extra (481-488). In each set, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. In the extra 8 pages, units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once on page 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similar to the 4's, the tens digit is 8 for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. So, in each hundred, 80-89, 180-189, etc. \n\nNumber of complete hundreds in 488: 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. \n\nNow, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, but wait, 401-488 is from 401 to 488, so the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. Wait, but 480 is within 401-488? No, 480 is less than 488, so 480-488 is part of the last partial hundred. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, but 480-488 is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, but 480 is 480, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, does that mean 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place in the last partial hundred?\n\nWait, but let's think again. The tens digit is 8 for numbers where the tens place is 8, regardless of the hundreds. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. But 480 is part of 401-488, right? So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all these, so that's 9 times. So, in the last partial hundred, we have 9 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I thought the tens digit for 4 in 401-488 was 10 times (440-449). So, maybe the same logic applies here. But in this case, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 489 is beyond 488. So, it's 9 numbers. So, total 8's in the tens place would be 40 (from the four complete hundreds) plus 9 (from the last partial hundred) = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For each complete hundred, it's 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about 4's, I had 10 in the last partial hundred. Hmm, maybe because 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers, but 480-488 is only 9. So, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit is never 8 in this book. So, 0 occurrences.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but wait a second, let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? For each 10 numbers, it's once, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once on 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place, as we thought, 49 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, when counting 4's, I had 188, and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 8's in the tens place. So, in each complete hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, which are beyond 488, so 0. So, correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the 4's in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 times. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me recount the 4's in the units and tens places to make sure.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in 481-488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once on 484. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds * 10 = 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That's correct.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188. Yep.\n\nFor 8's: Units place, 48 complete sets *1=48, plus 1 in 488, so 49. Tens place: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all cases correctly. For example, in the units place, when counting 4's, I included 484, which is correct. Similarly, for 8's, I included 488. \n\nWait, but in the tens place for 8's, I included 480-488, which is 9 numbers, but does 480 count as a page? Yes, because 480 is less than 488. So, that's correct.\n\nHmm, I think I did everything correctly. So, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two to find the difference. Let me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. \n\nHow many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the complete sets, plus one more time in the partial set (page 484). So, units place contributes 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of 10 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, in the 140-149 range, and so on. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, the first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, every subsequent hundred would have another block. So, in 1-100, there's one block (40-49). In 101-200, another block (140-149). Similarly, in 201-300, 240-249, and in 301-400, 340-349. Then, in 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, but since 488 is less than 450, we only go up to 449. So, how many blocks is that?\n\nFrom 1-400, there are four blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). Each contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in 401-488, the block would be 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10 occurrences. So, total for the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is less than 450, so 440-449 is within 401-488. So yes, that's correct. So, 50 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the occurrences of 4: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. Starting with the units place: Similar to 4, in each set of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488? As before, 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8. So, 48 times from the complete sets, plus one more in the partial set (page 488). So, units place contributes 49 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks of 10 numbers, such as 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). \n\nSo, let's count the blocks:\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 is one block, contributing 10 times.\n\nFrom 101-200: 180-189 is another block, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 201-300: 280-289, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 301-400: 380-389, another 10 times.\n\nFrom 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, each subsequent block is 10 numbers, except the last one, which is only 9 because 488 is the last page. So, 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, totaling 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, zero times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total occurrences of 8: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nNow, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete sets (480 numbers) give 48, plus 484, so 49.\n\n- Tens: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). Wait, that's five blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. But earlier, I thought 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks, 5*10=50.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 48 complete sets (480 numbers) give 48, plus 488, so 49.\n\n- Tens: 80-89 (10), 180-189 (10), 280-289 (10), 380-389 (10), and 480-488 (9). So, 10+10+10+10+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens place in 8's. From 80-89, that's 10 numbers, so 10 times. Similarly, each subsequent hundred has another 10, so 180-189, etc. So, up to 380-389, that's four blocks, each 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. That's five blocks, each 10, so 50. Correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct, so the difference is 90.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. With 48 complete sets (480 numbers) and one partial set (481-488), 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc., totaling 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears 49 times.\n- **Tens place:** Blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc., totaling 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear, so 0 times.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8. Then, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers. In each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 * 1 = 48, and similarly, 8's would also be 48. But wait, there are 8 extra numbers beyond the 480th page, which are 481 to 488. In these, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the 481-488 range, the digit 4 appears once (at 484) and the digit 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, the total for units place is 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each. That means the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each hundred, 10 times each. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4's and 40 times for 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining 88 pages are from 401 to 488. Let's break this down. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. Specifically, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-490, but wait, our last page is 488, so the last part is 481-488, where the tens digit is 8. \n\nWait, actually, let's correct that. From 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460: 5, 461-470: 6, 471-480: 7, and 481-488: tens digit 8. \n\nSo, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450. That's 10 numbers, but wait, 441-450 is 10 numbers, but our range is up to 488, so 441-450 is entirely within 401-488. So, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in this range. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times here.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 401-488, the tens digits go as follows:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 numbers)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 numbers)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 numbers)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 numbers)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 numbers)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 numbers)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 numbers)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 numbers)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 numbers)\n\nSo, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in 441-450, and the digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488. \n\nTherefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 4 (from the complete hundreds) * 10 = 40, plus 10 from 441-450, totaling 50. For 8's, it's 4 * 10 = 40 from the complete hundreds, plus 8 from 481-488, totaling 48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, and 8's appear 48 times. That means the difference in the tens place is 50 - 48 = 2 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. For pages 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute to either 4's or 8's. From 100 onwards, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4, since the book has 488 pages.\n\nSo, let's see how the hundreds digit 4 appears. Pages 400-488 have the hundreds digit as 4. That's 89 pages (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. \n\nWhat about the hundreds digit 8? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. Therefore, the count for 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's appear 89 times, and 8's appear 0 times. The difference here is 89 - 0 = 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 (difference 0)\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48 (difference +2)\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 (difference +89)\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations because 91 seems a bit high, but let me verify each step.\n\nFirst, units place: from 1-488, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) add 1 more each for 4 and 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 each. Correct.\n\nTens place: Each complete hundred (1-100, etc.) has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50; 8's: 40 + 8 = 48. Difference of +2. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: Only from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, difference of +89. Correct.\n\nTotal difference: 0 (units) + 2 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the hundreds place, is it 89 times? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. In the 401-488 range, the tens digit 4 is in 441-450, which is 10 pages. So, that's correct. And the tens digit 8 is in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, 8 occurrences. So, 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, 8's:40+8=48. So, +2.\n\nUnits place: 49 each, so 0 difference.\n\nHundreds place: 89-0=89.\n\nTotal: 0+2+89=91. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: 488-400+1=89. So, 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. Correct.\n\nAnd for the 8's in the hundreds place, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0. Correct.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the total number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place every 10 numbers.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 blocks.\n   - Each block contributes 1 occurrence of 4 and 1 of 8.\n   - Total from blocks: 48 each.\n   - Remaining 8 numbers (481-488): 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\n   - Total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's; same for 8's.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred in the tens place.\n   - Complete hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total from complete hundreds: 4 * 10 = 40 for both 4's and 8's.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4's in tens place: 10 times (441-450).\n     - 8's in tens place: 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's; 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n   - Difference: 50 - 48 = +2.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488: 89 pages with hundreds digit 4.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total hundreds place: 89 for 4's; 0 for 8's.\n   - Difference: 89 - 0 = +89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +2\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Combined: 0 + 2 + 89 = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

That makes sense.\n\nLet me start by considering single-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, how many 4's are there? Well, only page 4 has a 4. So that's one 4. How about 8's? Similarly, only page 8 has an 8, so that's one 8. So in single-digit pages, the count is 1 for both 4 and 8. So the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should consider each digit position separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Well, from 40 to 49, that's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, how about 8 in the tens place? From 80 to 89, that's another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place: For each ten's group, the units digits cycle from 0 to 9. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? In each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so 9 times. Wait, but actually, from 10 to 99, that's 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, 4 appears 9 times in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 10-19, the units digit 4 is at 14, so that's one. From 20-29, it's 24, another one. Continuing this way up to 90-99, which is 94. So that's 9 times, yes. Same for 8: 18, 28, ..., 98, which is 9 times. So, in two-digit numbers, 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So again, the difference is zero so far.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because there are three digit places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me tackle each place separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, for the hundreds digit being 4, how many numbers are there? From 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place here.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred separately, from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488.\n\nFor each hundred group, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. So, for each hundred group, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's 10 times per hundred. Since there are four hundred groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), but wait, 400-488 isn't a full hundred. Let me check each group:\n\n1. 100-199: The tens digit 4 appears in 140-149, which is 10 times.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 240-249, 10 times.\n3. 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n4. 400-488: Here, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so yes, 10 times.\n\nSo, total times 4 appears in the tens place in three-digit numbers: 10 (100s) + 10 (200s) + 10 (300s) + 10 (400s) = 40 times.\n\nNow, how about 8 in the tens place? Let's see:\n\n1. 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n2. 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n3. 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n4. 400-488: Now, 480-489 would be where 8 is in the tens place, but our book ends at 488. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nSo, total for 8 in the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me make sure. For 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 39 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred group:\n\nFor each hundred group, the units digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, in each hundred, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's once per ten numbers, so 10 times per hundred. Let me check each group:\n\n1. 100-199: 104, 114, 124, ..., 194. That's 10 times.\n2. 200-299: Similarly, 204, 214, ..., 294. 10 times.\n3. 300-399: 304, 314, ..., 394. 10 times.\n4. 400-488: Now, from 400 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see, 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total for 4 in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nNow, for 8 in the units place:\n\n1. 100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198. That's 10 times.\n2. 200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298. 10 times.\n3. 300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398. 10 times.\n4. 400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times because 488 is included.\n\nSo, total for 8 in units place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. For 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, yes, 39 times total.\n\nNow, let me summarize the three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 in hundreds place: 89 times\n- 4 in tens place: 40 times\n- 4 in units place: 39 times\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 times.\n\nSimilarly for 8's:\n\n- 8 in hundreds place: 0 times\n- 8 in tens place: 39 times\n- 8 in units place: 39 times\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 times.\n\nWait, that seems off. Wait, I thought earlier that in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times because from 400 to 488, which is 89 numbers. But when I was counting 4's in the units and tens places, I considered each hundred group separately, but maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no, I think I did it correctly. Let me check again.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400 to 488 inclusive). That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for the first three groups, and in the last group, 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So 10*4=40 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the units place, for each hundred group, 4 appears 10 times, except in the last group (400-488), where it appears 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 10+10+10+9=39 times. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's:\n\nIn the hundreds place, none, since 800-899 isn't in the book.\n\nIn the tens place, for each of the first three hundred groups, 8 appears 10 times, and in the last group, 480-488, which is 9 times. So 10+10+10+9=39 times.\n\nIn the units place, same as 4's: in each hundred group, 10 times, except the last group where it's 9 times, so 10+10+10+9=39 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78 times.\n\nWait, but I think I missed something. When I was counting 8's in the tens place, for 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. But in the units place, 8 occurs in 408, 418, ..., 488, which is 9 times as well. So, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's: 78.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4's are 168, 8's are 78, so 168 - 78 = 90 more 4's than 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, let me add up all the counts from single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nSingle-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I had 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168 for 4's. For 8's, it's 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nThen, adding single and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit: 1 each\nTwo-digit: 19 each\nThree-digit: 168 and 78\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut let me double-check the three-digit counts because that's where most of the numbers are.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (400-488). Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred group, 4 appears 10 times, and there are four groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 times in each group, so 4 groups * 10 = 40. Correct.\n\nIn the units place, for each hundred group, 4 appears 10 times except in 400-488, where it's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for 8's, tens place: 10 times in each of the first three hundred groups, and 9 times in 400-488. So, 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 times in each of the first three hundred groups, and 9 times in 400-488. So, 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78 for 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the total 4's are 188, 8's are 98, difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the two-digit numbers. I had 19 4's and 19 8's. Let me confirm that.\n\nIn two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99:\n\nTens place: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nUnits place: For 4, in each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), 4 appears once in the units place, so 9 groups * 1 = 9 times. Similarly for 8, 9 times.\n\nSo total 4's: 10 + 9 = 19\nTotal 8's: 10 + 9 = 19\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 90. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. In the three-digit numbers, when I'm counting the hundreds place, I included 400-488, which is 89 numbers. But when I'm counting the tens and units places, I considered each hundred group separately, including 400-488 as a separate group. So, is there any overlap or double-counting? I don't think so because each digit position is considered separately.\n\nAnother thing to check: in the three-digit numbers, when I count 4's in the hundreds place, those are 89 distinct numbers, each contributing one 4. Similarly, when I count 4's in the tens and units places, those are in different positions, so no overlap. So, the counts are additive.\n\nSame for 8's: in the tens and units places, they don't interfere with each other.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488 and finding the difference.\n\n1. **Single-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 9 times (14, 24, ..., 94), 8 appears 9 times (18, 28, ..., 98).\n   - Total for two-digit pages: 19 times each for 4 and 8.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), totaling 40 times. 8 appears 10 times in the first three groups and 9 times in 400-488, totaling 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 10 times in each hundred group except 400-488, where it appears 9 times, totaling 39 times. 8 appears similarly 39 times.\n   - Total for three-digit pages: 4's = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168, 8's = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I can subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. \n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such numbers are there? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. Dividing 488 by 10 gives 48 full groups of 10 and a remainder of 8. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. That would be 48 times. But wait, the last group is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. So, does 484 fall into this group? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total units place 4's would be 48 + 1 = 49? Wait, no, because the first 48 groups are 1-480, each contributing one 4 in the units place, and then 481-488 has 484, which is another 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49 units place 4's.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? From 1-488, the hundreds go up to 4 (since 488 is less than 500). So, there are 5 blocks: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Wait, no, the first block is 1-99, so the tens place 4's occur in 40-49 (10 times), 140-149 (10 times), 240-249 (10 times), 340-349 (10 times), and 440-449 (10 times). But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's valid. So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's okay. So, 50 tens place 4's.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, in each group of 10, one 8 in units place. So, 48 times. But wait, the last group is 481-488, which includes 488, so that's another 8 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49 units place 8's.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100 numbers. For example, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since our book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, how many blocks? Let's see: 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers), 100-199: 180-189 (10), 200-299: 280-289 (10), 300-399: 380-389 (10), and 400-488: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and the last block contributes 9. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. So, 49 tens place 8's.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 400-488, the tens place 8's are in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place for that block. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 and one block of 9, so 4*10 + 9 = 49, which matches what I had before. So, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 4 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups of 10 and one partial group (481-488) with 484. Thus, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (including 440-449), each contributing 10 4's: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 4 appears in 400-488, totaling 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 8 appears once every 10 numbers. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full groups and one partial group (481-488) with 488. Thus, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks and one partial block (480-488), contributing 10 each for the first four and 9 for the last. Thus, 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll count how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For every group of 10 numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then a partial group of 8 numbers (481-488). \n\nIn each full group of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. So, 48 groups would give 48 fours and 48 eights. Now, in the partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding these, units place gives us 49 fours and 49 eights. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me check again. \n\nWait, no, 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Then, the partial group from 481 to 488 has units digits 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place total is 48 + 1 = 49 fours and 48 + 1 = 49 eights. So, same count, no difference yet.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in a block of 100. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each block of 100, there's 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place. \n\nNow, how many full blocks of 100 are there in 488? There are 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4 blocks give 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights. \n\nThen, we have the partial block from 401-488. Let's see how many numbers are here: 488-400=88, so 88 numbers. The tens digit in this block goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). Wait, actually, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: tens digit 1, and so on up to 481-490, but since we stop at 488, the tens digits go up to 8 (481-488). \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place from 401-488? Well, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 fours in the tens place. Similarly, when does 8 appear in the tens place? It's in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this partial block.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which is 8, but since we're only going up to 488, the tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the tens place, in the partial block, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). \n\nSo, total in tens place: fours = 4*10 + 10 = 50, eights = 4*10 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. Pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 or not present. Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, 400-488:4. So yes, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, fours in hundreds place: 89, eights: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals for each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\nFours: 49\nEights: 49\n\nTens place:\nFours: 50\nEights: 49\n\nHundreds place:\nFours: 89\nEights: 0\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 fours minus 98 eights, which is 90. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, the last group (481-488) has one four (484) and one eight (488), so total 49 fours and 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours and 10 eights, so 40 each. Then, in the partial hundred (401-488), fours in tens place: 440-449, which is 10 fours. Eights in tens place: 480-488, which is 9 eights. So, total fours in tens place: 40+10=50, eights: 40+9=49. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: fours from 400-488: 89 fours. Eights: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems right. So, the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full groups (480 numbers) and a partial group (481-488).\n   - Full groups: 48 fours, 48 eights.\n   - Partial group: 1 four (484), 1 eight (488).\n   - Total: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 contributes 10 fours and 10 eights.\n   - Four full blocks (1-400): 40 fours, 40 eights.\n   - Partial block (401-488):\n     - Fours: 10 (440-449).\n     - Eights: 9 (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours, 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Fours: 89 (400-488).\n   - Eights: 0 (no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place).\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- Fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- Eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI guess the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers and then do the same for the digit 8. After that, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find out how many more 4's there are.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. I'll go through each digit position one by one.\n\n1. **Units place (ones place):** \n   - For every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484.\n   - Since the book has 488 pages, the number of complete blocks of 10 is 48 (because 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks). Each block contributes 1 four in the units place, so that's 48 fours.\n   - But wait, in the last partial block (from 480 to 488), the units digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 484 is within this range, which is another four. So, total units place fours: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens place, the digit 4 appears in a block of 100 numbers, specifically from 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449.\n   - Each hundred block has 10 fours in the tens place. So, for each hundred, it's 10 fours.\n   - From 1 to 488, we have four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n   - Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so let's see: 1-100: 10 fours, 101-200: 10 fours, 201-300: 10 fours, 301-400: 10 fours, and 401-488: here, the tens digit is 4 from 440-449, which is 10 fours. So, that's five blocks, each contributing 10 fours. But wait, 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8 in the first 40, but wait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 is from 0 to 8 for the 400s. Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 8 only goes up to 488, which is 8 numbers. Wait, no, the tens digit in 401-488 is 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, the 8 in the tens place is from 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, does that mean in the 400s, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, in the 400s, we have 10 fours in the tens place. So, total tens place fours: 4 blocks (1-400) with 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 10 from 401-488, making it 50.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. From 1-100, the tens digit 4 occurs in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 140-149, another 10. 201-300: 240-249, another 10. 301-400: 340-349, another 10. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 fours in the tens place. So, 5*10=50 fours in the tens place.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 4 in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). Each of these contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but wait, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit is 4 from 400 to 488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, hundreds place fours: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188. So, total fours: 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in each position.\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to fours, for every block of 10, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 48 complete blocks (since 488/10=48.8), each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. Then, in the last partial block (480-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so that's another eight (488). So, total units place eights: 48+1=49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For the tens digit, the digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, ..., up to 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, the last block is 480-488.\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 eights in the tens place. From 1-100: 80-89, 10 eights. 101-200: 180-189, another 10. 201-300: 280-289, another 10. 301-400: 380-389, another 10. Then, 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488-480+1=9. So, in the tens place, the 400s block contributes 9 eights instead of 10.\n\nSo, total tens place eights: 4 blocks (1-400) with 10 each, so 4*10=40, plus 9 from 480-488, making it 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights: 0.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48 blocks of 10 (1-480) give 48 fours, plus 484 in the last partial block, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) up to 400 gives 10 fours each, so 4*10=40, plus 440-449 gives another 10, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\nTotal fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 48 blocks of 10 (1-480) give 48 eights, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred block up to 400 gives 10 eights each, so 4*10=40, plus 480-488 gives 9 eights, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for fours again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, that's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in fours, from 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for eights in the tens place, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct, and the answer is 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the number of times the digit 4 appears versus the digit 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit 4:**\n   - **Units place (ones place):** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete decades (1-480), contributing 48 fours. The last partial decade (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred block (e.g., 40-49), 4 appears 10 times. There are 5 such blocks (1-400 and 401-488), contributing 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **Total fours:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit 8:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. 48 complete decades give 48 eights, plus 488 adds 1. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred block, 8 appears 10 times. Four complete blocks (1-400) give 40 eights. The partial block (480-488) gives 9 eights. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No page numbers reach 800, so 0.\n   - **Total eights:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** Subtract the total number of 8's from 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 90 more times than the digit 8.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, and then find the difference between these two counts. Let's start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nI'll consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of ten numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4); from 11-20, it appears once (page 14); and so on. So, how many such groups are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra pages. In each of those 48 groups, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), we have page 484, which also has a 4 in the units place. So, that's one more. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. How many such blocks are there in 488 pages?\n\nWell, each hundred has one such block. So, from 1-100, there's 40-49; from 101-200, there's 140-149; from 201-300, 240-249; and from 301-400, 340-349. Then, from 401-488, the next block would be 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another block. Let me count: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488, so that's correct. So, 50 times 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers, contributing 89 instances of the digit 4.\n\nWait, but actually, the hundreds digit is only 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll need to count how many times 8 appears in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, for every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full groups of ten are there in 488? 48 full groups, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the last partial group is 481-488, which includes page 488, so that's one more 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many such blocks are in 488 pages.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers)\nFrom 101-200: 180-189 (10)\nFrom 201-300: 280-289 (10)\nFrom 301-400: 380-389 (10)\nFrom 401-488: 480-489, but wait, 489 is beyond 488, so only up to 488. So, the block would be 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's only 9 numbers instead of 10.\n\nSo, how many full blocks? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and then 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, for the first four blocks, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. The last block contributes 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) and then 484, so 49.\n- Tens: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449: that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) and 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full blocks contributing 10 each (40) and the last partial block contributing 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again. From 400-488, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, units, tens, hundreds, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, I could use a formula or a more systematic approach for each digit place.\n\nFor units digit:\n- The number of times a digit d appears in the units place up to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if the units digit of N is >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for each digit place, the count can be calculated as follows.\n\nBut maybe I should stick with my initial method since it worked out.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 8's. The last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9), so 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, the last block is 440-449, which is within 488, so that's a full block, contributing 10. So, 5 blocks, 5\u00d710=50.\n\nYes, so my counts seem accurate.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups of ten (1-480) contribute 48, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Five blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.) each contribute 10, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** 400-488 contributes 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 full groups contribute 48, plus one in 488, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** Four full blocks (80-89, etc.) contribute 40, plus nine in 480-488, totaling 49.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nI need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in all these page numbers and how many times the digit 8 appears, then find the difference between those two counts. Let me start by counting the number of 4's first.\n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The only single-digit number with a 4 is page 4. So, that's one 4.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers (10-99): Here, the digits can be in the tens place or the units place. Let me think about how many times 4 appears in the tens place. From 40 to 49, that's 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 occurrences. Now, for the units place, in every set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), so 9 times. Wait, but from 40-49, we've already counted the 4 in the tens place, but the units place 4 in 44 is still a 4, so I think that's okay because we're counting each digit separately. So, 10 (tens place) + 9 (units place) = 19 occurrences of 4 in two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 10-99, the tens digit cycles from 1 to 9, and the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So for each tens digit, the units digit 4 appears once. So, 9 times for the units place. And for the tens digit 4, it's 10 times. So, total 19, yes.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). This might be a bit more involved. Let's break it down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because 488 is the last page. So, for hundreds digit 1, 2, 3, how many times does 4 appear? Well, 4 doesn't appear in the hundreds place for these, so zero. But for hundreds digit 4 (pages 400-488), the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many pages have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the tens place in three-digit numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, for each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), we can calculate how many times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nIn 100-199: The tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences.\n\nIn 200-299: Similarly, 240-249: 10 occurrences.\n\nIn 300-399: 340-349: 10 occurrences.\n\nIn 400-488: The tens digit 4 would be in 440-449. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 400-488. So, that's another 10 occurrences.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, for each hundred block, the units digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred, the units digit 4 appears once every ten pages. So, for each hundred, that's 10 occurrences (e.g., 104, 114, ..., 194 in 100-199). Let's check each hundred:\n\n100-199: Units digit 4 appears 10 times (104, 114, ..., 194).\n\n200-299: Similarly, 10 times.\n\n300-399: 10 times.\n\n400-488: Now, here, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is included. Let me count how many: From 400 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 404, then every 10 pages. The last one before 488 would be 484. So, starting at 404, the next is 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers because 404 is the first and 484 is the ninth. Wait, but wait: 404 is the first, then adding 10 each time: 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. So that's 9 numbers, right? Because 484 is the ninth. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 484 is within the range. So, 9 occurrences in 400-488 for units digit 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred has 10, but in 400-488, it's only 9. Hmm, so let me correct that.\n\nSo, for units digit 4 in three-digit numbers:\n\n100-199: 10 times.\n\n200-299: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 10 times.\n\n400-488: 9 times.\n\nSo total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 400 to 488, how many numbers end with 4? The first is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 numbers. So yes, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units digit 4's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought each hundred has 10, but in 400-488, it's only 9. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total number of 4's in three-digit numbers is hundreds place (89) + tens place (40) + units place (39) = 89 + 40 = 129, plus 39 is 168.\n\nWait, but let me check that addition: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 4's in three-digit numbers.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 168\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in two-digit numbers, I had 19 4's. Let me recount that.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 40-49: 10 numbers, so 10 4's in tens place.\n\nUnits place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 4 appears once. So that's 9 times (since 40-49 is already counted in tens place, but units place 4's in other tens are still separate). Wait, but actually, in 10-19, the units digit 4 is at 14, which is in 10-19. Similarly, in 20-29, it's 24, and so on up to 90-99, which is 94. So, that's 9 times. So, total 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. That seems correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, units place 39. 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. So, 168 in three-digit. Plus single-digit 1, two-digit 19, total 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with single-digit: page 8. So, one 8.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99.\n\nTens place: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place.\n\nUnits place: For each ten (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99), the units digit 8 appears once. So, that's 9 times (since 80-89 is already counted in tens place, but units place 8's in other tens are separate). So, 9 times. So, total 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 8's in two-digit numbers.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488.\n\nHundreds place: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. The hundreds digit is 8 only in 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nTens place: For each hundred block, the tens digit 8 appears in 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, but 480-488 is within 400-488, so let's check each.\n\n100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place.\n\n200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\n300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers, 10 8's.\n\n400-488: 480-488: The tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, 9 occurrences.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: For each hundred block, the units digit 8 appears once every ten pages. So, in each hundred, how many times does 8 appear in the units place?\n\n100-199: 108, 118, ..., 198. That's 10 times.\n\n200-299: 208, 218, ..., 298: 10 times.\n\n300-399: 308, 318, ..., 398: 10 times.\n\n400-488: 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. Wait, let's count these. Starting at 408, then 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, total units place 8's: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit numbers: tens place 39 + units place 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, but wait, 100-199: tens place 10, units place 10: total 20.\n\nSimilarly, 200-299: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n300-399: 10 + 10 = 20.\n\n400-488: tens place 9, units place 9: total 18.\n\nSo, total 20 + 20 + 20 + 18 = 78. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding up all the 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\n\nTwo-digit: 19\n\nThree-digit: 78\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check again:\n\nSingle-digit: 8 \u2192 1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens 10, units 9 \u2192 19.\n\nThree-digit: tens 39, units 39 \u2192 78.\n\nTotal: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts because 90 seems high.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1.\n\nTwo-digit: tens 10, units 9 \u2192 19.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) \u2192 40.\n\nUnits place: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) \u2192 39.\n\nSo, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nAdding single and two-digit: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 1.\n\nTwo-digit: 19.\n\nThree-digit: tens 39, units 39 \u2192 78.\n\nTotal 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a mistake in the three-digit units place for 4's? In 400-488, units digit 4 appears at 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times, right? Because 404 to 484 is 9 numbers, each 10 apart. So, 9 times. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in three-digit units place: 408, 418, ..., 488. That's 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the three-digit tens place for 8's. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in tens place. So, 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think if I overcounted somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's digit by digit, place by place, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, for the three-digit numbers, hundreds place for 4's: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n\nTens place for 4's: in each hundred, 10 times, except the last hundred which is only 9? Wait, no, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 440 to 449 is 10 pages. So, that's 10 4's in the tens place for 400-488. So, maybe I was wrong earlier when I thought units place in 400-488 is 9, but tens place is 10.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit 4 is from 440 to 449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, units digit 4 in 400-488 is from 404, 414, ..., 484, which is 9 numbers because 484 is the last one before 488. So, 9 times.\n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 89, tens place: 40 (10 in each hundred), units place: 39 (10 in each of first three hundreds, 9 in the last). So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in three-digit numbers, hundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: 10 in each of first three hundreds, and 9 in the last, totaling 39.\n\nUnits place: 10 in each of first three hundreds, and 9 in the last, totaling 39.\n\nSo, 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nSo, total 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

Then, I'll subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's to find the difference. Let me start by analyzing each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. For example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every ten numbers. \n\nNow, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. In each complete set, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48, and the same for 8's. But wait, I have those extra 8 pages from 481 to 488. Let me check if any of those have a 4 or 8 in the units place. Pages 484 would have a 4 in the units place, and 488 would have an 8. So, that adds one more 4 and one more 8. Therefore, in the units place, 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, they're equal here.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each (10-19, 20-29, etc.). So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the same for 8 (80-89). \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 instances of 4 in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times per hundred, so 4*10 = 40 instances of 8. \n\nNow, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digit, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear. \n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit cycles as follows: 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears once in 440-449, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's 10 times. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). \n\nWait, let me clarify that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (since 488 is the last page), so 9 times. \n\nSo, in the extra 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nTherefore, total tens digit counts: 4's are 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from extra) = 50, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. \n\nWait, that can't be right because 401-488 is 88 pages, but 401-488 includes 488 - 400 = 88 pages. So, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last one, which may be cut short. Wait, actually, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 8 full tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 481-490), but since we stop at 488, the last ten is only 8 pages (481-488). \n\nSo, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. \n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. So, 401-410 is 10 pages, 411-420 is another 10, and so on until 481-490, but since we stop at 488, that last set is only 8 pages (481-488). So, the tens digits:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 pages)\n- 1: 411-420 (10)\n- 2: 421-430 (10)\n- 3: 431-440 (10)\n- 4: 441-450 (10)\n- 5: 451-460 (10)\n- 6: 461-470 (10)\n- 7: 471-480 (10)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 8*10 + 8 = 88? No, 8*10 is 80, plus 8 is 88, so yes, that adds up. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 times, and the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 times. So, in the extra 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 8 times. \n\nTherefore, total tens digit counts:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from extra) = 50\n- 8's: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 8 (from extra) = 48\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 488 is the last page, so the tens digit 8 in the extra 88 pages is 8 times, but let me confirm. Pages 481-488: the tens digit is 8, and there are 8 pages (481,482,...,488). So, yes, 8 times. So, 488 is included, so 8 pages. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's are 50, 8's are 48. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-488, the hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4. \n\nLet's count how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. \n\nHow about the digit 8 in the hundreds place? Well, from 1-999, the hundreds digit cycles, but in our case, the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book doesn't have 800-899 pages. So, the hundreds digit 8 appears zero times. \n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, plus the extra 8 pages (481-488) where 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 +1=49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Then, in the extra 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, 40 +10=50 for 4's, and 40 +8=48 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 appears 0 times. That makes sense because the book doesn't go beyond 488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place in the extra 88 pages, I had 10 for 4's and 8 for 8's. That seems right because 441-450 is 10 pages, and 481-488 is 8 pages.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488), so that's 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, the calculations seem accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 complete sets (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n   - Units 4's: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49\n   - Units 8's: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (1-400) give 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - Extra 88 pages (401-488):\n     - Tens 4's: 10 (440-449)\n     - Tens 8's: 8 (480-488)\n   - Total Tens 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total Tens 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - 8 appears 0 times.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{91}"
