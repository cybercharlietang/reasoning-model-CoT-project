    "text": " Maybe I should handle each case separately.\n\nLet me think about how many times the digit 4 appears versus the digit 8 in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the difference in counts will come from each digit place. So, I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the units place, then the tens place, and then the hundreds place, and sum them up.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each group, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). In each of those 48 groups, we have one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, that's 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place.\n\nNow, for the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and the digit 8 appears once (488). Therefore, in the units place, the total number of 4's is 48 + 1 = 49, and the total number of 8's is 48 + 1 = 49. So, units place contributes equally to both digits.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, the digit changes every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, how many hundreds do we have in 488 pages?\n\nWell, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). In each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and the same for 8. So, that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights from the tens place in the first 400 pages.\n\nNow, looking at the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, let's see how many times each digit appears in the tens place here. The tens digit cycles through 0-8, but each digit appears 10 times except possibly the last one if the number doesn't complete the cycle.\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Each of these digits appears exactly 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times because we only go up to 488. Wait, no, let me correct that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but each digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly 10 times except for the last digit, which might be less. Wait, no, actually, 401-410 is 10 numbers, 411-420 is another 10, and so on up to 481-490, but since we're only going up to 488, the last set (481-488) is only 8 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times in this range.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 occurs 10 times except for 8, which occurs 8 times because the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 10 times (in 440-449), and digit 8 appears 8 times (in 480-488). Therefore, in the tens place for the last 88 pages, we have 10 fours and 8 eights.\n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 fours and 40 eights, the total in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50 fours and 40 + 8 = 48 eights. So, in the tens place, there are 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant for page numbers 100 and above. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's zero. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, from 200-299 it's 2, and so on up to 400-488, where it's 4.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit 4 appears in the pages 400-488. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's total up the number of 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 = 49 fours, 48 +1 = 49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times because we stop at 488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (480-488). So, adding to the previous, 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +8=48 eights. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 pages, so 89 fours. No 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89 = 188. 8's: 49 +48 +0=97. Difference: 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again for 401-488. So, from 401-488, that's 88 pages. The tens digit cycles 0-8, each appearing 10 times except the last one, which is 8 and appears 8 times because 488 is the end. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 8 times (480-488). So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: For the tens place, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digit cycles 0-8, each digit appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times. So, 0:10, 1:10, 2:10, 3:10, 4:10, 5:10, 6:10, 7:10, 8:8. So, yes, 10 fours and 8 eights. So, the tens place contributes 50 fours and 48 eights.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nSo, adding up, 49+50+89=188 fours, and 49+48+0=97 eights.\n\nDifference: 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place in the 401-488 range. I considered that the units digits go from 1-8 in 481-488, but actually, in 401-488, the units digits cycle through 0-9 for each tens digit. Wait, no, that's not right. Each tens group (like 400-409, 410-419, etc.) has units digits 0-9, so in each of those, the units digits 4 and 8 each appear once per group. So, from 401-488, how many complete tens groups are there? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, which is 8 full tens groups (400-409, 410-419, ..., 470-479) and then 480-488, which is 9 pages.\n\nWait, that might be a different way to count. Let me see: 400-409: 10 pages, 410-419: another 10, up to 470-479: another 10. That's 8 groups, totaling 80 pages. Then, 480-488: 9 pages. So, in the units place for 401-488, each of the 8 complete tens groups (400-409, etc.) contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 8 fours and 8 eights. Then, in the last 9 pages (480-488), the units digits are 0-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, in total, units place in 401-488: 8+1=9 fours and 8+1=9 eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place in 401-488 would have 49 fours and 49 eights, but that was considering all the way from 1 to 488. No, wait, no. I think I confused the overall units place count with the specific range. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, actually, the initial approach was to split the entire range into two parts: 1-400 and 401-488. But in the initial breakdown, I considered the units place for 1-488 as 48 full groups of 10, plus 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in that case, the units place would have 48 fours and 48 eights from the full groups, plus 1 four and 1 eight from the last 8 numbers, totaling 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nBut when I was looking at the tens place in 401-488, I considered that the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 8 times (480-488). That seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach: calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place?\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last partial group.\n\nTotal numbers: 488.\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: 48 (since 48*10=480), with 8 remaining numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each complete group, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. So, for 4 and 8, each appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nIn the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488).\n\nSo, total units place: 48 +1=49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights.\n\nNow, tens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place 10 times per hundred. So, for each hundred, 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-488, there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nIn each of the 4 complete hundreds, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each, so 10 fours and 10 eights per hundred, totaling 4*10=40 fours and 4*10=40 eights.\n\nNow, in 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). Each digit from 0-8 appears 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times because we stop at 488.\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times (480-488).\n\nSo, adding to the previous totals:\n\nTens place: 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +8=48 eights.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1.\n\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2.\n\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4.\n\nSo, digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 numbers (488-400+1=89).\n\nDigit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488.\n\nSo, hundreds place:\n\n- 89 fours.\n- 0 eights.\n\nNow, summing up all digit places:\n\n4's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\n8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:48\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+48=97\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nSo, there are 91 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. For example, in 444, the digit 4 appears three times, but each occurrence is counted in its respective place (units, tens, hundreds). So, that's correctly accounted for.\n\nAnother way to verify: Let's calculate the total number of digits printed. From 1-488, the number of digits can be calculated as:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 9 pages, 1 digit each =9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99:90 pages, 2 digits each=180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488:389 pages, 3 digits each=1,167 digits.\nTotal digits:9+180+1,167=1,356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's:188, total 8's:97. So, the difference is 188-97=91, which seems reasonable given the total digits.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to cross-verify.\n\nUnits place:49 fours,49 eights.\n\nTens place:50 fours,48 eights.\n\nHundreds place:89 fours,0 eights.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit 8. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Break Down the Page Numbers:**\n   - Pages 1-9: Single-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 10-99: Two-digit numbers.\n   - Pages 100-488: Three-digit numbers.\n\n2. **Counting Digits in Each Place:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit (0-9) appears equally in the units place.\n     - Total groups of 10: 48 complete groups (480 pages) + 8 extra pages (481-488).\n     - Each digit appears 48 times in the units place from the complete groups.\n     - In the extra 8 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once.\n     - Total units place: 49 fours, 49 eights.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred.\n     - For 400-488, digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 8 times (480-488).\n     - Total tens place: 50 fours, 48 eights.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Pages 400-488: 89 pages, so 4 appears 89 times.\n     - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - Total hundreds place: 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\n3. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n4. **Difference:**\n   - 188 fours - 97 eights = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The digit 4 is printed 91 more times than the digit 8.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by considering each place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place: I need to count how many times 4 appears in the units digit and how many times 8 appears. For the units digit, every 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once. So, in 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4) and 8 appears once (page 8). But wait, from 1-488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 times (once per group) plus any additional 4's in the remaining 8 numbers. Looking at 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (page 484). So total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 times plus any 8's in the remaining 8 numbers. The last group ends at 488, so 8 appears once in 488. So 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal, both 49 times.\n\nNow moving to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra pages (401-488). In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), same for 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 complete hundreds, 4 times 10 = 40 times for 4's and 4 times 10 = 40 times for 8's. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, 440-449 would have 4 in the tens place, but wait, 401-488: the tens digits go from 0 to 8, so 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 488 is only up to page 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 more 4's. So total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Now, how about 8's in the tens place in the remaining 88 pages? The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages (480, 481,...,488). But actually, 480 is page 480, and 488 is the last page, so that's 9 pages where the tens digit is 8. So, 8's in tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-488, the hundreds digit goes from 1 to 4. So, for 4's in the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 pages (400-488 inclusive), so 89 times. For 8's in the hundreds place, we need to see if any page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times. Therefore, 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0. So, 4's are more by 89 in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference 0\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49 \u2192 difference +1\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0 \u2192 difference +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages, so yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I was calculating the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I considered 440-449 as 10 pages, but 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's correct. And for 8's in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 9 times.\n\nSo, adding up the differences:\n\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\nTotal: 90.\n\nSo, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete groups of 10 in 488 pages: 48.\n   - 4's in units place: 48 + 1 (from 484) = 49.\n   - 8's in units place: 48 + 1 (from 488) = 49.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - Complete hundreds: 4, contributing 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - Remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n     - 4's: 10 times (440-449).\n     - 8's: 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference: +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: Hundreds digit is 0.\n   - Pages 400-488: 4 appears 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in hundreds place.\n   - Difference: +89.\n\n4. **Total Difference:**\n   - Units: 0\n   - Tens: +1\n   - Hundreds: +89\n   - Total: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 pages. Now, I need to find out how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place and how many times 8 appears. \n\nTo calculate this, I can divide the total number of pages by 10. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each full group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and so does the digit 8. So, for the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 48 times. Now, for the extra 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these extra pages, the digit 4 appears once (on page 484), and the digit 8 appears once (on page 488). Therefore, in the units place, 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. So, in 488 pages, how many full hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). \n\nIn each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for 4 full hundreds, 4 times 10 is 40 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages (401-488). The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). \n\nWait, let me think about this. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0. From 411-420, it's 1, and so on, up to 480-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, in this partial hundred, how many times does the digit 4 appear in the tens place? It would be from 440-449, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so yes, that's 10 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but actually, the tens digit is 8 starting at 480, so from 480-488, that's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for each of those, so that's 9 times. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times in the remaining 88 pages. \n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 times, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 + 10 = 50 times, and 8 appears 40 + 9 = 49 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes from 1 (for pages 100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, each hundreds digit appears 100 times except for the last one, which appears 89 times (from 400-488, which is 89 pages). \n\nSo, the digit 4 in the hundreds place appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would only appear if there were pages 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 49 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal for 8: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nNow, subtracting the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 full tens, each contributing 1 to both 4 and 8, and then 8 extra pages, where 4 appeared once (484) and 8 appeared once (488). So, units place: 48 +1 =49 for both, which is correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each full hundred, 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8. So, 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40 each. Then, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, for 4 in the tens place, it's 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+9=49 for 8. That's correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) =98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place, but no, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother way is to count how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times 4 appears: floor(488/10) + (1 if 488%10 >=4 else 0). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, for units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears floor(488/10) times, which is 48 times, and then for the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. So, total units for 4:48+1=49, same for 8:48+1=49.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages. So, for 488 pages, there are 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8. Then, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) have tens digits from 0-8. For each tens digit d, it appears 10 times in a full hundred, but in the partial hundred, it's 9 times if d is less than 8, and 8 times if d is 8? Wait, no, actually, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit d from 0 to 8, how many times does it appear? For d=0: pages 401-410: 10 pages. For d=1:411-420:10. Similarly, up to d=7:471-480:10. Then, d=8:481-488:8 pages. So, in the remaining 88 pages, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450?), wait no, wait. Wait, 440-449 would be in the 440s, which is within 401-488. So, 440-449 is 10 pages, so tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Similarly, tens digit 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total tens for 4:40+10=50, and for 8:40+9=49.\n\nFor hundreds digit:\n\nOnly pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit. So, hundreds digit 1:100-199:100 pages. Hundreds digit 2:200-299:100. Hundreds digit 3:300-399:100. Hundreds digit 4:400-488:89 pages. So, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times, and hundreds digit 8 never appears.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\n4: units 49 + tens 50 + hundreds 89 = 188.\n\n8: units 49 + tens 49 + hundreds 0 = 98.\n\nDifference:188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me think of a smaller example to test.\n\nSuppose the book has 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nPages 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place:4,14:2 times.\n\nTens place:40-49, but since we only go up to 20, tens digit 4 doesn't appear.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 4's:2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place:8,18:2 times.\n\nTens place: none.\n\nHundreds place: none.\n\nTotal 8's:2.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but according to my method, units place: floor(20/10)=2, so 2 for 4 and 8. Then, remaining 0 pages, so no extra. Tens place: full hundreds:0, since 20<100. So, tens digit 4 and 8:0 each. Hundreds:0. So, total 4's:2, 8's:2. Difference:0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: 50 pages.\n\nUnits place:5 full tens (0-49), so 5 times for 4 and 8 in units. Then, 50th page: units digit 0, so no extra. So, units:5 each.\n\nTens place: full hundreds:0, since 50<100. So, tens digit 4 and 8:0 each.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 4's:5, 8's:5. Difference:0.\n\nWait, but in 50 pages, page 40-49 have tens digit 4, so that's 10 times for 4 in tens place. Wait, so my previous method was wrong.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for each full hundred, each digit appears 10 times. But in 50 pages, we don't have a full hundred, so the tens digit from 0-4 appears in the 0-49 pages. So, for 50 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 (1-9) to 4 (40-49). So, digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49:10 times. Similarly, digit 8 never appears in the tens place because we only go up to 49. So, in 50 pages, 4 appears 10 times in tens place, and 0 times in hundreds. Units place:5 times for 4 and 8 each. So, total 4's:5+10=15, 8's:5+0=5. Difference:10.\n\nWait, so my initial method was incorrect because I didn't account for the fact that in the tens place, even within a partial hundred, digits can appear multiple times.\n\nSo, going back to the original problem, I think my method was correct because I considered the partial hundred in the tens place. So, in the original problem, the difference is 90. But let me confirm with another example.\n\nTake a book with 100 pages. How many 4's and 8's?\n\nUnits place:10 times each (4,14,...,84; 8,18,...,88).\n\nTens place:10 times each (40-49 for 4; 80-89 for 8).\n\nHundreds place:0 for both.\n\nTotal 4's:10+10=20.\n\nTotal 8's:10+10=20.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nAnother example: 110 pages.\n\nUnits place:11 times each (4,14,...,94, 104; 8,18,...,98,108).\n\nWait, 110/10=11, so 11 times each.\n\nTens place:10 times each for 40-49 and 80-89 in 1-100, and in 101-110, the tens digit is 0-1, so no additional 4 or 8 in tens place.\n\nHundreds place:0 for both.\n\nSo, 4's:11 (units) +10 (tens) =21.\n\n8's:11 (units) +10 (tens)=21.\n\nDifference:0.\n\nWait, but in 110 pages, the hundreds digit is 1 for 101-110, so 10 times. But that's not relevant for 4 or 8.\n\nWait, another example: 140 pages.\n\nUnits place:14 times each (4,14,...,134; 8,18,...,138).\n\nTens place:10 times each for 40-49 and 80-89 in 1-100, and in 101-140, the tens digits go from 0-3 (101-109:0; 110-119:1; 120-129:2; 130-139:3; 140:4). Wait, so in 101-140, the tens digits go up to 4 (for 140). So, in the tens place, 4 appears once more at 140. So, total tens for 4:10 (from 40-49) +1 (from 140) =11. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, total 4's:14 (units) +11 (tens) =25. 8's:14 (units) +10 (tens) =24. Difference:1.\n\nWait, but according to my initial method, for 140 pages:\n\nUnits:14 each.\n\nTens: each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, 140 pages have 1 full hundred (1-100) and 40 pages (101-140). In the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in 1-100 (40-49), and in 101-140, the tens digit is 0-3 except for 140, which is 4. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 +1=11 times, and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, total 4's:14+11=25, 8's:14+10=24. Difference:1. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to hold. Therefore, going back to the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe using the formula for digit frequency.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nunits = (N // 10) + (1 if N % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + max(0, min(10, N % 100 - d*10 +1)) if d > (N // 100)*10 else (N // 100)*10 +10\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, for the tens place, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\ntens = (N // 100) * 10 + (if the last two digits >= d*10 then (N % 100 - d*10 +1) else 0)\n\nSimilarly, for the hundreds place:\n\nhundreds = (N // 1000) * 100 + (if the last three digits >= d*100 then (N % 1000 - d*100 +1) else 0)\n\nBut since N=488, which is less than 1000, the hundreds place is just (N // 100) if d <= (N // 100), else 0. Wait, no, actually, the hundreds digit is the third digit, so for N=488, the hundreds digit is 4, and it appears from 400-488, which is 89 times. So, for digit 4 in hundreds place:89 times, and for digit 8:0 times.\n\nSo, applying this formula:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nUnits: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 because 488%10=8 >=4, so 49.\n\nTens: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the last two digits are 88. For tens digit 4, the number of times is 10 (from 40-49 in each hundred). But in the last partial hundred, the tens digit goes up to 8, so how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? From 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total tens:40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds:4 (since 488//100=4), and since 4 <=4, it's 4*100=400, but wait, no, the hundreds digit is 4, and it appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, hundreds=89.\n\nTotal for 4:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\nUnits: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 because 488%10=8 >=8, so 49.\n\nTens: floor(488/100)=4, so 4*10=40. Then, the last two digits are 88. For tens digit 8, it appears from 80-89 in each hundred, so 10 times per hundred. In the last partial hundred, the tens digit goes up to 8, so from 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, total tens:40 +9=49.\n\nHundreds: floor(488/1000)=0, since 488<1000, so hundreds=0.\n\nTotal for 8:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that confirms it. So, the answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's separately in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and then compare them.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the digits cycle every 10, 100, or 1000 numbers. Since 488 is less than 1000, I don't have to worry about four-digit numbers. \n\nStarting with the units place: How many times does 4 appear in the units place from 1 to 488? Well, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 480, that's 480 numbers, which would have 48 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: From 1 to 480, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once more. So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nHmm, so in the units place, both 4's and 8's appear 49 times. That means they are equal here. So, the difference in the units place is zero.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens digit.\n\nFor the tens place, 4 appears in the tens digit in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks is 10 numbers, so each block contributes 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. \n\nLet me count how many such blocks exist up to 488. The blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block has 10 numbers, so 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if 440-449 is entirely within 488. Yes, 449 is less than 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place: Similarly, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers instead of 10. So, how does that affect the count?\n\nEach full block (like 80-89) has 10 numbers, contributing 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. So, the first four blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contribute 10, so that's 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for all numbers, right? So, 480, 481, ..., 488: that's 9 numbers (since 488 - 480 + 1 = 9). So, yes, 9 occurrences. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, 4's in the tens place: 50, 8's in the tens place: 49. So, 4's are more by 1 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear here.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears in numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 to 899. But since our book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, 4's in the hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0. So, 4's are more by 89 here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit position.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for 8's in the hundreds place, since the book ends at 488, which is less than 800, so no 8's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. For 4's, I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. But wait, the last block for 4's in the tens place is 440-449, which is entirely within 488, so that's correct. So, 5 blocks \u00d710 = 50.\n\nFor 8's in the tens place, the first four blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 480-488 contributes 9, so total 49. That seems correct.\n\nUnits place: Both 4's and 8's are 49 each, so no difference there.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's: 49 + 50 +89= 188.\n\n8's:49 +49 +0=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me recount the units place for 4's and 8's to make sure.\n\nUnits place for 4's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, 488 \u00f710=48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last partial set from 481-488: numbers 481 to 488, units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So total 48+1=49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same calculation. 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last set where 8 appears once. So total 49. Correct.\n\nSo, units place: 49 each, so no difference.\n\nTens place: 4's: 50, 8's:49, so difference of +1 for 4's.\n\nHundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0, so difference of +89 for 4's.\n\nTotal difference: 1 +89=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly for the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 -400 +1=89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place, 4's: 5 blocks \u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n8's in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d710=40, plus 9 in the last partial block, total 49. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 49 each. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's total:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences. From 481 to 488, 4 appears once. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. From 1 to 480, there are 48 occurrences. From 481 to 488, 8 appears once. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Difference:** 49 - 49 = 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Appears in blocks 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449.

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in the units place, the tens place, and the hundreds place, and do the same for the digit 8. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place: For each complete set of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in every block of ten consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit (like 4 or 8) appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remaining pages.\n\nWait, but 488 is not a multiple of 10, so I have to account for the extra pages beyond the last complete set of ten. Let me think. The total number of pages is 488, so how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of ten and then 8 extra pages (from 481 to 488).\n\nNow, for the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times in each set of ten, so for 48 sets, that would be 48 times. But then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, the digit 4 appears once more in the units place (at 484), and the digit 8 appears once more (at 488). Therefore, the total number of times 4 appears in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times as well. Wait, that can't be right because 488 ends with an 8, so maybe I'm overcounting. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I have 48 complete sets of ten, each digit appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481 to 488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, the digit 4 appears once more (at 484), and 8 appears once more (at 488). So, the total for 4 is 48 + 1 = 49, and for 8, it's also 48 + 1 = 49. So, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, that's interesting.\n\nNext, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in the range 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred.\n\nNow, since the book has 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Therefore, for 4 complete hundreds, each digit appears 4 * 10 = 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let me see: from 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; and so on up to 481-488, where the tens digit is 8. So, each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, except for the last partial set (481-488), which has only 8 pages. Wait, no, actually, each full ten in the remaining 88 pages would have a full set of tens digits. Let me think again.\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. So, how many complete tens are there? 88 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 8 complete tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480), each contributing 10 times for each tens digit from 0 to 7. Then, the last partial set is 481-488, which has 8 pages with tens digit 8. So, for the tens place, the digit 8 appears 8 times in the last partial set.\n\nSo, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 8 times (since there are 8 complete tens blocks in the remaining 88 pages), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, each complete ten (like 401-410) has the tens digit as 0, then 411-420 has 1, up to 471-480, which has 7. So, each of these 8 complete tens contributes 10 times for each tens digit from 0 to 7. Therefore, each digit from 0 to 7 appears 8 * 10 = 80 times? Wait, no, that can't be right because we're only considering the remaining 88 pages after the first 400. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the total count.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place in the entire book.\n\nWait, the total number of pages is 488, so the number of hundreds is 4 (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times for each digit in the tens place.\n\nNow, beyond 400, we have pages 401-488, which is 88 pages. How many times does each digit appear in the tens place here?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Each complete ten (like 401-410) has 10 numbers, so each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so the last ten is 481-488, which is only 8 pages, so the tens digit 8 appears only 8 times here, not 10.\n\nSo, in the range 401-488, the tens digits from 0 to 7 each appear 10 times (since each has a full ten pages), and the tens digit 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, for the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 10 times each in 401-480, and 10 times each in 401-488? Wait, no, because 401-488 includes 401-480 and then 481-488. So, 401-480 is 80 pages, which is 8 complete tens (401-410, 411-420, ..., 471-480). So, each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times each, totaling 8 digits * 10 = 80 times. Then, in 481-488, the tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times. Therefore, in the range 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, and the other digits 0-7 appear 10 times each.\n\nSo, combining this with the earlier 4 hundreds (1-400), each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Now, in 401-488, digits 0-7 appear an additional 10 times each, and digit 8 appears an additional 8 times. So, the total for each digit in the tens place is:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50 times each.\n- For digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48 times.\n- For digits 9: 40 times only, since 481-488 doesn't include any pages where the tens digit is 9.\n\nWait, but 488 is page 488, so the tens digit is 8, not 9. So, yes, digit 9 in the tens place only appears up to page 399, which is in the 300s. So, in 401-488, the tens digit never reaches 9, so digit 9 appears only 40 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to count the number of 4's and 8's. So, in the tens place:\n\n- The digit 4 appears 50 times (since it's in 0-7, which each get 50).\n- The digit 8 appears 48 times (40 from the first 400 pages and 8 more in 481-488).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each hundred block (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a constant hundreds digit. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0 (if we consider it, but page numbers don't have leading zeros, so maybe it's not printed). So, perhaps we should only consider hundreds digits starting from 100.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place:\n\n- Pages 1-99: no hundreds digit printed, so 0 occurrences.\n- Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n- Pages 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages).\n\nWait, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times.\n- 8 appears 0 times because there's no page 800-899 in a 488-page book.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nStarting with 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 50 times.\n- Hundreds place: 89 times.\nTotal for 4: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times.\n- Tens place: 48 times.\n- Hundreds place: 0 times.\nTotal for 8: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 49 + 48 is 97, yes.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and the total number of 8's is 97. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188 - 97 is indeed 91, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let's go through each digit place again for 4 and 8.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4: 48 complete sets of ten (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 1 more in the last partial set (484), so 49.\n- For 8: Similarly, 48 complete sets plus 1 in the last partial set (488), so 49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For 4: In the first 400 pages, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n- For 8: In the first 400 pages, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times in the tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. But earlier, I thought it was 8 pages, but let me check again.\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488. But earlier, I thought it was 8 times. Hmm, that's a mistake. So, let me correct that.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place, 8 appears 40 (from first 400 pages) + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 8 times, but that was incorrect. So, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The range 401-488 includes 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). Each full ten (like 401-410) has 10 numbers, so the tens digit 0 appears 10 times, 1 appears 10 times, ..., up to 7 appears 10 times, and then 8 appears 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 pages). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nTherefore, total for 8 in the tens place is 40 (from first 400 pages) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but that would mean both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the tens place. But earlier, I thought 4 appears 50 times. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, for 4 in the tens place: In the first 400 pages, each hundred contributes 10 times, so 4*10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place: 400 pages contribute 40 times, and 401-488 contributes 9 times, so 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nTherefore, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nWait, so that changes the total counts.\n\nSo, let's recalculate the totals.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, so 4 appears 188 times, and 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8 in the tens place was 48, but now it's 49. So, I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe using a formula for counting digit occurrences.\n\nThe formula for counting how many times a digit 'd' appears from 1 to N can be applied here. But since we're dealing with two digits, 4 and 8, we can compute their counts separately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately and count the number of 4's and 8's in each.\n\nLet me try this approach again.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor any digit d, the number of times it appears in the units place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(N / 10)\nRemaining numbers: N % 10\n\nIf the remaining numbers are >= d, then add 1; else, add 0.\n\nSo, for 4:\n\nUnits place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 >= 4, add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor 8:\n\nUnits place: floor(488 / 10) = 48, and 488 % 10 = 8. Since 8 >= 8, add 1. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSo, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times in the units place.\n\nTens place:\n\nThe number of times a digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to N can be calculated as:\n\nNumber of complete groups of 100: floor((N + 1) / 100)\nRemaining numbers after complete groups: (N + 1) % 100\n\nFor each complete group, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nThen, for the remaining numbers, if the tens digit is >= d, add the appropriate count.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nFor the tens place, the count is:\n\ncount = (number of complete hundreds) * 10\n\nplus, for the remaining part:\n\nif the tens digit in the remaining part is greater than d, add 10\nif it's equal to d, add (remaining % 100 - (d * 10) + 1)\nif it's less, add 0\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula from online sources.\n\nWait, I think the formula is:\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the count can be calculated by:\n\nhigher = N / (position * 10)\ncurrent = (N / position) % 10\nlower = N % position\n\nif current > d: count += (higher + 1) * position\nelif current == d: count += higher * position + lower + 1\nelse: count += higher * position\n\nBut since we're dealing with digits 4 and 8, and position being 1 (units), 10 (tens), 100 (hundreds), let's apply this formula.\n\nLet me test this for the tens place, digit 4.\n\nPosition = 10.\n\nhigher = 488 / (10 * 10) = 488 / 100 = 4 (integer division)\ncurrent = (488 / 10) % 10 = 48 % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > 4, count += (4 + 1) * 10 = 5 * 10 = 50\n\nSo, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher = 488 / 100 = 4\ncurrent = 48 % 10 = 8\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) == 8, count += 4 * 10 + 8 + 1 = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49\n\nSo, 8 appears 49 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place, position = 100.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nhigher = 488 / (100 * 10) = 488 / 1000 = 0\ncurrent = (488 / 100) % 10 = 4 % 10 = 4\nlower = 488 % 100 = 88\n\nSince current (4) == 4, count += 0 * 100 + 88 + 1 = 0 + 88 + 1 = 89\n\nSo, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\nhigher = 488 / 1000 = 0\ncurrent = (488 / 100) % 10 = 4\nlower = 488 % 100 = 88\n\nSince current (4) < 8, count += 0 * 100 = 0\n\nSo, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, summing up:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 91, but now it's 90. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, using the formula, it's 90. So, I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought 8 in the tens place was 48. It's actually 49, leading to a total of 98 for 8's, and 188 for 4's, so the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again, manually.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, each digit appears 48 times in the units place for each set of ten, and in the last 8 pages (481-488), 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nFrom 1-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred block, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). There are 4 hundreds (1-400), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, total 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place:\n\nIn each hundred block, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 * 10 = 40 times. In 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages (480-488), so 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\n8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 complete sets of ten).\n   - In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), '4' appears once (484) and '8' appears once (488).\n   - **Total:**\n     - '4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n     - '8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred block contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n   - For the first 400 pages, each digit appears 40 times (4 hundreds \u00d7 10).\n   - From 401-488:\n     - '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times).\n     - '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **Total:**\n     - '4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n     - '8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Counting '4's and '8's in the Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears in pages 400-488, which is 89 times.\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:**\n     - '4's: 89\n     - '8's: 0\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 times more than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That way, I can count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place and then sum them up.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, in every block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in each of the 48 full blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit is 4 once (484) and 8 once (488). So, adding that, the total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's interesting, so in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check: from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10, so for 488, it's 48 full cycles (each contributing one 4 and one 8) plus the last 8 numbers. So, yes, in those last 8, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So units place: 49 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then the last 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So that's 4*10 = 40 fours and 4*10 = 40 eights. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 again, but only up to 88. So, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, 440-449 would have the tens digit as 4, but wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So that's 10 times. Similarly, 480-488 has the tens digit as 8, but since it's only up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding that to the previous 40, the total tens place fours would be 40 + 10 = 50, and eights would be 40 + 9 = 49. Wait, that's not correct because in the tens place for 401-488, the 4's in the tens place would actually be from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8's would be from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 times. So, yes, that's correct. So, tens place: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, let's move to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so 0 in that place. Pages 100-199 have a hundreds digit of 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, 400-488 have 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. Therefore, hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the difference is 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each place again.\n\nUnits place:\n- 48 full decades: 48 fours, 48 eights.\n- Last 8 pages: 481-488. Units digits are 1-8. So, 4 appears once (484), 8 appears once (488).\nTotal units: 48 + 1 = 49 fours, 48 +1=49 eights. Correct.\n\nTens place:\n- 4 full hundreds: each contributes 10 fours and 10 eights. So, 4*10=40 fours, 4*10=40 eights.\n- Last 88 pages: 401-488.\n   - Tens digit 4: 440-449: 10 fours.\n   - Tens digit 8: 480-488: 9 eights.\nSo, tens place: 40 +10=50 fours, 40 +9=49 eights. Correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- 400-488: 89 fours.\n- 8 never appears in hundreds place. So, 0 eights. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188.\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98.\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in all page numbers from 1 to 488. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that 4 appears 188 times and 8 appears 98 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. I'll need to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and do the same for 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 appears once. Let's see how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 blocks, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, that's 48 times each. Now, for the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, the digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, adding that, the total units digit 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit changes every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Let's see how many hundreds we have. From 1-488, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, but each hundred is 100 pages. So, for each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's look at the tens digit. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each ten pages. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490), but since we only go up to 488, the last tens digit is 8, but only up to 488. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 times (480-488). So, in the remaining 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 9 times. So, total tens digit 4's are 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, 4's are more by 1.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can't be 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the digits. For 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. For 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete sets of 10 in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one 4 and one 8.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, each digit (including 4 and 8) appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 40 each.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For each digit from 0 to 9, each digit appears once every 10 pages. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in every block of 10 pages, 4 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, and then 8 extra pages. So, in the units place, 4 appears 48 times, plus one more in the 484th page, right? Wait, no, because 48*10 is 480, so from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, actually, 4 appears 48 times in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears in the units place how many times? Same logic: 48 times, plus one more in page 488, which is 488, so units digit is 8. So, 48 times plus 1, so 49 times. So, in the units place, 8 appears once more than 4.\n\nWait, no, let me check that again. From 1 to 480, there are 48 blocks of 10, so each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, from 481 to 488, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once more, making it 49 times, and 8 appears once more, making it 49 times as well. Wait, that can't be right because 480 + 8 = 488, so the units digits from 481 to 488 are 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total for units place: 4 appears 48 +1 =49 times, and 8 appears 48 +1=49 times. So, same number in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every block of 100. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), etc., up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for every 100 pages. Now, how many complete hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nSo, for each hundred, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. So, in 4 hundreds, 4 appears 4*10=40 times, and 8 appears 4*10=40 times. Now, let's look at the remaining 88 pages, from 401 to 488. The tens digit here goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? Well, in 401-410, the tens digit is 0, so no. Then 411-420: tens digit is 1, so no. Similarly, 421-430: tens digit 2, no. 431-440: tens digit 3, no. 441-450: tens digit 4. Wait, but 441-450 is only 10 pages, but 488 is beyond that. Wait, no, 488 is 488, so from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, let's see: in 401-410, tens digit 0. 411-420: 1. 421-430:2. 431-440:3. 441-450:4. 451-460:5. 461-470:6. 471-480:7. 481-488:8. So, the tens digit 4 appears only once in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 4 appears 10 times? Wait, no, 441-450 is 10 pages, so the tens digit is 4 for all those pages, so 10 times. But wait, 488 is beyond 480, so 481-488 is only 8 pages, with tens digit 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450). Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times in the last partial hundred. So, total in the tens place: 4 appears 4*10 +10=50 times, and 8 appears 4*10 +8=48 times.\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. Each full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times for 4, and same for 8. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, from 401-488, the tens digit for 4 appears once in 441-450 (10 times), so adding 10, making total for 4 in tens place 50. For 8, in the remaining pages, the tens digit is 8 in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, total for 8 in tens place is 4*10 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. So, 4 is ahead by 2 in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this case because the book has 488 pages. So, from 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (but we don't count those since they're not printed as three digits; page numbers are 1-99, so they're printed as one or two digits). From 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. 200-299: 2. 300-399:3. 400-488:4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. So, 4 is ahead by 89 here.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nUnits place:\n4: 49\n8: 49\nDifference: 0\n\nTens place:\n4:50\n8:48\nDifference: +2 (4 is ahead)\n\nHundreds place:\n4:89\n8:0\nDifference: +89 (4 is ahead)\n\nSo, total difference: 0 +2 +89=91. So, 4 appears 91 more times than 8.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place:\nFrom 1-488, how many 4's in units place? As I thought, 48 full tens (each contributing one 4) and then in 481-488, 4 appears once at 484. So, 48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same 48 full tens, plus 488, which is another 8, so 48+1=49. So, units place: same.\n\nTens place:\nEach full hundred contributes 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds: 4*10=40 for 4, same for 8.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. For 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. For 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4:40+10=50, 8:40+8=48. Difference: +2.\n\nHundreds place:\nFrom 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 times 4. 8 never appears here, so 0.\n\nTotal difference: 89 (hundreds) +2 (tens) +0 (units) =91.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89 times the hundreds digit is 4. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units(49)+tens(50)+hundreds(89)=49+50=99+89=188.\n\nNumber of 8's: units(49)+tens(48)+hundreds(0)=49+48=97.\n\nSo, 188-97=91. So, 4 appears 91 more times than 8.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\nAnswer: $\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears once, and the digit 8 also appears once. So, for example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8). This pattern repeats every ten pages. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Let me calculate that. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of ten, and then 8 more pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete set of ten, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 sets, that's 48 times each for 4 and 8. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in these, 4 appears once (page 484) and 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place within each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place from 40-49, which is 10 times, and similarly, 8 appears in 80-89, 10 times. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. So, that's 4 complete hundreds and a partial hundred from 401-488. \n\nIn each complete hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49) and 8 appears 10 times (80-89). So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times each for 4 and 8 in the tens place. Now, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in the pages 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 times. So, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times. \n\nSo, adding that to the previous 40 each, the total for the tens place would be 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit changes every 100 pages. From 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so it doesn't contribute. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. \n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nAdding up all the places, let's total the 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each set of ten pages (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 complete sets of ten in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n- **Total 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contains ten 4's and ten 8's in the tens place.\n- There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 40 each.\n- The last partial hundred (401-488) adds ten 4's and nine 8's.\n- **Total 4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n- **Total 8's:** 40 + 9 = 49\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times.\n- The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 4's:** 89\n- **Total 8's:** 0\n\n**Total Count:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try to calculate the number of times 4 appears in each place and similarly for 8, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4), and 8 appears once (at 8). This pattern repeats every 10 numbers. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, for the units place, 4 appears 48 times, and 8 appears 48 times. But wait, the last partial set is 481-488. Let me check how many 4's and 8's are in the units place here. 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place of this partial set, 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). Therefore, total units place counts: 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, they are equal.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the digit 4 appears in the tens place at 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, 8 appears in the tens place at 80-89, 10 times. Now, since we have 488 pages, we can think of it as 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Wait, no, 400 to 488 is 89 pages, so maybe 4 hundreds plus 88 pages? Let me think again. Actually, 488 is 400 + 88, so from 1-400, that's 400 pages, and then 401-488 is 88 pages. So, for the tens place in 1-400, each digit from 0-9 appears 4 times in the tens place (since 400/100 = 4). So, 4 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 4*10 = 40 times as well. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. From 401-410, the tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; 421-430, 2; 431-440, 3; 441-450, 4; 451-460, 5; 461-470, 6; 471-480, 7; and 481-488, the tens digit is 8. Wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all of them, but only 81-88, which is 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Looking at 401-488, the tens digit is 4 only in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, from 441-450, that's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place here. Wait, but 450 is included, right? So, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place from 441-450. But wait, 450 is within 401-488, so yes, that's correct. Now, how about 8 in the tens place? From 481-488, the tens digit is 8, and there are 8 numbers, so 8 appears 8 times in the tens place here. So, adding this to the previous counts, the total for the tens place would be: 4 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times. 8 appears 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times. That means 4 has 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. From 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place:\n\nFor 4:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times\n\nFor 8:\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97 times\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each, plus the last 8 numbers (481-488) where both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 40 times. Then, from 401-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times in the tens place (481-488). So, 4's total 50, 8's total 48. Correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188; 49 + 48 + 0 = 97. 188 - 97 = 91. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. But let me just check if I considered all page numbers correctly, especially in the tens and hundreds places.\n\nWait, in the tens place for 401-488, I considered 441-450 as 10 pages where the tens digit is 4. That's correct because 441 to 450 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 481-488 is 8 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that seems right.\n\nIn the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times, which is correct.\n\nYes, I think the calculation is accurate. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n- 488 \u00f7 10 = 48 complete sets, contributing 48 each.\n- The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n- Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 400 pages contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 each.\n- From 401-488:\n  - 441-450 adds 10 4's.\n  - 481-488 adds 8 8's.\n- Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n- Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 400-488 contributes 89 4's.\n- 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n- Total 4's: 89\n- Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one. For each place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete groups of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then an extra 8 numbers (481 to 488). \n\nIn each complete group of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once as well. So, for 48 complete groups, that's 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial group, the digit 4 appears once (484), and the digit 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nTotal 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49\nSo, the difference here is 49 - 49 = 0.\n\nHmm, interesting, so in the units place, 4's and 8's appear the same number of times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). \n\nBut since our book goes up to 488, we need to adjust for that. Let's see how many complete hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then a partial hundred from 401-488.\n\nIn each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the digit 8 appears 10 times as well. So, for 4 complete hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 for each digit.\n\nNow, in the partial hundred from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place here. \n\nFrom 401-409: tens digit is 0\n410-419: tens digit is 1\n420-429: tens digit is 2\n430-439: tens digit is 3\n440-449: tens digit is 4\n450-459: tens digit is 5\n460-469: tens digit is 6\n470-479: tens digit is 7\n480-488: tens digit is 8\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488 is 9 numbers, but wait, 480-488 is actually 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488, so that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nWait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times 8 in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 4*10 (from complete hundreds) + 10 (from partial) = 50\nTotal 8's in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49\nSo, the difference here is 50 - 49 = 1.\n\nHmm, so in the tens place, 4's appear once more than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, for 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so we can ignore that.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1\n200-299: hundreds digit is 2\n300-399: hundreds digit is 3\n400-488: hundreds digit is 4\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8? Since the hundreds digit goes up to 4, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\nDifference here: 89 - 0 = 89\n\nNow, let's sum up the differences from each digit place:\n\nUnits place: 0\nTens place: +1\nHundreds place: +89\n\nTotal difference: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 times, plus once in 488, so 49. So, units place difference is 0.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly 10 for 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.). \n\nBut in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times (440-449), and 8 occurs 9 times (480-488). So, in each of the first four hundreds, 4 and 8 each occur 10 times in the tens place. So, 4*10 = 40 for 4, 4*10 = 40 for 8. Then, in the last partial hundred, 4 occurs 10, 8 occurs 9. So, total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 9 = 49. So, difference is 1.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, hundreds digit is 4, which is 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0 times. So, difference is 89.\n\nSo, adding up the differences: 0 (units) +1 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, correct. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. So, 400-488 is indeed 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89).\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, no, wait, I think I'm mixing up the totals. Wait, actually, I think I should calculate the total number of 4's and total number of 8's separately, then subtract.\n\nWait, let me do that to confirm.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits place: 49\nTens place:50\nHundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89 = 188\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\nTens place:49\nHundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\n\nSo, difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 4's appear 90 times more than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place again to make sure.\n\nUnits place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's in units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, 4 appears once. So, 488 /10=48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484). So, 48 +1=49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: same logic, 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), so 10 per hundred. There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), so 4*10=40 for 4's.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's, total 50.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8 (80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 10 per hundred. 4 full hundreds give 4*10=40.\n\nIn the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), so 9 more 8's, total 40+9=49.\n\nSo, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98\nDifference:188-98=90\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Analyze Each Digit Place Separately:**\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Every 10 numbers, each digit (0-9) appears once in the units place.\n     - For 488 pages, there are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 '4's and 48 '8's.\n     - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more '4' (484) and one more '8' (488).\n     - **Total '4's in units place:** 49\n     - **Total '8's in units place:** 49\n     - **Difference in units place:** 0\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is '4' (e.g., 40-49) and 10 where it's '8' (e.g., 80-89).\n     - For 488 pages, there are 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n     - The last partial hundred (401-488) adds 10 '4's (440-449) and 9 '8's (480-488).\n     - **Total '4's in tens place:** 50\n     - **Total '8's in tens place:** 49\n     - **Difference in tens place:** +1\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - From 400-488, the hundreds digit is '4' for 89 pages.\n     - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n     - **Total '4's in hundreds place:** 89\n     - **Total '8's in hundreds place:** 0\n     - **Difference in hundreds place:** +89\n\n2. **Calculate Total Differences:**\n   - **Units place difference:** 0\n   - **Tens place difference:** +1\n   - **Hundreds place difference:** +89\n   - **Total difference:** 0 + 1 + 89 = 90\n\n**Answer:**\nThere are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the problem into these three parts and calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each part separately. \n\nLet me start by thinking about one-digit page numbers. These are pages 1 through 9. In this range, the digits that appear are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only one 4, which is on page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Only one 8, on page 8. So, in one-digit pages, there's one 4 and one 8. That means the difference here is zero. \n\nNow, moving on to two-digit page numbers, which are pages 10 through 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a ones place. I think I need to consider both places separately for each digit. Let's start with the tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be 1 through 9, and the ones digit can be 0 through 9. \n\nFirst, let's count how many times 4 appears in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 for numbers from 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. Now, in the ones place, the digit 4 appears once every ten numbers, like 14, 24, 34, 44, 54, 64, 74, 84, 94. Wait, but from 10 to 99, that's 9 decades, so 9 times? Wait, no, actually, from 10 to 99, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens digit, there's exactly one 4 in the ones place. Since there are 9 tens digits (1-9), that's 9 times. But wait, in the tens place, we've already counted 44 as having a 4 in the tens place, but in the ones place, we're also counting the 4 in 44. So, 44 is counted twice, which is correct because it has two 4's. So, total 4's in two-digit numbers would be 10 (tens place) + 9 (ones place) = 19. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For the ones place, in each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one 4 in the ones place. There are 9 such sets (10-99), so 9 4's. So, 10 + 9 = 19 4's in two-digit numbers. \n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8 in two-digit numbers. Starting with the tens place: 80-89, which is 10 numbers, so 10 8's. For the ones place, in each set of ten (10-19, 20-29, etc.), there's one 8 in the ones place, so again 9 sets, so 9 8's. So, total 8's in two-digit numbers would be 10 + 9 = 19. \n\nWait, so in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each. So, the difference in two-digit numbers is zero. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are pages 100 through 488. Hmm, okay, so three-digit numbers have hundreds, tens, and ones places. Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place. \n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, pages 100-199 have hundreds digit 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. \n\nLet's start with the hundreds place. How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's. \n\nNow, how about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in three-digit numbers up to 488, the hundreds digit can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, zero 8's from the hundreds place. \n\nNext, let's move to the tens place in three-digit numbers. For the tens digit, each hundred (like 100-199, 200-299, etc.) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is a specific number. For example, in 100-199, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place across 100-199. Similarly for 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is a bit different because it's not a full hundred. Let me handle each hundred separately. \n\nFirst, for hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each across 100-199. So, for each digit 0-9, it appears 10 times in the tens place. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times in the tens place for 100-199. \n\nSimilarly, for hundreds digit 2 (200-299): same thing. The tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times, so 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. \n\nFor hundreds digit 3 (300-399): same again. 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times. \n\nNow, for hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Here, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit cycles from 0-8, and for each, the ones digit goes from 0-9 except for the last one, which stops at 8. So, for the tens digit, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see: in 400-488, the tens digit is 0 for 400-409, 1 for 410-419, ..., up to 8 for 480-488. So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 9 times. \n\nWait, but let me make sure. From 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, and for each tens digit from 0 to 8, there are 10 numbers except for the last one, which is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. \n\nSo, in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: \n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 30 4's and 30 8's. \n\n- For 400-488: 10 4's and 9 8's. \n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40. \n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. For 100-399, each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's, so 3*10=30 each. Then, for 400-488, 10 4's and 9 8's. So, 4's: 30 +10=40, 8's:30 +9=39. That seems right. \n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers. Similarly, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in the ones place for each hundred, except for the last partial hundred (400-488). \n\nFor hundreds digits 1, 2, 3 (100-399), each hundred has 10 numbers for each ones digit. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the ones place, and 8 appears 10 times. Since there are 3 hundreds, that's 3*10=30 4's and 30 8's. \n\nFor the hundreds digit 4 (400-488), the ones digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens digit, except for the last tens digit, which is 8, where it only goes up to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the ones place? Let's see: for each tens digit from 0 to 8, the ones digit 4 appears once. So, that's 9 times (tens digits 0-8), each contributing one 4 in the ones place. Wait, but when the tens digit is 8, the ones digits go up to 8, so 4 is included. So, yes, 9 times. \n\nSimilarly, how many times does 8 appear in the ones place? For each tens digit from 0 to 8, the ones digit 8 appears once, except when the tens digit is 8, where the ones digit only goes up to 8, so 8 appears once there as well. So, that's 9 times. Wait, but wait, 488 is included, so when tens digit is 8, ones digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total 9 times for 8 in the ones place in 400-488. \n\nWait, but let me think again. For each tens digit from 0 to 7, the ones digit goes from 0-9, so 8 appears once in each, so that's 8 times. Then, for tens digit 8, ones digit goes up to 8, so 8 appears once. So, total 9 times. \n\nSo, in the ones place for 400-488: 9 4's and 9 8's. \n\nTherefore, total 4's in ones place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. \n\nTotal 8's in ones place: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39. \n\nWait, that seems a bit off because I thought maybe there would be a difference, but let me check. \n\nWait, for 400-488, in the ones place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times. So, 30 +9=39 each. So, both 4's and 8's in the ones place are 39. \n\nNow, let me sum up the 4's and 8's across all three-digit numbers. \n\nFirst, 4's: \n\n- Hundreds place: 89 (from 400-488) \n\n- Tens place: 40 \n\n- Ones place: 39 \n\nTotal 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. \n\nWait, let me add that again: 89 + 40 is 129, plus 39 is 168. \n\nNow, 8's: \n\n- Hundreds place: 0 \n\n- Tens place: 39 \n\n- Ones place: 39 \n\nTotal 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78. \n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in three-digit numbers, 4's appear 168 times and 8's appear 78 times. \n\nNow, let me sum up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers. \n\nFrom one-digit: 4's=1, 8's=1. \n\nFrom two-digit: 4's=19, 8's=19. \n\nFrom three-digit: 4's=168, 8's=78. \n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. \n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98. \n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. \n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst, one-digit: 1 each, correct. \n\nTwo-digit: 19 each, correct. \n\nThree-digit: \n\n- Hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0. \n\n- Tens place: 4's=40, 8's=39. \n\n- Ones place: 4's=39, 8's=39. \n\nSo, 4's: 89 +40 +39 = 168. \n\n8's: 0 +39 +39=78. \n\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188. \n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98. \n\nDifference: 188-98=90. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. But let me check if I counted the three-digit numbers correctly, especially the hundreds place. \n\nWait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That's correct. \n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers: \n\n- For 100-399: each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3 hundreds *10=30 each. \n\n- For 400-488: 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488). \n\nSo, 30+10=40 for 4's, 30+9=39 for 8's. \n\nIn the ones place for three-digit numbers: \n\n- 100-399: 3*10=30 each. \n\n- 400-488: 9 each. \n\nSo, 30+9=39 each. \n\nSo, 4's: 89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (ones) =168. \n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (ones)=78. \n\nYes, that seems correct. \n\nSo, total 4's:188, 8's:98. Difference:90. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit surprised it's 90. Let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using digit positions and calculating how many times each digit appears in each position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488. \n\nLet me try that approach to cross-verify. \n\nStarting with the units place: \n\nFor each position (units, tens, hundreds), the digits cycle every 10, 100, or 1000 numbers. \n\nBut since we're only going up to 488, let's handle each position separately. \n\nUnits place: \n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? \n\nWell, for each complete set of 10 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. \n\nTotal number of complete sets of 10 in 488 numbers: 488 /10=48 complete sets, with 8 remaining numbers (481-488). \n\nSo, each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. \n\nBut wait, starting from 1, the first number is 1, so the units digits go from 1-9 in the first set, then 0-9 in each subsequent set. Wait, actually, no. Wait, from 1 to 488, the units digits go from 1-9 in the first set (1-9), then 0-9 for each subsequent set of 10. \n\nWait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider from 001 to 488, padding with leading zeros, but that might not be necessary. \n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position. \n\nLet me try this method for each digit position. \n\nStarting with the units place: \n\nTotal numbers:488. \n\nNumber of complete groups of 10: floor(488/10)=48 groups, each contributing one of each digit 0-9 in the units place. \n\nRemaining numbers:488 - 48*10=8 numbers, which are 481-488. \n\nSo, in the units place, digits 1-8 appear once each in the remaining 8 numbers. \n\nSo, total for each digit in units place: \n\n- Digits 0:48 times (from 10,20,...,480). \n\n- Digits 1-9:48 times each (from 1,11,21,...,471,481) plus 1 more for digits 1-8 in the last partial group. \n\nWait, but wait, actually, when considering from 1 to 488, the units digit 0 appears in 10,20,...,480, which is 48 times. \n\nDigits 1-9: in each complete group of 10, they appear once. So, 48 times each. Plus, in the last partial group (481-488), digits 1-8 appear once each. \n\nSo, total for units place: \n\n- 0:48 \n\n- 1-9:48 +1=49 for digits 1-8, and 48 for digits 9. Wait, no, because 488 ends with 8, so the last number is 488, so the units digits go up to 8. So, digits 1-8 appear once more, and 9 doesn't appear in the last partial group. \n\nWait, so digits 1-8:48 +1=49 \n\nDigits 9:48 \n\nWait, but let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 9 appear in the units place? \n\nEvery 10 numbers, like 9,19,29,...,479. That's 48 times (since 479 is the 48th occurrence). Then, in the last partial group, 481-488, 9 doesn't appear. So, 48 times. \n\nSimilarly, digits 1-8:48 +1=49. \n\nSo, units place counts: \n\n- 0:48 \n\n- 1-8:49 each \n\n- 9:48 \n\nWait, but that seems inconsistent. Because from 1 to 488, the number of times each digit appears in the units place should be roughly similar. \n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate how many times each digit appears in each position. \n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated, and since my initial approach gave me 188 4's and 98 8's, which results in a difference of 90, perhaps that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position. \n\nFor example, in the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to N can be calculated as: \n\ncount = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0) \n\nBut wait, that's for digits 0-9, but since we're starting from 1, maybe it's a bit different. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for each digit position. \n\nLet me try to calculate the number of times 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) from 1 to 488. \n\nStarting with units place: \n\nNumber of times 4 appears in units place: \n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:488 //10=48 \n\nIn each group, 4 appears once in the units place. \n\nNow, the remainder is 488 %10=8 \n\nSince the remainder is 8, which is >=4, so we add 1 more. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48*1 +1=49 \n\nWait, but wait, from 1 to 488, the first group is 1-10, where 4 appears once (at 4). Then, each subsequent group of 10 has one 4 in the units place. So, 48 groups, each contributing one 4, plus the remainder. Since 488//10=48, and 488%10=8, which is >=4, so we add 1, making 49. \n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: \n\nNumber of times 8 appears in units place: \n\n488//10=48 \n\nRemainder=8 \n\nSince 8 >=8, we add 1. \n\nSo, 48 +1=49 \n\nWait, so both 4's and 8's appear 49 times in the units place. Hmm, but in my initial calculation, I had 49 4's in units place and 49 8's, but in the three-digit numbers, I had 39 each. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. \n\nWait, no, in my initial approach, I considered three-digit numbers separately, but perhaps this formula is more accurate. \n\nWait, let me check: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? \n\nIt's every 10 numbers:4,14,24,...,474,484. That's 48 times, and then 484 is the last one before 488, so 48 times. But wait, 484 is the 48th occurrence, and then 488 is the next number, which ends with 8, so 484 is the last 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But according to the formula, it's 48 +1=49. Hmm, perhaps the formula is considering 0 as a starting point, so from 0 to 487, it's 488 numbers, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, and the remainder is 8, so 48 + (8 >=4)=48 +1=49. But since we're starting from 1, perhaps the first group (1-10) has one 4, and the rest are 48 groups, but maybe the formula counts 0 as well, so 488 numbers, from 0 to 487, which would have 49 4's in the units place. But since we're starting from 1, perhaps it's 49 as well, because 4 appears once in 4,14,...,484, which is 48 times, plus once more in 484? Wait, no, 484 is the 48th occurrence. Hmm, maybe the formula is correct because it includes 0, but since we're starting from 1, maybe we should subtract the count for 0. \n\nWait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me stick with my initial approach where I separated the numbers into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, and calculated accordingly. \n\nIn my initial approach, for units place in three-digit numbers, I had 39 4's and 39 8's. But according to this formula, it's 49 each, which would mean I missed 10 in the three-digit numbers. Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the fact that in three-digit numbers, the units digit can include more 4's and 8's. \n\nWait, maybe I should try recalculating using the formula for each position. \n\nLet me try to calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in each position (units, tens, hundreds) from 1 to 488. \n\nStarting with 4's: \n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's. \n\nTens place: \n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears in the following ranges: \n\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u219210 numbers \n\n- 200-299:240-249 \u219210 \n\n- 300-399:340-349 \u219210 \n\n- 400-488:440-449 \u219210 \n\nSo, total 4's in tens place:10+10+10+10=40 \n\nUnits place: \n\nIn the units place, 4 appears in every 10 numbers: \n\nFrom 1-488, how many times? \n\nNumber of complete groups of 10:48 \n\nEach group contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. \n\nNow, the last partial group:481-488, which includes 484, so that's one more 4. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place:48 +1=49 \n\nSo, total 4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +49 (units)=178 \n\nWait, but earlier I had 168. Hmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the three-digit numbers earlier. Let me check. \n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I had 4's in hundreds place:89, tens place:40, and units place:39, totaling 168. But using this formula, it's 89+40+49=178. So, which one is correct? \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units place earlier. Let me see: in three-digit numbers, from 100-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? \n\nIn each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. \n\nSo, in 100-199: 10 times (104,114,...,194) \n\nSimilarly, 200-299:10 times \n\n300-399:10 times \n\n400-488: How many times? \n\nFrom 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 times because 484 is included, but 494 would be beyond 488. So, 9 times. \n\nSo, total 4's in units place in three-digit numbers:10+10+10+9=39 \n\nBut according to the formula, it's 49. So, which is correct? \n\nWait, perhaps the formula counts from 1 to 488, including all numbers, so 4's in units place:49. \n\nBut in three-digit numbers, from 100-488, the 4's in units place would be 49 minus the number of 4's in units place from 1-99. \n\nFrom 1-99, how many 4's in units place? \n\nThey are 4,14,24,34,44,54,64,74,84,94 \u219210 numbers. \n\nSo, 4's in units place from 1-99:10 \n\nFrom 100-488:49-10=39 \n\nWhich matches my initial calculation. So, the formula gives 49 in total, which includes 10 from 1-99 and 39 from 100-488. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 4's in units place:39 \n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: \n\nFrom 1-99:8,18,28,38,48,58,68,78,88,98 \u219210 times \n\nFrom 100-488: total 8's in units place from 1-488 is 49 (using formula:488//10=48, remainder 8>=8, so 48+1=49). So, 49 total. \n\nThus, from 100-488:49-10=39 8's in units place. \n\nSo, in three-digit numbers, 8's in units place:39 \n\nThus, in three-digit numbers, 4's:89 (hundreds) +40 (tens) +39 (units)=168 \n\n8's:0 (hundreds) +39 (tens) +39 (units)=78 \n\nWhich matches my initial calculation. \n\nSo, total 4's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit)=188 \n\nTotal 8's:1 (one-digit) +19 (two-digit) +78 (three-digit)=98 \n\nDifference:188-98=90 \n\nSo, the answer should be 90. \n\nWait, but earlier when I used the formula, I thought the units place for 4's was 49, but in three-digit numbers, it's 39, which makes sense because 10 of those 49 are from 1-99. \n\nSo, I think my initial calculation is correct, and the difference is 90. \n\nTherefore, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **One-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once.\n   - 8 appears once.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - 4 appears 19 times.\n   - 8 appears 19 times.\n   - Difference: 0.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - **Units place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n   - Total 4's: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n   - Total 8's: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n   - Difference: 168 - 78 = 90.\n\n**Total counts:**\n- 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n- 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n- Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so I need to consider all three cases: units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each position (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's. \n\nFirst, in the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. For example, 4,14,24,... up to 484. So, how many sets of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, in the last partial set, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4. So, that's 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, in the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488? Well, up to 488, we have four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers, so 4*10=40 times. But wait, in the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 40-49 is within 400-488, so yes, 40-49 is included, so that's another 10. Wait, no, 400-488 includes 400-409, 410-419,...,480-488. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 4 times 10, so 40 times. So, the tens place gives 40 times.\n\nNow, in the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178? Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, but let me check that again.\n\nWait, units: 49, tens: 40, hundreds: 89. So, 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, that seems high, but let's see.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But wait, in the last set, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which is another 8. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times in the units place.\n\nIn the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers every 100. For example, 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many such sets are there in 488? Let's see, in 0-99, 80-89 is one set, that's 10 numbers. Then in 100-199, 180-189, another 10. Similarly, 200-299: 280-289, and 300-399: 380-389. So that's 4 sets, each contributing 10, so 4*10=40 times. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so 480-488 is another 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, does that mean in the tens place, in the 400-488 range, the digit 8 appears 9 times? Wait, no, because 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 times. So, total in tens place is 4 sets of 10, which is 40, plus 9, so 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, let me think again. For 0-99: 80-89, that's 10. 100-199:180-189, another 10. 200-299:280-289, another 10. 300-399:380-389, another 10. That's 4 sets, 40 times. Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, but wait, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480 to 488, which is 9 numbers, so that's correct.\n\nNow, in the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so in the hundreds place, 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units for 8's was 49, same as 4's. But let me confirm that.\n\nWait, for units place, 8's: from 1 to 488, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. But in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding another 8, making it 49 times. So, units place: 49.\n\nTens place: as above, 49 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178, and 8's are 98, so the difference would be 178 - 98 = 80. But let me check again, because that seems a bit high.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's.\n\nUnits place: 49 times.\n\nTens place: 40 times.\n\nHundreds place: 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nUnits place for 8's: 49.\n\nTens place for 8's: 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 98.\n\nSo, difference is 178 - 98 = 80.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the hundreds place for 4's? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times.\n\nWait, but for 8's, in the hundreds place, since 800-899 is beyond 488, so no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but for the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 49 times.\n\nWait, so 4's: 178, 8's:98, so 178-98=80.\n\nBut let me check another way. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the tens place, 4 appears in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 numbers, so 5*10=50 times. Wait, earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but actually, from 0-99:40-49, 100-199:140-149, 200-299:240-249, 300-399:340-349, and 400-488:440-449. So that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier when counting the 4's in the tens place. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, for the tens place, 4's:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers.\n\n- 100-199:140-149 \u219210.\n\n- 200-299:240-249 \u219210.\n\n- 300-399:340-349 \u219210.\n\n- 400-488:440-449 \u219210.\n\nSo, that's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 4 sets, but it's actually 5 sets because 440-449 is within 488. So, 5*10=50.\n\nSo, that changes the count.\n\nSo, units place for 4's:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89= 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\nWait, so that's 188 4's.\n\nNow, for 8's:\n\nUnits place:49.\n\nTens place:49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal 8's:98.\n\nSo, difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178, but now it's 188. Hmm, I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 0-99:40-49 \u219210.\n\n100-199:140-149 \u219210.\n\n200-299:240-249 \u219210.\n\n300-399:340-349 \u219210.\n\n400-488:440-449 \u219210.\n\nThat's 5 sets, so 50.\n\nSo, 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nSo, 4's:188.\n\n8's:98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the 4's in the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488-400+1=89 numbers, so yes, 89 times.\n\nNow, for 8's in the tens place: in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place, 8's: from 0-99:80-89 \u219210, 100-199:180-189\u219210, 200-299:280-289\u219210, 300-399:380-389\u219210, and 400-488:480-488\u21929. So, that's 4 sets of 10, plus 9, totaling 49.\n\nSo, 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nThus, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 4's were 178, but now it's 188. So, I must have made a mistake in the initial count.\n\nWait, let me check units place for 4's again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nEvery 10 numbers, once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48 times. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4, making it 49 times.\n\nSo, units place for 4's:49.\n\nTens place:50.\n\nHundreds place:89.\n\nTotal:49+50+89=188.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nWait, another way to calculate the number of times a digit appears is to consider each digit place separately.\n\nFor units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) + (if the last digit >=4, add 1). Wait, no, actually, it's floor((488 +1)/10) if we're counting how many times a digit appears in the units place. Wait, perhaps a better formula is:\n\nFor units digit: number of times digit d appears is floor((n + 1)/10) if d < last digit, else floor((n +1)/10) +1.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit, the count is (n // 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0). Wait, no, that's for when d is the units digit. Wait, perhaps I should think differently.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the standard digit counting method.\n\nThe formula for the number of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = n // 10 * 1 + min(n % 10, d) if d !=0 else 0.\n\nWait, no, perhaps more accurately, for each digit place, the count is:\n\nhigher = n / (place * 10)\n\ncurrent = (n / place) % 10\n\nlower = n % place\n\nif current > d: count += (higher + 1) * place\n\nelif current == d: count += higher * place + lower + 1\n\nelse: count += higher * place\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, maybe I should just stick to the initial method.\n\nWait, for units digit:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many 4's? Every 10 numbers, one 4 in the units place. So, 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial set, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which is another 4, so total 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: same logic, 49 times.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place: how many times does 4 appear in the tens digit from 1 to 488.\n\nEach time the tens digit cycles, every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 0-99:40-49, 10 times.\n\n100-199:140-149, 10.\n\n200-299:240-249,10.\n\n300-399:340-349,10.\n\n400-488:440-449,10.\n\nWait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10.\n\nSo, total 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 50 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nFrom 0-99:80-89,10.\n\n100-199:180-189,10.\n\n200-299:280-289,10.\n\n300-399:380-389,10.\n\n400-488:480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n\nSo, 4 sets of 10, plus 9, so 49.\n\nFor hundreds place:\n\n4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8's: from 800-899, which is beyond 488, so 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, so the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nFrom 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 488 - 400 +1=89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 times.\n\nAnd for 8's in hundreds place, since 800>488, so 0.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in each set of ten pages. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1 through 0. From 11 to 20, it's 1 through 0 again, and so on. So, in each block of 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place. \n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100 pages. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. \n\nFor the hundreds place, it's a bit different because the book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since page numbers start at 1, the hundreds digit for pages 1-99 is 0, which isn't printed. So, the hundreds digit starts at 1 for page 100. \n\nWait, but page numbers don't have leading zeros, so page 1 is just '1', not '001'. So, when considering the hundreds place, only pages 100-488 have a hundreds digit, and that's 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the hundreds digit 4 will appear from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages, so 89 times. \n\nNow, let me try to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the units place? Well, for every 10 pages, each digit 0-9 appears once. So, total number of units digits is 488. Each digit appears floor(488/10) = 48 times for each digit, but wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so the integer part is 48, but we have an extra 8 pages beyond 480. So, for the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then for pages 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get an extra count. \n\nWait, maybe a better way is to calculate how many complete groups of 10 there are, and then the remaining pages. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place, and then the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so each of these digits gets an additional 1 count. \n\nSo, for the units place:\n- Number of 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Number of 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\nWait, but wait, 481-488 is 8 pages, so units digits 1-8. So, 4 and 8 each get an extra count, so yes, 49 each.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 pages. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). \n\nWait, but actually, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages, so 4 full hundreds and 88 more pages. \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10 = 40 times each digit in the tens place. \n\nNow, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), let's see how the tens digit behaves. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). Let's see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, tens digit is 1; ... up to 481-488, tens digit is 8. \n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is 8 pages, so the tens digit for these is 8. \n\nSo, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), how many times does each tens digit appear? Let's see:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). Each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times except for the last one, which appears only 8 times because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, let me check:\n\nWait, 401-488 is 88 pages. The tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each tens digit from 0 to 7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times because 481-488 is 8 pages. So, for the tens digit in the remaining 88 pages:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place for the remaining 88 pages, each digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 in the tens place appears 4*10 = 40 times in the first 400 pages. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, digits 0-7 get an additional 10 each, and 8 gets an additional 8. So:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50 times each\n- For digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48 times\n- For digit 9: 40 times (since 9 doesn't appear in the remaining 88 pages)\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is 4-8-8, so in the hundreds place, it's 4, tens is 8, units is 8. So, in the tens place beyond 400, we have 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, as I thought, 0-8 in the tens place, with 8 appearing only 8 times.\n\nSo, back to counting 4's and 8's in the tens place:\n\n- Number of 4's in tens place: 50 (since 4 is among 0-7, so 50)\n- Number of 8's in tens place: 48 (since 8 appears only 40 + 8 = 48 times)\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the first 400 pages, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times. Then, in the remaining 88 pages, 0-7 get 10 more each, so 40+10=50, and 8 gets 8 more, so 40+8=48. So, in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 50\n- 8's: 48\n\nWait, but wait, 4 is in 0-7, so it gets 50. 8 is in the remaining 88 pages, so it gets 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place:\n\nAs I thought earlier, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place?\n\n- 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- 4: 89 times (400-488, which is 488-400+1=89 pages)\n- 0: Not printed, as page numbers don't have leading zeros.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Number of 4's: 89\n- Number of 8's: 0 (since 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all)\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 49+50=99, 99+89=188\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 = 97\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages. Then, pages 481-488 have units digits 1-8, so each of these digits gets an extra count. So, 48+1=49 for 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFirst 400 pages: 4 times 10 each digit, so 40 each. Then, in 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. Each digit 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, for 4, which is among 0-7, it gets 40 + 10 = 50. For 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times. Correct.\n\nSo total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, when I considered the remaining 88 pages (401-488), I broke it down as 0-8 in tens digits, with 8 appearing 8 times. But let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 401-488:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, yes, each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in the 441-450 block, so 10 times. So, in the tens place, 4's count is 40 (from first 400 pages) +10=50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the tens place: 40 +8=48. Correct.\n\nUnits place: 48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. Correct.\n\nSo, 4's total: 49+50+89=188\n\n8's total:49+48=97\n\nDifference: 188-97=91\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I calculated the units place, I considered that from 1-488, each digit appears 48 times in the units place, and then 8 more digits from 481-488, which are 1-8, so each of these digits gets an extra count. So, 48+1=49 for 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check: 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, and then 8 extra pages where 4 and 8 are included. So, yes, 49 each.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place for the first 480 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add 1 more count each for digits 1-8.\n   - **4's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **8's:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 times for each digit in the first 400 pages.\n   - Pages 401-488:\n     - Digits 0-7 appear 10 times each.\n     - Digit 8 appears 8 times.\n   - **4's:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **8's:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Digit 4 appears 89 times (pages 400-488).\n   - Digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **4's:** 89\n   - **8's:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\nAnswer: \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count how many times each digit appears.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in the units place, each digit appears once every 10 numbers. Now, how many complete groups of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we're dealing with complete groups, there are 48 complete groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 numbers, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 times plus once more in the 488th page, making it 49 times. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that adds one more 8. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digits go 0 (10 times: 0-9), 1 (10 times: 10-19), up to 9 (10 times: 90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds do we have? The book has 488 pages, so that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for the first 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times each digit in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 times each digit appears in the tens place. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but wait, 488 is the end, so only up to 488). So, from 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). So, the digit 8 appears in the tens place once for 8 pages (481-488). So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 1 time in the remaining 88 pages, and the digit 4 appears once as well (441-450). So, total in the tens place: 4's appear 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 1 (from 441-450) = 41 times. 8's appear 40 (from the first 400 pages) + 1 (from 481-488) = 41 times. Wait, that can't be right because 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 pages, not 10. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me correct that. In the tens place, for each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times. So, in the first 400 pages, each digit in the tens place appears 4 x 10 = 40 times. Now, for the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490), but since we stop at 488, it's only up to 488. So, the tens digits in 401-488 are as follows:\n\n- 0: 401-410 (10 numbers)\n- 1: 411-420 (10 numbers)\n- 2: 421-430 (10 numbers)\n- 3: 431-440 (10 numbers)\n- 4: 441-450 (10 numbers)\n- 5: 451-460 (10 numbers)\n- 6: 461-470 (10 numbers)\n- 7: 471-480 (10 numbers)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 numbers, since 488 is the end)\n\nWait, that's correct. So, for the tens digit, in 401-488, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 8 pages (481-488), so that's 8 times. So, total in the tens place:\n\n- 4's: 40 (from first 400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50 times\n- 8's: 40 (from first 400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48 times\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Because in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. 8's in tens place: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. In the hundreds place, each digit from 1-4 appears 100 times each, because:\n\n- 1-99: hundreds digit is 0, so no contribution.\n- 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, appearing 100 times.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, appearing 100 times.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit is 3, appearing 100 times.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, appearing 89 times (since 488 is the last page, so 400-488 is 89 numbers).\n\nWait, let me check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- 4's: 89 times\n- 8's: 0 times, since 800-899 would be needed, but the book only goes up to 488.\n\nSo, total counts:\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in each place.\n\nFirst, for digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 48 times\n- Tens place: 50 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = let's see, 48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor digit 8:\n\n- Units place: 49 times (from earlier)\n- Tens place: 48 times\n- Hundreds place: 0 times\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place. Earlier, I thought that in the units place, each digit appears 48 times, and then in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once more. So, 48 +1=49 for 8's, and 4 appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but does 488 have an 8 in the units place? Yes, so that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the tens place again. For 4's in the tens place, it's 50 times, as we had 10 in the 401-488 range (441-450) plus 40 from the first 400. And 8's in the tens place are 48 times: 40 from the first 400 and 8 from 481-488.\n\nSo, total 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 97 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 times. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait, when I calculated the hundreds place, I thought 400-488 is 89 numbers, which is correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, 4's total: 48 +50 +89= 187.\n\n8's total:49 +48 +0=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nWait, but let me check again the tens place for 8's. From 401-488, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, that's 8 times. So, in the first 400 pages, each digit in the tens place appears 40 times, so 8's in the tens place:40 +8=48.\n\nSimilarly, in the units place, 8's appear 49 times: 48 from the complete groups and 1 more in 488.\n\nWait, but 488 is the last page, so the units digit is 8, so that adds one more 8, making it 49.\n\nSo, yes, 8's total:49 +48=97.\n\n4's total:48 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=187.\n\nSo, 187 -97=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything in the tens place for 4's. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, 4's in the tens place:40 +10=50.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me just cross-verify. Maybe I should calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately and see if the difference is indeed 90.\n\nTotal 4's:\n\nUnits:48\n\nTens:50\n\nHundreds:89\n\nTotal:48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nUnits:49\n\nTens:48\n\nHundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+48=97.\n\nDifference:187-97=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we determine that '4' appears 187 times and '8' appears 97 times. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should split the problem into these three parts and count the number of 4's and 8's in each part separately. That way, I can add them up at the end to get the total.\n\nLet me start by considering one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, the digits are only 1 through 9, each appearing once. So, how many 4's are there? Well, just one, which is page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Again, just one, which is page 8. So, in the one-digit numbers, the count of 4's and 8's is equal, each being 1.\n\nNext, I need to look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Here, each page number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should count the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place and the units place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. So, when the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80-89, another 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times, and the digit 8 also appears 10 times.\n\nNow, for the units place in two-digit numbers: The units digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each tens digit. So, for each tens group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 will appear once in the units place (like 14, 24, etc.), and the same for 8 (like 18, 28, etc.). Since there are 9 groups (from 10-19 up to 90-99), each digit 4 and 8 will appear 9 times in the units place.\n\nWait, no, actually, let me correct that. Since the two-digit numbers go from 10 to 99, that's 9 tens groups (10-19 up to 90-99). In each group, the units digits go from 0 to 9, so each digit 0-9 appears once in the units place per group. Therefore, for the units place, digit 4 appears 9 times (once in each group) and the same for digit 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nAdding the tens and units places together for two-digit numbers: For 4's, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. For 8's, it's 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4's and 8's appear 19 times each.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that in the tens place, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times, which is correct. And in the units place, each digit appears 9 times (since there are 9 tens groups, each contributing one occurrence in the units place). So, yes, 19 each for 4 and 8 in two-digit numbers.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because each number has hundreds, tens, and units places. Let me break this down by each place.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: In the range 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, let's see how many times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place. That's 89 numbers (from 400 to 488 inclusive). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8's count in the hundreds place is zero.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Here, the tens digit can be from 0 to 9 for each hundreds group. Let's figure out how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFor each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, each hundreds group has 100 numbers, so the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times (for each units digit 0-9). So, for each hundreds group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.).\n\nBut wait, for the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digits go from 0-8, right? Because 489 would be 490, but since we stop at 488, the tens digits go up to 8. So, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears once (440-449), and 8 appears once (480-488, but wait, 488 is the end, so does 480-488 count as a full 10 numbers? Let me check. 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 480 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 group.\n\nWait, no, actually, the tens digit in 400-488 is from 0 to 8. So, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. But for the 400-488 group, the tens digit goes up to 8, so the digit 8 in the tens place appears 9 times (from 480-488), and digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449). Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. But for 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for the 400-488 group.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total for each digit in the tens place across all hundreds groups.\n\nFor digit 4 in the tens place:\n- 100-199: 10 times\n- 200-299: 10 times\n- 300-399: 10 times\n- 400-488: 10 times\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times\n\nWait, but wait, in the 400-488 group, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, total 40 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place:\n- 100-199: 10 times\n- 200-299: 10 times\n- 300-399: 10 times\n- 400-488: 9 times (since 480-488 is 9 numbers)\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 40 times and 8 appears 39 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place in three-digit numbers. The units digit cycles from 0-9 for each combination of hundreds and tens digits. So, for each hundreds group, and for each tens digit, the units digit cycles through 0-9. Therefore, for each hundreds group, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For each hundreds group (100-199, etc.), there are 100 numbers, so each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the units place. So, for each hundreds group, digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place, and digit 8 appears 10 times as well.\n\nBut wait, in the 400-488 group, the units digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the 400-488 group, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each tens group except the last one. Wait, no, actually, 400-488 includes 400-488, which is 89 numbers. Let me see: 400-488 is 89 numbers because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in this group, the units digits go from 0-9 for tens digits 0-8, but for tens digit 8, the units digits only go up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for the tens digits 0-7, each units digit 0-9 appears once, but for tens digit 8, units digits 0-8 appear once.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the units place across all three-digit numbers up to 488.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate for each hundreds group:\n\n1. For 100-199: 100 numbers, so units digit 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n2. For 200-299: same as above, 10 each.\n3. For 300-399: same, 10 each.\n4. For 400-488: 89 numbers. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place here.\n\nIn 400-488, for each tens group (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488), the units digits go from 0-9, except for the last group (480-488) where units digits go up to 8.\n\nSo, for tens digits 0-7 (i.e., 400-479), each has 10 units digits, so 4 appears once per group, and 8 appears once per group. There are 8 such groups (tens digits 0-7), so 8 times each for 4 and 8.\n\nThen, for the last group, 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8. So, in this group, 4 appears once (at 484), and 8 appears once (at 488).\n\nSo, total for 400-488:\n- 4 in units place: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times\n- 8 in units place: 8 (from tens 0-7) + 1 (from tens 8) = 9 times\n\nWait, but wait, in the tens group 480-488, the units digits go from 0-8, so 8 appears at 488, which is once, and 4 appears at 484, which is once. So, yes, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the units place for 400-488.\n\nSo, adding up all hundreds groups:\n\n- 100-199: 10 each\n- 200-299: 10 each\n- 300-399: 10 each\n- 400-488: 9 each\n\nTotal for units place:\n- 4: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n- 8: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, in the units place across all three-digit numbers, 4 and 8 each appear 39 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4: 89 times\n  - 8: 0 times\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4: 40 times\n  - 8: 39 times\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4: 39 times\n  - 8: 39 times\n\nSo, total for three-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n- 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n\nWait, let me check that again. For 4's in hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 times 4 appears in hundreds place. Then, in tens place, 40 times, and in units place, 39 times. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nFor 8's: hundreds place is 0, tens place is 39, units place is 39, so 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with one-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nAdding them all together:\n\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, one-digit numbers: 4 and 8 each once. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 4's in tens place: 10 (40-49), units place: 9 (14,24,...,94). Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 9, but actually, in two-digit numbers, the units digit 4 appears in 14,24,...,94, which is 9 times. Similarly for 8. So, 10 + 9 = 19 each. Correct.\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488). Correct.\n- Tens place: 4 appears 40 times, 8 appears 39 times. Let me verify:\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the tens place. So, 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 each. But wait, earlier I thought it was 10 each for 100-199, etc., so 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30. Then, for 400-488, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, 30 + 10 = 40 for 4's, and 30 + 9 = 39 for 8's. Correct.\n\nUnits place: For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place. So, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 each. For 400-488, 4 appears 9 times and 8 appears 9 times in the units place. So, 30 + 9 = 39 each. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit numbers: 4's = 89 + 40 + 39 = 168, 8's = 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nAdding up all:\n\n4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 1 + 19 = 20; 20 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me check again. For 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times, and 8 appears 9 times. So, adding to the previous 30 each, it's 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: total number of digits printed. Let's see, from 1 to 488.\n\nOne-digit numbers: 1-9, 9 numbers, each with 1 digit: 9 digits.\n\nTwo-digit numbers: 10-99, 90 numbers, each with 2 digits: 180 digits.\n\nThree-digit numbers: 100-488, 389 numbers, each with 3 digits: 1167 digits.\n\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's and 8's:\n\nTotal 4's: 188, total 8's: 98.\n\nSo, 188 + 98 = 286 digits accounted for.\n\nBut 286 is less than 1356, so that's fine. But let me see if 188 and 98 make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it differently. For each digit place, count the number of 4's and 8's.\n\nBut perhaps I should stick with my original calculation. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a lot. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is a significant number, so that's going to skew the count towards 4's. So, 89 in the hundreds place alone is almost as much as the total 8's (78). So, the difference being 90 makes sense because 89 (4's) minus 0 (8's) in hundreds place is 89, and then the rest of the digits add a bit more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nFor units place across all page numbers (1-488):\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place, except possibly the last group if the total number isn't a multiple of 10.\n\nBut 488 is not a multiple of 10, so the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens group up to 480, and then 481-488 adds 8 more units digits.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of complete tens groups: 48 (since 480 is 48 \u00d7 10). Each complete tens group has each digit 0-9 appearing once. So, for 48 complete tens groups, each digit appears 48 times in the units place.\n\nThen, for 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 appear once each, and 9-0 don't appear here.\n\nSo, total for units place:\n\n- For digits 0-8: 48 times each from the complete groups, plus 1 additional time for digits 1-8 from 481-488. So, digits 1-8: 48 + 1 = 49 times each. Digits 9 and 0: 48 times each.\n\nWait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so units digits 1-8 each appear once. So, digits 1-8: 48 + 1 = 49 times each.\n\nSo, in units place, digit 4 appears 49 times, and digit 8 appears 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, in tens place:\n\nEach tens group has 10 numbers, and each digit 0-9 appears once in the tens place per hundreds group.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears in each hundreds group. So, for hundreds groups 1-4 (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), each digit appears in the tens place a certain number of times.\n\nFor 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place (since each group has 100 numbers, so 10 times each digit 0-9).\n\nFor 400-488: the tens digits go from 0-8 (since 488 is the last page). So, for each digit 0-8 in the tens place, how many times do they appear?\n\nFrom 400-488, there are 89 numbers. The tens digits cycle 0-8, with each tens digit appearing 10 times except the last one, which appears 9 times because 488 is the end.\n\nWait, no, actually, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). Each tens digit from 0-7 appears 10 times (e.g., 400-409 is 10 numbers, 410-419 is another 10, etc., up to 470-479). Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nTherefore, in 400-488:\n\n- Tens digits 0-7: each appears 10 times\n- Tens digit 8: appears 9 times\n\nSo, for the tens place across all page numbers:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 3 hundreds groups (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) \u00d7 10 = 30 each, plus in 400-488, 10 each for 0-7: total 40 each.\n- For digit 8: 3 hundreds groups \u00d7 10 = 30, plus in 400-488, 9 times: total 39.\n- For digit 9: only in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: 10 each, so 30 times.\n\nWait, but 400-488 doesn't have a tens digit of 9, so digit 9 in the tens place only appears 30 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place:\n\n- Digit 4: 40 times\n- Digit 8: 39 times\n\nSimilarly, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- Digit 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- Digit 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- Digit 4: 89 times (400-488)\n- Digits 5-9: 0 times\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 4: 89 times\n- Digit 8: 0 times\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for 4 and 8 across all digit places.\n\nFor digit 4:\n\n- Units place: 49 times\n- Tens place: 40 times\n- Hundreds place: 89 times\nTotal: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated 168 for three-digit numbers, but this method gives 178. There's a discrepancy here. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, in the previous method, I considered three-digit numbers separately, but perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me reconcile this.\n\nIn the units place, digit 4 appears 49 times. In the tens place, 40 times. In the hundreds place, 89 times. So, total 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nBut earlier, I had 168 for three-digit numbers, but that was only considering three-digit page numbers. Wait, but in the first method, I split the problem into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, and calculated accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps the second method is more accurate because it's considering all digit places across all page numbers, not just three-digit numbers. Let me see.\n\nWait, in the first method, for three-digit numbers, I had:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 39\nTotal: 168\n\nBut in the second method, considering all page numbers:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 40\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 178\n\nThis suggests that in the first method, I might have undercounted the units place for three-digit numbers. Let me check.\n\nIn the first method, for three-digit numbers, I calculated units place as 39 for 4 and 39 for 8. But according to the second method, digit 4 appears 49 times in the units place across all page numbers. So, perhaps in the first method, I didn't account for the fact that in one-digit and two-digit numbers, 4 and 8 also appear in the units place.\n\nWait, no, in the first method, I did account for all page numbers by splitting into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit. So, in the first method:\n\n- One-digit numbers: 4's in units place: 1\n- Two-digit numbers: 4's in units place: 9\n- Three-digit numbers: 4's in units place: 39\nTotal: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49, which matches the second method.\n\nSimilarly for 8's in units place: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nSo, in the first method, the three-digit numbers contribute 39 to the units place for 4's, and the one-digit and two-digit numbers contribute 1 + 9 = 10, totaling 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the tens place:\n\n- One-digit numbers: no tens place\n- Two-digit numbers: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 for 4's\n- Three-digit numbers: 40 (tens) + 39 (units)\nWait, no, in the first method, for two-digit numbers, the tens place for 4's is 10, and units place is 9, totaling 19. For three-digit numbers, the tens place for 4's is 40, and units place is 39, totaling 79. But in the second method, the tens place for 4's is 40 across all page numbers, which includes both two-digit and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, I think the confusion arises because in the first method, I considered two-digit and three-digit separately, whereas in the second method, I'm considering all page numbers together.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nIn the first method:\n\n- One-digit numbers: 4's: 1 (units)\n- Two-digit numbers: 4's: 19 (10 in tens, 9 in units)\n- Three-digit numbers: 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188\n\nIn the second method:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 40\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178\n\nWait, but these totals don't match. There must be an error in one of the methods.\n\nWait, in the first method, the three-digit numbers' tens place count was 40, which includes the 10 from 400-488 (440-449) and 30 from the other hundreds groups. But in the second method, the tens place for 4's is 40 across all page numbers, which includes two-digit and three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the first method, two-digit numbers contribute 10 to the tens place for 4's, and three-digit numbers contribute 40 - 10 = 30? No, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first method by not considering that the tens place in two-digit numbers is separate from the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the first method, when I split into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I should have considered that the tens place in two-digit numbers is different from the tens place in three-digit numbers.\n\nBut in the second method, I'm considering all page numbers together, so the tens place counts for two-digit and three-digit numbers are both included.\n\nSo, in the first method, the total 4's in the tens place should be the sum of two-digit tens place and three-digit tens place.\n\nIn the first method:\n\n- Two-digit tens place: 10\n- Three-digit tens place: 40\nTotal tens place 4's: 50\n\nSimilarly, units place:\n\n- One-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 9\n- Three-digit: 39\nTotal: 49\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Three-digit: 89\n\nSo, total 4's: 50 (tens) + 49 (units) + 89 (hundreds) = 188, which matches the first method.\n\nIn the second method, I had:\n\n- Tens place: 40\n- Units place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 178\n\nBut this is incorrect because in the second method, I didn't account for the two-digit tens place correctly. Wait, no, in the second method, I considered all tens places, including two-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let me clarify the second method again.\n\nIn the second method, I considered all page numbers from 1-488, and for each digit place (units, tens, hundreds), I calculated the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFor units place:\n\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in complete tens groups (1-480), and then 1-8 appear once more in 481-488. So, units place for 4: 48 + 1 = 49, and same for 8.\n\nFor tens place:\n\n- For digits 0-7: 40 times each (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488)\n- For digit 8: 39 times (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488)\n- For digit 4: 40 times (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in the tens place, for each hundreds group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for three hundreds groups, each digit 0-9 appears 30 times in the tens place. Then, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, with each digit 0-7 appearing 10 times (since 400-409, ..., 470-479 are complete), and digit 8 appearing 9 times (480-488).\n\nTherefore, for the tens place:\n\n- Digits 0-7: 30 (from 100-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 40 each\n- Digit 8: 30 + 9 = 39\n- Digit 9: 30 (from 100-399) only, since 400-488 doesn't have a tens digit of 9.\n\nSo, in the tens place, digit 4 appears 40 times, and digit 8 appears 39 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place:\n\n- Digit 1: 100 times (100-199)\n- Digit 2: 100 times (200-299)\n- Digit 3: 100 times (300-399)\n- Digit 4: 89 times (400-488)\n- Digits 5-9: 0 times\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, digit 4 appears 89 times, and digit 8 appears 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total counts:\n\n- Digit 4:\n  - Units: 49\n  - Tens: 40\n  - Hundreds: 89\n  Total: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178\n\n- Digit 8:\n  - Units: 49\n  - Tens: 39\n  - Hundreds: 0\n  Total: 49 + 39 + 0 = 88\n\nWait, but earlier in the first method, I had 188 4's and 98 8's. Now, in the second method, I have 178 4's and 88 8's. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, let's recalculate using the second method, as it seems more accurate because it's considering all page numbers together.\n\nSo, according to the second method:\n\n- Units place for 4's: 49\n- Tens place for 4's: 40\n- Hundreds place for 4's: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 39\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 39 +"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, from 1 to 488, how many groups of 10 are there? Let me see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers. In each full group, 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place. Each full group of 10 has one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers, 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that's the same as 4's? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so units digits go up to 8, so 8 appears once in the extra numbers. So, yes, 49 each for 4's and 8's in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds are there? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Then, in the last 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? From 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so 488 is included. Wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place. In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Then, in the last 88 pages, 480-488, the tens digit is 8, which is 9 times (480-488 is 9 numbers). Wait, no, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, the tens digit is 8 in all of these, so that's 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, yes, 9 times. So, 4's in tens place: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nNow, onto the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1, 2, 3, or 4 in this book. Let's see, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nUnits place:\n- 4's: 48 full tens +1 =49\n- 8's: 48 +1=49\n\nTens place:\n- 4's: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is 10, total 50\n- 8's: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus 480-488 is 9, total 49\n\nHundreds place:\n- 4's: 400-488 is 89\n- 8's: 0\n\nTotal 4's: 49 +50 +89=188\nTotal 8's:49 +49 +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit position separately: units, tens, and hundreds. For each position, I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times 8 appears, then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10 numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place, so that's 48 times each. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, in this partial block, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, total for units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. So, units place contributes equally, 49 each. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., up to 9 (90-99). So, in each block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete hundreds are there? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488). In each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each complete hundred, both 4 and 8 contribute 10 each. Since there are 4 complete hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 for 4 and 4*10 = 40 for 8.\n\nNow, the partial hundred is 401-488. The tens digit here ranges from 0 to 8. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place. From 401-409, the tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8. From 410-419, the tens digit is 1, so again no. Similarly, 420-429: tens digit 2, no. 430-439: tens digit 3, no. 440-449: tens digit 4, so that's 10 numbers where 4 appears in the tens place. 450-459: tens digit 5, no. 460-469: tens digit 6, no. 470-479: tens digit 7, no. 480-488: tens digit 8, so that's 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers). So, in the tens place for the partial hundred, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for the tens place: 40 (from complete hundreds) + 10 = 50 for 4, and 40 (from complete hundreds) + 9 = 49 for 8. So, the tens place contributes 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. How about 8? Well, the hundreds digit cycles through 1,2,3,4, etc., so 8 would appear in the hundreds place starting from 800, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 89 fours and 0 eights.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nSo, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially in the tens place for the partial hundred. From 401-488, I considered the tens digits. From 440-449, that's 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times. From 480-488, that's 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times. So, that's correct. So, the tens place adds 10 fours and 9 eights, making the totals 50 fours and 49 eights, which is correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 4 appears 89 times there, and 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 fours.\n\nFor 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98 eights.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n   - 488 pages have 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8.\n   - Each complete block contributes 1 each, so 48 \u00d7 1 = 48 for both.\n   - Partial block (481-488) adds 1 each (484 and 488).\n   - Total: 49 each.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each 100 numbers, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - 488 pages have 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 for both 4 and 8.\n   - Partial hundred (401-488): 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 fours and 49 eights.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears 89 times (400-488), while 8 does not appear.\n\nSumming up:\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, maybe I should approach this by looking at each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. That gives us 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. Now, we have 8 extra pages: 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, 488 has 8. So, in these 8 extra pages, there's one 4 (at 484) and one 8 (at 488). Therefore, adding to the units place, we have 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. So, in the units place, both digits appear 49 times each.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), then 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit in the tens place appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. Now, how many full hundreds do we have in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 ones. So, we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages beyond that (401-488). Let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in the tens place.\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Since we have four full hundreds, that's 4 times 10, which is 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place from the four hundreds. Now, let's check the last partial hundred, which is from 401 to 488. The tens digits here go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so the tens digits in this partial hundred are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Each of these digits appears 10 times except for the last one, which only goes up to 88 pages. Wait, actually, from 401 to 488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0 to 8, how many times does each appear?\n\nWell, from 401-410, the tens digit is 0, which is 10 pages. Similarly, 411-420 has tens digit 1, also 10 pages, and so on up to 471-480, which has tens digit 7, 10 pages. Then, 481-488 has tens digit 8, but that's only 8 pages. So, for the tens digit 8 in this partial hundred, it appears 8 times. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). Therefore, in the tens place, the total number of 4's is 40 (from the four full hundreds) plus 10, totaling 50, and the number of 8's is 40 plus 8, totaling 48.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so that's correct. The tens digit 8 occurs in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so that's correct. So, adding to the four hundreds, we have 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 8 = 48 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards, up to page 488. So, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's see how many times each digit appears in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1, which appears 100 times. From 200-299, it's 2, 100 times. From 300-399, it's 3, 100 times. From 400-488, it's 4, which appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, but the problem is about digits 4 and 8, so how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? It's 89 times, from 400 to 488. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all. So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nWait, let me make sure. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each with hundreds digit 4. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place, and 8 doesn't appear at all in the hundreds place because the book doesn't reach 800. So, in the hundreds place, we have 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nNow, let me summarize the counts for each digit in each place:\n\n- Units place:\n  - 4's: 49\n  - 8's: 49\n\n- Tens place:\n  - 4's: 50\n  - 8's: 48\n\n- Hundreds place:\n  - 4's: 89\n  - 8's: 0\n\nNow, let's add these up for each digit.\n\nTotal number of 4's = Units + Tens + Hundreds\n= 49 + 50 + 89\nLet me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's = Units + Tens + Hundreds\n= 49 + 48 + 0\nThat's 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so we subtract 97 from 188.\n\n188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8, so units total is 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens place for 4 occurs 10 times (441-450), and for 8, it's 8 times (481-488). So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, 89 times for 4, and 0 for 8. Correct.\n\nAdding up: 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe I made a mistake with the hundreds place. Let me confirm: from 400 to 488 inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: each digit place is independent, so maybe I can calculate the total number of 4's and 8's separately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of times each digit appears in each position.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use a formula for digit counting. For a given digit d and position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times d appears can be calculated based on higher digits and lower digits.\n\nBut in this case, since the number is 488, which is less than 500, maybe the approach I took is sufficient.\n\nWait, another way: let's calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit position.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nAs before, each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full decades (1-480), each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, from 481-488, we have 484 and 488, so one 4 and one 8. So, total 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-488). Each of these except the last one (8) has 10 numbers. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, adding to the four hundreds, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's. From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's. Similarly, 200-299: 2, 300-399:3, and 400-488:4. So, hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times (400-488 inclusive), and hundreds digit 8 doesn't appear at all because the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nHmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the digits correctly. For example, in the tens place, from 401-488, I counted 10 for 4 and 8 for 8, but let me make sure that's accurate.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit from 0 to 7, there are 10 numbers, and for 8, there are 8 numbers (481-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, correct. For 8, it's in 481-488, which is 8 numbers, correct. So, that part is accurate.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits printed. Each page number from 1 to 488. The total number of digits can be calculated as:\n\n- Pages 1-9: 1 digit each, 9 pages \u2192 9 digits.\n- Pages 10-99: 2 digits each, 90 pages \u2192 180 digits.\n- Pages 100-488: 3 digits each, 389 pages \u2192 1167 digits.\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356 digits.\n\nNow, total number of 4's and 8's should be less than or equal to 1356. Let's see:\n\nTotal 4's: 188\nTotal 8's: 97\nTotal digits accounted for by 4's and 8's: 188 + 97 = 285, which is much less than 1356, so that seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each position again to cross-verify.\n\nUnits place:\n\nAs before, 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, 8 extra pages, contributing one 4 and one 8. So, 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nFour full hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's. Then, from 401-488, 10 4's and 8 8's. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, 40 + 8 = 48 for 8's.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nFrom 400-488, 89 4's. 8's: 0.\n\nSo, 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-400) give 40 each.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.  \n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so the page numbers can be 1-digit, 2-digit, or 3-digit. Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nLet me start by considering each digit place separately. For each place (units, tens, hundreds), I can calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. I know that in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in each complete block, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 4's and 48 8's from the units place. Then, in the partial block (481 to 488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, in this partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, adding those, the total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's are 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's is the same.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. So, in each block of 100, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there? Let's see. The total number of pages is 488, so the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400) and then 88 pages left. So, for the tens place, in each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, for each complete hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nSince there are 4 complete hundreds (1-400), that's 4*10=40 4's and 4*10=40 8's in the tens place from the complete hundreds. Now, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? The tens digit in this range goes from 0 to 8. Let's see:\n\n- From 401-409: tens digit is 0, so no 4 or 8 in the tens place.\n- From 410-419: tens digit is 1, so no.\n- 420-429: tens digit is 2, no.\n- 430-439: tens digit is 3, no.\n- 440-449: tens digit is 4, so here we have 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 more 4's.\n- 450-459: tens digit is 5, no.\n- 460-469: tens digit is 6, no.\n- 470-479: tens digit is 7, no.\n- 480-488: tens digit is 8, so from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 9 more 8's.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 4's (from 440-449) and 9 8's (from 480-488).\n\nSo, adding that to the complete hundreds, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 401-488, in the tens place, 440-449 gives 10 4's, and 480-488 gives 9 8's. So yes, 10 and 9 respectively.\n\nSo, total in tens place: 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, pages 1-99 have 0 in the hundreds place, 100-199 have 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, for the hundreds place, how many times does 4 appear? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, in a 488-page book, the hundreds digit can only be 1,2,3, or 4. It never reaches 8 because 800 is beyond 488. So, the hundreds digit is 8 zero times. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up the 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = let me calculate: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, the last partial block (481-488) has units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 48+1=49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For each complete hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.), 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds, so 4*10=40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449 (10 times) and 8 in 480-488 (9 times). So, 40+10=50 4's, and 40+9=49 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 times. No 8's in hundreds place. So, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n1. **Units Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8.\n   - 48 complete blocks (480 pages) give 48 of each digit.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 and one 8.\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place Analysis:**\n   - Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 complete hundreds (400 pages) give 40 each.\n   - The last 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds Place Analysis:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - No 8's appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89\n   - Total 8's: 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Wait, actually, 488 is a three-digit number, so maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and then do the same for the digit 8, and then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nLet me start by counting the number of 4's.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, in 1-10, it's on page 4; in 11-20, it's on page 14, and so on.\n\nSo, to find out how many times 4 appears in the units place, I can divide the total number of pages by 10 and take the integer part. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so that means there are 48 full blocks of 10 pages, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each of those 48 blocks, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so the digit 4 doesn't appear in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place are 48.\n\nNext, let's count the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times, and so on.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. So that's 4*10=40 times. Now, the next block is 401-500, but since we only go up to 488, we need to check how many times 4 appears in the tens place here. From 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but 488 is less than 490, so the tens digit goes up to 8 in 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, but only 40-49 in each hundred would have a tens digit of 4. Wait, but in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc. So, the tens digit of 4 would occur from 440-449, which is within 401-488. So that's 10 more times. So, total 4's in the tens place would be 4*10 + 10 = 50 times. Wait, but 401-488 is only 88 pages, so from 401-488, the tens digit cycles 0-8, so the 4 in the tens place occurs exactly once in each hundred, but since 488 is less than 500, we still have that 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 more. So total 4's in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 4*10 is 40 from the first four hundreds, and then 10 from 401-488, making it 50. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48+50=98, 98+89=187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so page 488 has a units digit of 8. So that's one more 8. So total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place for 8. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nNow, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. So, units place: 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last 8 pages (481-488) which includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once more, so 48+1=49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8 (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds give 4*10=40. Then, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier for 4's, I had 187. So, the difference would be 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because 187 seems high for 4's.\n\nWait, let me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 times. Because 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and the last 8 pages (481-488) don't include a 4 in units place, so 48.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, 40-49, which is 10 numbers, so 4 hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10. So, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nSo, 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus the last page 488, which has a units digit of 8, so 49.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 8, so 4*10=40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 187, and the number of 8's is 98, so the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. When I was counting the tens place for 4's, I considered 401-488 as contributing 10 more 4's in the tens place because of 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 10 more.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, in the tens place, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more.\n\nSo, yes, 4's: 48 (units) + 50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 187.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nSo, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we count the occurrences of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** 48 times (once every 10 pages, 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8 \u2192 48 full cycles).\n- **Tens place:** 50 times (10 times per hundred, 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus 10 in 440-449).\n- **Hundreds place:** 89 times (400-488 inclusive).\n- **Total 4's:** 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** 49 times (48 full cycles plus 488).\n- **Tens place:** 49 times (10 times per hundred, 4 hundreds contribute 40, plus 9 in 480-488).\n- **Hundreds place:** 0 times.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each of these ranges separately because the number of digits changes, which affects how the digits 4 and 8 appear. \n\nLet me start by considering one-digit page numbers, which are from 1 to 9. In this range, each digit from 1 to 9 appears exactly once. So, how many 4's and 8's are there here? Well, there's one 4 and one 8. So, in this range, the count of 4's is 1 and 8's is 1. So, the difference here is zero.\n\nNext, I need to look at two-digit page numbers, which are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a units place. I think I should calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately. \n\nStarting with the tens place: For two-digit numbers, the tens digit can be from 1 to 9. When the tens digit is 4, the numbers are 40 to 49. That's 10 numbers, so the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Similarly, when the tens digit is 8, the numbers are 80 to 89. That's another 10 numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the units place: In the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once every 10 numbers. So, for each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the same goes for 8. Since there are 9 ten's groups (10-99), each digit 4 and 8 will appear 9 times in the units place. Wait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 groups of 10. So, for each digit, the units place will have 9 occurrences of 4 and 9 occurrences of 8.\n\nSo, combining the tens and units places for two-digit numbers: 4 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. Similarly, 8 appears 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19 times. So, in two-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear 19 times each, making the difference zero again.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers, which are from 100 to 488. This is a bit more complex because we have three places: hundreds, tens, and units. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because the book goes up to 488. So, let's consider each hundred separately.\n\n- For hundreds digit 1 (100-199): The hundreds digit is 1, so it doesn't affect the count of 4 or 8. Now, I need to look at the tens and units places. This is similar to the two-digit case but within each hundred.\n- For hundreds digit 2 (200-299): Same as above.\n- For hundreds digit 3 (300-399): Same.\n- For hundreds digit 4 (400-488): Here, the hundreds digit is 4, so every number from 400 to 488 starts with a 4. So, the hundreds place contributes 89 times for 4 (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But since we're only considering the hundreds digit, each of these 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's right there. \n\nNow, I think I should calculate the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each of the hundreds, tens, and units places separately.\n\nStarting with the hundreds place: As I thought, only the numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 4's. There are no 8's in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nNext, the tens place: For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each hundred group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and similarly for 8 (e.g., 180-189, 280-289, etc.). \n\nBut wait, for the last hundred group, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, and 8 appears in 480-488, but wait, 488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 480,481,...,488). So, I need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, no, actually, 400-488: The tens digit can be 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, the numbers are 10 per cycle except maybe the last one if it's cut short. Let me think. For example, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, but the units digits go from 0 to 9 for each tens digit except when the tens digit is 8, where the units only go up to 8.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place across all three-digit numbers.\n\nSo, for each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred group, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), and 8 appears 10 times as well (180-189, 280-289, etc.). \n\nBut in the last hundred group, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, so for tens digit 8, the units digits only go up to 8, making it 9 numbers instead of 10. So, in the tens place for 400-488, the digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488) instead of 10. \n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The tens digit in 400-488 can be 0-8, each with 10 units digits except when the tens digit is 8, where the units go up to 8. So, for each hundred group except the last one, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. In the last hundred group, 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, for the tens place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds groups 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30 4's and 30 8's.\n- Hundreds group 400-488: 10 4's in the tens place (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488). So, total for tens place: 30 + 10 = 40 4's and 30 + 9 = 39 8's.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears only 9 times, so the total 8's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers would be 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39, while 4's would be 3\u00d710 + 10 = 40.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Let me check again. For each hundred group, the tens digit cycles 0-9, so 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, that's 3 groups \u00d7 10 each = 30 4's and 30 8's in the tens place. Now, for 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, for the tens digit 4, it's 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. For the tens digit 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. So, total in the tens place across all three-digit numbers: 30 + 10 = 40 4's and 30 + 9 = 39 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, for each hundred group, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit. So, in each hundred group, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (once for each ten's group, so 10 per hundred). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times in the units place per hundred group.\n\nBut in the last hundred group, 400-488, the units digit for tens digit 8 only goes up to 8, so the units digit 8 appears 9 times in that group. Wait, no, the units digit is independent of the tens digit. So, in 400-488, for each tens digit, the units digit goes from 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8. So, for units digit 4, in each hundred group, it appears 10 times, except perhaps in the last group. Wait, no, because in 400-488, when the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes up to 8, so 4 would appear once in the units place for 484, right? So, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8, so 484 is included). Wait, no, 484 is within 480-488, so it's included. So, actually, in 400-488, the units digit 4 appears 9 times (once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, so 9 times). Similarly, the units digit 8 appears 9 times in 400-488, because when the tens digit is 8, the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included. Wait, but in other hundred groups, units digit 4 and 8 appear 10 times each.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think that in each hundred group, the units digit cycles 0-9 for each tens digit, so in each hundred group, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the units place. But in the last hundred group, 400-488, the tens digit goes up to 8, and for each tens digit, the units digit goes up to 9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it only goes up to 8. So, in the units place, for 400-488, the digit 4 appears 9 times (once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, so 9 times), and the digit 8 appears 9 times as well (once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, units go up to 8, so 488 is included). Wait, but in other hundred groups, like 100-199, each units digit appears 10 times for each tens digit, so 10 times per hundred group. So, for 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place. For 400-488, it's 9 4's and 9 8's in the units place.\n\nWait, let me think again. For each hundred group, the units digit cycles through 0-9 for each tens digit. So, in 100-199, for each tens digit (0-9), the units digit goes from 0-9, so 4 appears 10 times (once for each tens digit) in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears 10 times. Same for 200-299 and 300-399. Now, in 400-488, the tens digits go from 0-8, and for each of these, the units digit goes from 0-9 except when the tens digit is 8, where it goes up to 8. So, for the units digit 4, in 400-488, it appears once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, which is 9 times. Similarly, the units digit 8 appears once for each tens digit from 0 to 8, but when the tens digit is 8, the units go up to 8, so 488 is included, making it 9 times as well.\n\nSo, total units digit counts:\n\n- 4's: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 in 400-488, totaling 39.\n- 8's: 3 groups \u00d7 10 = 30, plus 9 in 400-488, totaling 39.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in 400-488, the units digit 8 appears 9 times, but in the other groups, it's 10 times each, so 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39. Similarly for 4's. So, units place contributes 39 4's and 39 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. For each hundred group except the last, units digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times. In the last group, 400-488, units digit 4 appears 9 times (once for each tens digit 0-8), and units digit 8 appears 9 times as well (once for each tens digit 0-8, with 488 included). So, total units digit 4's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39, and same for 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n- Tens place: 40 4's and 39 8's.\n- Units place: 39 4's and 39 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Hundreds place: 89 4's (from 400-488), and 0 8's because no page number has 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nTens place: 40 4's and 39 8's.\n\nUnits place: 39 4's and 39 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Now, let's sum up all the digits from one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.\n\nFrom one-digit:\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nFrom two-digit:\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nFrom three-digit:\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations, especially in the three-digit numbers.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, I had 89 4's, which is correct because from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, I calculated 40 4's and 39 8's. Let me verify that.\n\nFor three-digit numbers:\n\n- Tens place for 4's: In each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each, so 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449). So, total 40 4's in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\n- Tens place for 8's: In each of the first three hundreds, 10 times each, so 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total 39 8's in the tens place. Correct.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- For 4's: In each of the first three hundreds, 10 times each, so 3\u00d710=30. In 400-488, 9 times. So, total 39 4's. Correct.\n\n- For 8's: Similarly, 3\u00d710=30 in the first three hundreds, and 9 in 400-488, totaling 39. Correct.\n\nSo, three-digit numbers:\n\n4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168.\n\n8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nAdding the one-digit and two-digit:\n\n4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that might be correct, but let me cross-verify by another method.\n\nAnother approach: For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds), calculate how many 4's and 8's appear.\n\nUnits digit:\n\n- From 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? It's 488 divided by 10, which is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 4, so 48\u00d71=48. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so actually, it's 48 full cycles (480 numbers) plus 8 more numbers (481-488). In the units place, 4 appears once in each cycle, so 48 times, plus in the last 8 numbers, 484 would have a units digit 4, so total 49 times. Wait, no, 488 is 48\u00d710 + 8, so the units digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 48 full times, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 is included, which is another 4, so total 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: 488 divided by 10 is 48 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 48 times, and in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 488 has a units digit 8, so that's one more, making it 49 times.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier calculation where in three-digit numbers, units digit 4's were 39 and 8's were 39, plus in one-digit and two-digit, units digit 4's and 8's were 1 each. So, total units digit 4's: 39 (three-digit) + 1 (one-digit) + 9 (two-digit) = 49. Similarly, 8's: 39 + 1 + 9 = 49. So, that matches. So, units digit: 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens digit:\n\nSimilarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit appears 10 times in each cycle. So, in 488 numbers, how many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, etc.) up to 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488.\n\nWait, no, 488 is 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. So, for the tens digit, in each hundred, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 4 and 8 each appear 10 times in the tens place. So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4\u00d710=40 4's and 40 8's. Now, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, for each tens digit, the 4's and 8's would appear as follows:\n\n- For tens digit 4: 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's.\n- For tens digit 8: 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's.\n\nSo, in the partial hundred, 4's: 10, 8's: 9.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier I had in three-digit numbers, tens digit 4's: 40 and 8's: 39. Plus, in one-digit and two-digit numbers, the tens digit doesn't exist, so only the three-digit numbers contribute. Wait, but according to this method, total tens digit 4's: 50 and 8's: 49. But earlier, I had in three-digit numbers, tens digit 4's: 40 and 8's: 39. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, in the three-digit numbers, I considered each hundred group separately, but perhaps I should include the two-digit numbers as well. Wait, no, because in two-digit numbers, the tens digit is part of the two-digit number, not the three-digit. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the two approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps I should separate the calculation for the tens digit across all page numbers, including one-digit and two-digit.\n\nWait, in one-digit numbers, the tens digit doesn't exist, so only from 10 onwards, the tens digit exists. So, for the tens digit, from 10 to 488.\n\nIn the tens digit:\n\n- Each hundred group (10-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) contributes to the tens digit.\n\nWait, but 10-99 is a two-digit number, so the tens digit is from 1 to 9, each appearing 10 times (e.g., 10-19: tens digit 1 appears 10 times, etc.). So, in 10-99, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49), and 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n\nThen, in each three-digit hundred group (100-199, etc.), as before, the tens digit 4 and 8 each appear 10 times per hundred.\n\nIn the last group, 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's:\n\n- 10 (from 10-99) + 3\u00d710 (from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) + 10 (from 400-488) = 10 + 30 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal tens digit 8's:\n\n- 10 (from 10-99) + 3\u00d710 (from three-digit groups) + 9 (from 400-488) = 10 + 30 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total tens digit 4's: 50, 8's: 49.\n\nSimilarly, units digit:\n\nAs calculated before, units digit 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\nNow, hundreds digit:\n\nOnly from 100 onwards, so:\n\n- 100-199: hundreds digit 1, no 4's or 8's.\n- 200-299: hundreds digit 2, same.\n- 300-399: hundreds digit 3, same.\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, so 89 times (488 - 400 + 1 = 89).\n\nSo, hundreds digit 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, summing up all digit positions:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit, I had the same result. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's any overlap or mistake in counting. For example, in the three-digit numbers, when I counted the hundreds place as 89 4's, that's correct because 400-488 is 89 numbers. Then, in the tens place, 40 4's and 39 8's, and in the units place, 39 4's and 39 8's. So, 89 + 40 + 39 = 168 4's, and 0 + 39 + 39 = 78 8's. Then, adding the one-digit and two-digit counts: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188 4's, and 1 + 19 + 78 = 98 8's. So, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **One-Digit Page Numbers (1-9):**\n   - Each digit from 1 to 9 appears once.\n   - Count of 4's: 1\n   - Count of 8's: 1\n   - Difference: 0\n\n2. **Two-Digit Page Numbers (10-99):**\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - 4 appears 10 times (40-49)\n     - 8 appears 10 times (80-89)\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each digit appears 9 times (since there are 9 groups of 10)\n     - 4 appears 9 times\n     - 8 appears 9 times\n   - Total for two-digit numbers:\n     - 4's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n     - 8's: 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19\n   - Difference: 0\n\n3. **Three-Digit Page Numbers (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - 4 appears 89 times (400-488)\n     - 8 does not appear\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n     - 400-488 contributes 10 4's and 9 8's.\n     - Total 4's: 3\u00d710 + 10 = 40\n     - Total 8's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each hundred group contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n     - 400-488 contributes 9 4's and 9 8's.\n     - Total 4's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n     - Total 8's: 3\u00d710 + 9 = 39\n   - Total for three-digit numbers:\n     - 4's: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 168\n     - 8's: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78\n   - Difference: 168 - 78 = 90\n\n4. **Total Counts Across All Page Numbers:**\n   - 4's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188\n   - 8's: 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each place and then do the same for 8, and then subtract the two totals to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's look at the units place first. In the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (since 488 = 48*10 + 8). So, in each complete block, there's one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block, which is 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once in this partial block as well (at 484). So total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If I have 488 pages, the last page is 488, so the last partial block is from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So yes, 4 appears once here. So units place for 4 is 49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 10 (for 10-19), and so on. The digit 4 appears in the tens place in the range 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in each subsequent hundred, like 140-149, 240-249, etc., the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. How many such hundreds are there up to 488?\n\nWell, the hundreds go from 0 (for 1-99) to 4 (for 400-488). So, for each hundred except the last one, which is only up to 488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Let's see:\n\n- 1-99: The tens digit is 4 in 40-49, so 10 times.\n- 100-199: Similarly, 140-149, 10 times.\n- 200-299: 240-249, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n- 400-488: Now, here, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but wait, does 449 exist? Wait, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488, so yes, 10 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 includes 400 to 488, so the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. So, each hundred has 10 times the tens digit 4, and there are 5 hundreds in 488 (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488). Wait, but 400-488 is only 88 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's fine. So, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 5 times 10, which is 50. Wait, but wait, let me count them:\n\n- 1-99: 40-49: 10\n- 100-199: 140-149: 10\n- 200-299: 240-249: 10\n- 300-399: 340-349: 10\n- 400-488: 440-449: 10\n\nThat's 5 sets, each contributing 10, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). But the hundreds digit is 4 for all of these, so that's 89 times. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nSo, total 4's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4, in the units place, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? As before, 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers. So, in each complete block, 8 appears once in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here as well (at 488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but wait, 488 is the last page, so the partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. So, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, yes, 8 appears once here. So, units place for 8 is 49.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The digit 8 appears in the tens place in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each hundred block, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. Let's see how many such blocks we have up to 488.\n\n- 1-99: 80-89: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 100-199: 180-189: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 200-299: 280-289: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 300-399: 380-389: 10 numbers, so 10 8's.\n- 400-488: Now, here, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but our book ends at 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, so does that mean the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here? Because 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 480 is included, right? So, 480,481,...,488: that's 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit 8 appears here.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n- 1-99: 10\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nSo, total 8's in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9 = 49.\n\nWait, that's 49. Hmm, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, and in the last partial hundred, it's 9 times because we only go up to 488. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's would be units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. That seems right.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, total 4's are 188, total 8's are 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete blocks (1-480) with 10 numbers each, so 48 4's, plus 484 in the partial block, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 10 per hundred, 5 hundreds, so 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete blocks, 48 8's, plus 488, so 49. Correct.\n- Tens place: 10 in each of the first four hundreds, and 9 in the last partial hundred, total 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never goes beyond 4, so 8's in hundreds place are indeed 0. That's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's in the 400-488 range. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488. So, 9 times. So, 10 in each of the first four hundreds, and 9 in the last, so 49 total. Correct.\n\nWait, but wait, when I count the hundreds for 4's, I considered 400-488 as a separate case, giving 89 4's in the hundreds place. Let me confirm that 400-488 is 89 numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is given by:\n\nfloor(n / 10) + (1 if (n % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, actually, that's for digits 0-9. Wait, but in our case, for units digit, from 1 to n, the number of times digit d appears is:\n\nIf d != 0: floor((n + 1) / 10) * 1 + (1 if (n + 1) % 10 > d else 0)\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Let me use the formula correctly.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + min(1, max(0, n % 10 - d + 1)) if d != 0 else (n // 10)\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to just calculate as I did before.\n\nBut since I already did the counting manually and got 49 for both 4 and 8 in the units place, I think that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens digit:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in the tens place from 1 to n is:\n\ncount = (n // 100) * 10 + (min(10, max(0, n % 100 - (d * 10) + 1)) if (n // 10) % 10 >= d else 0)\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. I think my manual counting is correct.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 49 times.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted correctly for the tens digit in the 400-488 range for 8's. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place there. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, another way: Let's think about how many times 8 appears in the tens place in the entire book.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each 100-number block, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, except possibly the last block if it's incomplete.\n\nSo, up to 488, how many complete hundreds do we have? 4 complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place. Then, the last block is 400-488, which is 89 numbers. In this block, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, total 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and the last hundred (400-488) also contributes 10 4's in 440-449. So, 5*10=50. Correct.\n\nI think my counts are accurate. So, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just check with a smaller number to see if my method works. Suppose we have a book with 20 pages. How many 4's and 8's would there be?\n\nPage numbers 1-20.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\nUnits place: 4,14: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 40-49, but we only go up to 20, so 0 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 2.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\nUnits place: 8,18: 2 times.\n\nTens place: 80-89, but we only go up to 20, so 0 times.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 2.\n\nDifference: 2-2=0. Hmm, correct because in 1-20, 4's and 8's appear equally in units place, and no 4's or 8's in tens place.\n\nAnother test: 50 pages.\n\n4's:\n\nUnits: 4,14,24,34,44: 5 times.\n\nTens: 40-49: 10 times.\n\nHundreds: 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 15.\n\n8's:\n\nUnits:8,18,28,38,48:5 times.\n\nTens: 40-49: no, wait, 80-89 would be in 80-89, but 50 is the limit, so 0 times.\n\nHundreds:0.\n\nTotal 8's:5.\n\nDifference:15-5=10.\n\nWait, but let me count manually:\n\nPages 1-50:\n\n4's: 4,14,24,34,44 (units:5), and 40-49 (tens:10). So, 15.\n\n8's:8,18,28,38,48 (units:5), and no 80-89 since 50 is the limit. So, 5.\n\nDifference:10. Correct.\n\nSo, my method seems to work. So, in the original problem, the difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that in the hundreds place for 4's, I didn't overcount. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place for 4's, in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Correct.\n\nIn the units place for 4's, 49 times. Correct.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's, units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - From 1 to 488, every 10 numbers contribute one '4' in the units place.\n     - There are 48 complete blocks of 10, contributing 48 '4's.\n     - In the partial block (481-488), '4' appears once (484).\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In each 100-number block, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n     - There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488).\n     - Each contributes 10 '4's, except the last block, which also contributes 10 (440-449).\n     - Total in tens place: 5 * 10 = 50.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - From 400-488, every page number has '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - This is 89 numbers (488 - 400 + 1).\n     - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n   \n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** \n     - Similar to '4', every 10 numbers contribute one '8'.\n     - 48 complete blocks contribute 48 '8's.\n     - In the partial block (481-488), '8' appears once (488).\n     - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   \n   - **Tens Place:** \n     - In each 100-number block, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n     - There are 4 complete blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 '8's.\n     - In the partial block (400-488), '8' appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n     - Total in tens place: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49.\n   \n   - **Hundreds Place:** \n     - Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches '8'.\n     - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n   \n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That might make it easier to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally often in a complete set of numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, I need to check if 488 is a multiple of 10. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so it's not a complete set. So, the number of times each digit appears in the units place might not be exactly the same. Wait, actually, for each block of 10 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48 complete blocks, and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then the digits from 1 to 8 appear once more in the extra 8 numbers. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so the first block is 1-10, then 11-20, etc. So, actually, the first block (1-10) has digits 1-0 in the units place, so 0 appears once, and 1-9 each appear once. Then each subsequent block of 10 has each digit 0-9 appearing once in the units place. So, for 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Let me calculate 488 divided by 10, which is 48.8, so 48 complete blocks (1-480) and then 8 extra pages (481-488). \n\nIn each complete block of 10, the digit 4 appears once in the units place, and the digit 8 appears once. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, in the units place, 4 appears once more, and 8 appears once more. So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 times for 4, and 48 + 1 = 49 times for 8. Wait, but actually, page 488 is included, so the units digits go up to 8, so yes, 4 and 8 each appear once more. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, then 1 for 10-19, up to 9 for 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. Now, since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, for 400 pages, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40 times for 4, and 4 * 10 = 40 times for 8. Now, the remaining 88 pages (401-488) need to be considered. Let's see, 401-488 is 88 numbers. The tens digit in this range goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each ten, how many times does each digit appear?\n\nFrom 401-410: tens digit is 0, so 0 appears 10 times (but we're only going up to 410, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times). But wait, 401-410 is 10 numbers, so the tens digit is 0 for all 10. Similarly, 411-420: tens digit is 1, 10 times. Continuing up to 480-488: tens digit is 8, but only 9 times because 488 is the last page, so from 480-488 is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so it's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit for 480-488 is 8, appearing 9 times.\n\nWait, but 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's check: 488 - 400 = 88, so 401 to 488 is 88 numbers. So, how many complete tens are there? From 401-410: 10 numbers, tens digit 0. 411-420: 10, tens digit 1. 421-430: 10, tens digit 2. 431-440: 10, tens digit 3. 441-450: 10, tens digit 4. 451-460: 10, tens digit 5. 461-470: 10, tens digit 6. 471-480: 10, tens digit 7. Then, 481-488: 8 numbers, tens digit 8. So, that's 8 complete tens (401-410 up to 471-480) each contributing 10 times, and then 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times. Wait, but 481-488 is 8 numbers: 481,482,...,488, so 8 numbers, so tens digit is 8 for each, so 8 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 480-488 is 9 numbers, but actually, 480 is included in 471-480, which is 10 numbers: 471-480. So, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8, appearing 8 times. So, in the tens place for the last 88 pages, how many times does 4 and 8 appear?\n\nLooking at the tens digits:\n\n- 401-410: 0\n- 411-420:1\n- 421-430:2\n- 431-440:3\n- 441-450:4 (10 times)\n- 451-460:5\n- 461-470:6\n- 471-480:7 (10 times)\n- 481-488:8 (8 times)\n\nSo, in the tens place for 401-488:\n\n- Digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450)\n- Digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place for the entire book (1-488):\n\n- Digit 4: 400 pages contribute 4*10=40 times, plus 401-488 contributes 10 times, so total 50 times.\n- Digit 8: 400 pages contribute 4*10=40 times, plus 401-488 contributes 8 times, so total 48 times.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 400 pages contribute 4*10=40 times for both 4 and 8 in the tens place. Then, in the last 88 pages, 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, total for 4 in tens place: 40 +10=50, and for 8:40 +8=48.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times, and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, and before that, it's 1,2,3. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me confirm: pages 1-99: hundreds digit is 0 (since they're two-digit or one-digit numbers). Pages 100-199: hundreds digit is 1. 200-299:2. 300-399:3. 400-488:4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, digit 8 in hundreds place: 0 times. Digit 4: 89 times.\n\nSo, now, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place.\n\nFor 4:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal:49+50+89=188\n\nFor 8:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal:49+48+0=97\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place again. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 times. So, yes, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's add up the 4's and 8's.\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, 99+89=188.\n\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Each block of 10 has one 4 and one 8 in units place.\n- 488 pages mean 48 complete blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages (481-488).\n- Each block contributes 1 each to 4 and 8, so 48 each.\n- The extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once more.\n- So, units:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place.\n- 400 pages: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for each.\n- The remaining 88 pages (401-488):\n  - 441-450: tens digit 4, 10 times.\n  - 481-488: tens digit 8, 8 times.\n- So, 40 (from 400 pages) +10=50 for 4, and 40 +8=48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 400-488: hundreds digit 4, 89 times.\n- 8 never appears here.\n\nSo, total 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal 8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Each block of 10 has one 4, so 48 blocks give 48, plus in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once more. So, 48+1=49. Similarly for 8:48+1=49. So that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for the last 88 pages, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so tens digit 4 appears 10 times. Then, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so tens digit 8 appears 8 times. So, 40+10=50 for 4, and 40+8=48 for 8.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so hundreds digit 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears here.\n\nSo, the total counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When counting the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit for 481-488 is 8, but 481-488 is 8 numbers, so 8 times. But wait, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for each, so 8 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits printed.\n\nEach page from 1-9: 1 digit each, total 9.\n\n10-99: 90 pages, 2 digits each, total 180.\n\n100-488: 389 pages, 3 digits each, total 1167.\n\nTotal digits:9+180+1167=1356.\n\nNow, let's check the total number of 4's and 8's.\n\nNumber of 4's:188.\n\nNumber of 8's:97.\n\nTotal digits accounted for by 4's and 8's:188+97=285.\n\nSo, 285 out of 1356 digits are either 4 or 8. That seems plausible, as other digits would account for the rest.\n\nWait, but maybe I can cross-verify the counts another way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I can calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately.\n\nStarting with the units place:\n\nFor units digit, as before, 48 complete blocks of 10, each contributing 1 to 4 and 1 to 8, so 48 each. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) contribute 1 each, so total 49 each.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in the last 88 pages, 441-450 contributes 10 for 4, and 481-488 contributes 8 for 8. So, 50 for 4, 48 for 8.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 4 appears 89 times, 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, adding up, 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:49+48+0=97.\n\nDifference:188-97=91.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've double-checked each part, so I'm confident the answer is 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. I think the digits cycle every 10 numbers. So, in every block of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, from 1-10, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and an extra 8 pages. \n\nIn each complete block, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, for 48 blocks, that's 48 times each. Now, the extra 8 pages would be from 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits here: 481 ends with 1, 482 with 2, up to 488 with 8. So, in this extra partial block, the units digit 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). \n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 (from complete blocks) + 1 (from partial) = 49. Similarly, 8's in units place: 48 +1 = 49. So, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 49 times each. That means the difference in the units place is zero. Hmm, interesting.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place per hundred. \n\nSo, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, how many hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds and 88 pages. So, let's break it down:\n\n- For the first 100 pages (1-100), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n- For the next 100 (101-200), same thing: 4 appears 10 times (140-149), 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n- Similarly, 201-300: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- 301-400: same as above.\n\nNow, beyond 400, we have 401-488. Let's check the tens place here. The tens digit in 401-488 cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in the tens place, 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears in 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here. \n\nWait, let me think again. From 401-488, the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digits are 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., 8 (480-488). So, for the tens digit 4, it's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But for 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times in the 400-488 range.\n\nSo, let's tally up the tens place:\n\n- For each of the first four hundreds (1-400), each digit 4 and 8 appear 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 times 10 each, which is 40 for 4 and 40 for 8.\n\n- Then, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, total for tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times, 8's appear 49 times. So, the difference here is 1 more 4 than 8.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. The hundreds digit cycles every 1000, but since we're only going up to 488, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears only from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total for hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. So, the difference here is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the totals from each place:\n\n- Units place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49. Difference = 0.\n- Tens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 49. Difference = +1.\n- Hundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0. Difference = +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFirst, units place: 488 pages. For units digit, each digit 0-9 appears equally in the units place. Number of complete decades (groups of 10) is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra pages (481-488). In each decade, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48*1=48 for each, plus in the last 8 pages, 484 has a 4, and 488 has an 8. So, 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each hundred has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 1-400, that's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for 4 and 8. So, 4*10=40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, 4 in the tens place is from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. 8 in the tens place is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, 4's total 40+10=50, 8's total 40+9=49. So, difference of +1. That seems right.\n\nHundreds place: From 1-99, hundreds digit is 0 (but we don't count 0 as a digit here). From 100-199, hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; and 400-488, it's 4. So, 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488. So, 4's: 89, 8's: 0. So, difference of +89.\n\nAdding up the differences: units (0) + tens (+1) + hundreds (+89) = total difference of 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting correctly in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, yes, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. 8's in hundreds place: 0. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99 +89=188.\n\nTotal 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count any digits. Each page number is considered once, and each digit position is handled separately, so I think it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it by considering each digit place separately and summing the counts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a small table to verify.\n\nBut I think my approach is correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears once every 10 pages.\n   - Total complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 48 blocks.\n   - Each block contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place: 48 each.\n   - The last 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - Total 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Total 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - Difference in units place: 0.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 pages.\n   - For the first 400 pages, each digit appears 10 times per hundred, totaling 40 each for 4 and 8.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - Total 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - Difference in tens place: +1.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - 4 appears from 400-488, totaling 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - Total 4's: 89.\n   - Total 8's: 0.\n   - Difference in hundreds place: +89.\n\n**Total Difference:**\n- Units: 0\n- Tens: +1\n- Hundreds: +89\n- Combined: 0 + 1 + 89 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's think about each place where the digits 4 and 8 can appear.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9. So, in each block of 10, 4 appears once and 8 appears once. But wait, in the first 9 pages, it's just 1-9, so 4 appears once and 8 doesn't appear at all. Hmm, maybe I should calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place separately.\n\nLet me start with the units place. For the units digit, in every 10 numbers, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each block of 10, the units digit is 4 once and 8 once. So, for units place, 4's: 48 times, and 8's: 48 times. But wait, in the incomplete block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, in units place, they are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times every 100 numbers. So, for example, in 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Now, considering the entire range up to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place?\n\nFirst, let's see how many hundreds we have. 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 ones. So, for the tens place, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10 = 40 times each digit in the tens place. But wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the hundreds place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. But in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times? Wait, no, 488 is included, so from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488). So, for the tens digit in the last hundred, 0-8 each appear 10 times except for 8, which appears 8 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers). Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, in 401-488, the tens digits are 0-8, each appearing 10 times except for 8, which appears 9 times (since 481-488 is 8 numbers, but wait, 481-490 is 10 numbers, but we only go up to 488, so 481-488 is 8 numbers, meaning the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 10. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place separately. Let's do that.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\n- From 1-100: 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n- From 101-200: same, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n- From 201-300: same.\n- From 301-400: same.\n- From 401-488: Now, let's see. The tens digit in 401-488 can be 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, for each tens digit from 0-8, how many times does it appear?\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digits are 0 (401-410: 10 numbers), 1 (411-420: 10), 2 (421-430: 10), 3 (431-440: 10), 4 (441-450: 10), 5 (451-460: 10), 6 (461-470: 10), 7 (471-480: 10), and 8 (481-488: 8 numbers). So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 8 appears 8 times, and all other digits from 0-7 appear 10 times each. But we're interested in 4 and 8.\n\nSo, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, adding up:\n\n- 1-400: 4 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times in tens place, 8 appears 4 times 10 = 40 times.\n- 401-488: 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 8 times.\n- So total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 times for 4 and 10 times for 8 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would be 40 each. Then, from 401-488, as above, 4 appears 10 times and 8 appears 8 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but wait, 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range, so maybe I should consider it as 401-488 being part of the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8, with 8 appearing 8 times instead of 10. So, yes, 8 appears 8 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nSo, total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50, 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the places.\n\nUnits place: 4's = 49, 8's = 49.\n\nTens place: 4's = 50, 8's = 48.\n\nHundreds place: 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8, so 48 each. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49, same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- From 1-400: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place. So, 4*10 = 40 for both 4 and 8.\n\n- From 401-488: The tens digits go from 0-8, with 8 appearing 8 times (481-488) and 4 appearing 10 times (441-450). So, 4's: 10, 8's: 8.\n\nTotal tens place: 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those, so 89 times. Correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the hundreds place, 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 times, as 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 97, so 188 - 97 = 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - In every 10 numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full tens in 488, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) add one more 4 and one more 8.\n   - **Total:** 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, 8's = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 occurrences of 4 and 10 of 8 in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, this is 40 each.\n   - From 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and 8 appears 8 times (481-488).\n   - **Total:** 4's = 40 + 10 = 50, 8's = 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only from 400-488, 4 appears 89 times.\n   - 8 never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 4's = 89, 8's = 0.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 97 = 91.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Because the number of 4's and 8's can appear in any of these places. Let me start by considering each digit place one by one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 4's and 48 8's. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place here as well. So, adding those, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49, and the same for 8's, 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, the count of 4's and 8's is the same.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digits go from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99). Each digit from 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place over 100 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. Now, let's see how many complete hundreds are in 488. Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 units. So, we have 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). \n\nIn each of these 4 hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (40-49 in each hundred), so that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's in the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times in each hundred, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, from 440-449, the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, that's 10 numbers (440-449). Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them, so that's 9 times. Wait, no, actually, 480-489 would be 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, it's 9 numbers. So, in the tens place for 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). Therefore, the total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from the 4 hundreds) + 10 = 50, and 8's are 40 + 9 = 49. So, in the tens place, there are 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, etc.) has the same hundreds digit for all 100 numbers. So, for each hundred, the hundreds digit is the same for all 100 pages. Now, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place.\n\nFrom 1-99, the hundreds digit doesn't exist, so it's 0. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2, and so on. Now, in 488 pages, we have 4 complete hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499). Wait, but the book only goes up to 488, so the last hundred is 400-488, which is 89 pages instead of 100. \n\nSo, for the hundreds digit, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but since our book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 8 never appears. So, 8's in the hundreds place are 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. But 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, 0 times for 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's tally up all the 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nNow for 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4's total is 188 and 8's is 98, so the difference would be 90. But let me double-check each step because maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, in the units place, I thought there were 49 4's and 49 8's. Let me confirm that.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, there's one 4. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once. So, total 48 + 1 = 49. Same for 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nIn the tens place, I had 50 4's and 49 8's. Let me check that again.\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would contribute 4 * 10 = 40 each. Then, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is 10 times, and 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times. So, 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488) and 8 appears 0 times. That also seems correct because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? Because from 400-488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for each of those. So, 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor a given digit place (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated by:\n\n- Let n be the number of pages, which is 488.\n- For each digit place (units: 10^1, tens: 10^2, hundreds: 10^3), we can calculate the higher, current, and lower parts.\n\nBut maybe that's overcomplicating it for now. I think my initial approach was correct, but let me just cross-verify.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place, the 4 appears from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for each hundred, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the last partial hundred, 10 for 4 and 9 for 8, so 50 and 49 respectively.\n\nUnits place: 49 each.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for the last partial hundred. Let me check again.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the number of times a digit appears in a specific place is:\n\nFor a digit d in the tens place, the count is:\n\nhigher = n // (10 * 10) = 488 // 100 = 4\n\ncurrent = (n // 10) % 10 = (488 // 10) % 10 = 48 % 10 = 8\n\nlower = n % 10 = 8\n\nSo, for digit 4 in the tens place:\n\nIf current > 4: count = (higher + 1) * 10\n\nIf current == 4: count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\n\nIf current < 4: count = higher * 10\n\nSimilarly, for digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nIf current > 8: count = (higher + 1) * 10\n\nIf current == 8: count = higher * 10 + lower + 1\n\nIf current < 8: count = higher * 10\n\nWait, but this might be a more accurate way to compute it.\n\nSo, for the tens place:\n\nn = 488\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nhigher = 488 // 100 = 4\n\ncurrent = (488 // 10) % 10 = 48 % 10 = 8\n\nlower = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nSince current (8) > 4, the count is (higher + 1) * 10 = (4 + 1) * 10 = 50.\n\nWhich matches what I had before: 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nFor digit 8 in the tens place:\n\nhigher = 4\n\ncurrent = 8\n\nlower = 8\n\nSince current == 8, count = higher * 10 + lower + 1 = 4*10 + 8 +1 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWhich again matches what I had before: 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, for the units place:\n\nFor digit 4:\n\nhigher = 488 // 10 = 48\n\ncurrent = 488 % 10 = 8\n\nlower = 0 (since we're in units place)\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The formula for units place is similar but without higher. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to stick with my initial method since it seems correct.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That's correct because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 4's.\n\nAnd 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book ends at 488, so no page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nTherefore, the total counts are as I calculated.\n\nSo, the difference is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit from 0-9 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add 1 more 4 and 1 more 8.\n   - **Total:** 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers.\n   - 488 pages include 4 full hundreds, contributing 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) add 10 4's (440-449) and 9 8's (480-488).\n   - **Total:** 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears from page 400 to 488, which is 89 times.\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total:** 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by thinking about how often each digit appears in each place.\n\nLet me consider each digit place one by one: units, tens, and hundreds. For each place, I'll calculate how many times the digit 4 appears and how many times the digit 8 appears. Then, I'll subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears equally in each block of 10 numbers. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each block of 10, each digit appears once. Now, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and then 8 extra numbers (481 to 488). So, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 48 times, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so digits 1-8 each appear once more. Therefore, for the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times, and the digit 8 appears 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, in the units place, 4 and 8 appear the same number of times.\n\nMoving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in each block of 100. For example, from 1 to 100, the tens digit cycles through 0 (for 1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), and so on up to 9 (90-99). So, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place for each 100 numbers. Now, how many complete blocks of 100 are in 488? That's 4 (since 4*100=400). So, each digit from 0-9 appears 4*10 = 40 times in the tens place up to page 400. Then, from 401 to 488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, 2 for 421-430, 3 for 431-440, 4 for 441-450, 5 for 451-460, 6 for 461-470, 7 for 471-480, and 8 for 481-488. Wait, but the tens digit cycles every 10, so from 401 to 488, how many times does each digit appear in the tens place? Let me see: from 401-410, tens digit is 0 (10 numbers), 411-420 is 1 (10 numbers), 421-430 is 2 (10 numbers), 431-440 is 3 (10 numbers), 441-450 is 4 (10 numbers), 451-460 is 5 (10 numbers), 461-470 is 6 (10 numbers), 471-480 is 7 (10 numbers), and 481-488 is 8 (8 numbers). So, for the tens digit in 401-488, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, the total number of times each digit appears in the tens place is: 40 (from 1-400) plus 10 for digits 0-7 and 8 for digit 8. So, digits 0-7: 40 + 10 = 50 times, and digit 8: 40 + 8 = 48 times. Wait, but I'm looking for the tens place in 401-488, which is 88 numbers. Wait, 401-488 is 88 numbers, which is 8 full decades (each 10 numbers) except the last one, which is 8 numbers. So, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times in the tens place, and digit 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, for the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450) and the digit 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, adding to the 40 from 1-400, the total for 4 in tens place is 40 + 10 = 50, and for 8, it's 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in the tens place. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-488). So, for each digit 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place? For digits 0-7, each appears in 10 consecutive pages (e.g., 0 appears in 401-410, which is 10 pages). Digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages. So, from 401-488, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times, and 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, the total for the tens place is: for 4, it's 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. For 8, it's 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 48 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Pages 1-99 have 0 in the hundreds place, pages 100-199 have 1, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, how many times does each digit appear in the hundreds place? For digit 4, it's from 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. For digit 8, does it appear in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4 in this book, since the last page is 488. So, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the digit 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each digit place.\n\nFor the units place:\n- 4 appears 49 times\n- 8 appears 49 times\n\nFor the tens place:\n- 4 appears 50 times\n- 8 appears 48 times\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n- 4 appears 89 times\n- 8 appears 0 times\n\nTotal number of 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n\nTotal number of 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = 91.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nUnits place:\n- Each digit 0-9 appears 48 times in 488 pages? Wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing 1 for each digit, so 48 times each digit. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8, so digits 1-8 each get one more. So, for 4 and 8, they each get 48 +1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nTens place:\n- From 1-400, each digit 0-9 appears 40 times in tens place. Then, from 401-488, which is 88 pages, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (481-488). So, digits 0-7 each appear 10 times (since each decade is 10 pages), and 8 appears 8 times. So, for 4 in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50. For 8 in tens place: 40 (from 1-400) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n- From 400-488, which is 89 pages, the hundreds digit is 4. So, 4 appears 89 times. 8 never appears in hundreds place here. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188.\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n- Difference: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I considered all the page numbers correctly. For example, in the hundreds place, pages 1-99 don't have a hundreds digit, so they contribute 0. Pages 100-199 have 1 in hundreds place, 200-299 have 2, 300-399 have 3, and 400-488 have 4. So, 4 appears in hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 times. That's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when calculating the tens place from 401-488, I considered that each decade (like 401-410) has 10 pages, so each digit in the tens place appears 10 times except the last one, which is 8 times. That seems correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are accurate. Therefore, the number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears than the digit '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each digit (0-9) appears 48 times in the units place within 488 pages.\n   - Pages 481-488 add an extra occurrence for digits 1-8.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each digit appears 40 times in the tens place from pages 1-400.\n   - Pages 401-488 add:\n     - 10 occurrences each for digits 0-7.\n     - 8 occurrences for digit 8.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 1-99: 0 occurrences for both digits.\n   - Pages 100-399: digits 1, 2, 3 appear 100 times each.\n   - Pages 400-488: digit 4 appears 89 times.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Occurrences:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 91 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me start by calculating the number of times each digit appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then considering any remainder.\n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be the number of times 4 appears in the units digit across all page numbers. Similarly for 8's. Let me calculate this.\n\nTotal pages: 488. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. That means there are 48 complete sets of 10 pages and then 8 extra pages. In each complete set of 10, both 4 and 8 appear once in the units place. So, 48 sets would contribute 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. Now, the remaining 8 pages are from 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits in these: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the remaining pages, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. Similarly, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, so far, both 4 and 8 have the same count in the units place.\n\nNext, let's move on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. Similarly, from 100-199, it's the same, and so on.\n\nBut wait, our book only goes up to 488, so let's see how many hundreds we have. We have 4 full hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-499), but since the book ends at 488, the last hundred isn't complete. So, from 400-488, that's 89 pages. So, for the tens place, let's calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFirst, for the hundreds 1, 2, 3, and 4, except for the last one which is incomplete. Let's handle each hundred separately.\n\nFor hundreds 1, 2, 3: Each of these contributes 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for each hundred, 10 times 0-9 in the tens place. So, for 4 complete hundreds (1-400), but wait, actually, the first hundred is 1-100, then 101-200, etc., up to 400. Wait, no, 1-100 is the first hundred, 101-200 is the second, 201-300 third, 301-400 fourth, and 401-500 fifth, but since we only go up to 488, the fifth hundred is only partial.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to think in terms of how many full hundreds we have. From 1-400, that's four hundreds. Then from 401-488, that's 88 pages. So, let's break it down.\n\nFor the tens digit:\n\n- In each full hundred (like 1-100, 101-200, etc.), each digit 0-9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, for the first four hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 4 times 10, which is 40 times each. But wait, no, each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in the tens place, so for four hundreds, it's 4*10 = 40 times each digit in the tens place. So, 40 times for 4 and 40 times for 8 in the tens place from the first four hundreds.\n\nNow, from 401-488, we need to check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nThe tens digit in 401-488 can be 0 (for 401-410), 1 (411-420), 2 (421-430), 3 (431-440), 4 (441-450), 5 (451-460), 6 (461-470), 7 (471-480), and 8 (481-488). Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 481-488 is only 8 pages, so the tens digit here is 8, but only for pages 481-488. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place in 401-488? Let's see.\n\nEach tens digit from 0 to 8 appears 10 times, except for the last one, which is 8 and only appears 8 times (since we stop at 488). So, for the tens digit:\n\n- 0: 10 times (401-410)\n- 1: 10 times (411-420)\n- 2: 10 times (421-430)\n- 3: 10 times (431-440)\n- 4: 10 times (441-450)\n- 5: 10 times (451-460)\n- 6: 10 times (461-470)\n- 7: 10 times (471-480)\n- 8: 8 times (481-488)\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, 8 appears 8 times. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place from 401-488 is 8.\n\nSimilarly, how about 4's in the tens place? Let's check: 4 appears in the tens place in 441-450, which is 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nTherefore, total 4's in the tens place: from first four hundreds, 40 times, plus 10 times in 401-488, totaling 50 times.\n\nTotal 8's in the tens place: from first four hundreds, 40 times, plus 8 times in 401-488, totaling 48 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear 50 times and 8's appear 48 times. So, 4's have 2 more in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's move on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. Each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488) will have the same hundreds digit throughout.\n\nSo, the hundreds digit for each page is:\n\n- 1 for pages 100-199: 100 pages\n- 2 for pages 200-299: 100 pages\n- 3 for pages 300-399: 100 pages\n- 4 for pages 400-488: 89 pages\n\nSo, in the hundreds place:\n\n- The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages. So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\n- The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place? Wait, in our case, the highest page is 488, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's in hundreds place: 89\nTotal 8's in hundreds place: 0\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's have 89 more than 8's.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts from each place.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from total 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nTotal pages: 488\n488 / 10 = 48 with a remainder of 8.\nSo, 48 complete sets, each contributing 1 4 and 1 8 in units place, so 48 each.\nThen, the last 8 pages: 481-488, which have units digits 1-8. So, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, units place: 48 +1=49 for both. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nFirst four hundreds (1-400): each hundred contributes 10 times each digit in tens place, so 4*10=40 for each digit. So, 40 4's and 40 8's.\n\nThen, from 401-488:\n\nFor 4's in tens place: 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 8's.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50\nTotal 8's in tens place:40 +8=48\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n4's: 400-488: 89 pages, so 89 4's.\n8's: none, since the hundreds digit never reaches 8.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's:49 (units) +48 (tens) +0 (hundreds)=97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, 91 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly? Because 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit is 4 for all of them, so 89 4's. That's correct.\n\nAnd in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but only 481-488 have 8 in the tens place, which is 8 pages, so 8 8's. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the first four hundreds (1-400), each digit appears 40 times in the tens place, so 40 4's and 40 8's. Then, in 401-488, 10 4's and 8 8's. So, 50 and 48 respectively. That adds up.\n\nUnits place is 49 each, so 49+50+89=188 for 4's, and 49+48+0=97 for 8's. So, difference is 91.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 91 more than the number of 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{91}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each of these ranges separately to count the number of 4's and 8's. \n\nLet me start by counting how many times the digit 4 appears in each position: units, tens, and hundreds. Similarly, I'll do the same for the digit 8. Then, I can subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the units place. For the units digit, the number 4 appears once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 pages, like 4,14,24,... up to 484. So, how many such numbers are there? Let's see, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 extra pages. So, in each group of 10, there's one 4 in the units place. So, 48 times. But wait, in the last group, from 481 to 488, the units digit goes up to 8, so 484 is included, which is the 48th occurrence. So, 48 times for the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the units place, it's the same logic. From 8,18,28,...,488. So, 488 is the last page, which is 488, so 8 appears in the units place 49 times because 488 is included. Wait, let me check. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, and then in the last group, 481-488, the 8 is at 488, which is the 49th occurrence. So, 49 times for 8 in the units place.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again. Each group of 10 has exactly one 8 in the units place. From 1-10: 8, 11-20:18, ..., 481-488: 488. So, how many groups are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups (1-10, 11-20,..., 481-480) and then the last group is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, in each of the 48 full groups, there's one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the last group, 481-488, the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times. So, units place: 4 appears 48 times, 8 appears 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. For the tens digit, the digit 4 appears in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is included, but 480-489 isn't fully included. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nEach full hundred (1-100, 101-200, etc.) has a set of 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, from 1-100: 40-49, that's 10 numbers. Then 101-200: 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 201-300: 240-249, 10 numbers. 301-400: 340-349, 10 numbers. Then 401-500: 440-449, but since we only go up to 488, 440-449 is fully included because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another 10 numbers. So, total for 4 in the tens place: 10 (from 40-49) + 10 (140-149) +10 (240-249) +10 (340-349) +10 (440-449) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but wait a second, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, 50 times for 4 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the digit 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since we only go up to 488, 480-488 is part of the book. So, let's count.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89, that's 10 numbers. 101-200:180-189, 10 numbers. 201-300:280-289, 10 numbers. 301-400:380-389, 10 numbers. 401-500:480-489, but we only go up to 488, so 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, for the 480-489 range, we have 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, total for 8 in the tens place: 10+10+10+10+9=49 times.\n\nWait, let me check: 80-89:10, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, yes, 49 times.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (488 - 400 +1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the hundreds place, it would be numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences:\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Units place:48\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's: 48+50+89=187\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98\n\nNow, the difference is 187 (number of 4's) minus 98 (number of 8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, wait, when I calculated the units place for 4, I got 48, and for 8, I got 49. For the tens place, 4 had 50 and 8 had 49. Hundreds place: 89 for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nSo, 48+50+89=187, and 49+49+0=98. 187-98=89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. By analyzing each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately, we find that the digit 4 appears 187 times, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Subtracting these gives a difference of 89.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 89.  \n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Wait, 488 is a three-digit number, so that's the highest page number. Maybe I should count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. That makes sense because each digit place can be considered independently. \n\nLet me start by considering the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, from 1 to 10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in every block of 10, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks of 10, and then 8 extra pages (481 to 488). \n\nWait, but actually, each page from 1 to 488 is included, so maybe it's better to think of it as 488 numbers. So, for the units place, each digit 0-9 appears equally often except possibly for the last partial block. Let me calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the units place.\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages: 488 // 10 = 48 blocks, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, 48 times each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488) have units digits from 1 to 8. So, in these, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49. So, they are equal in the units place.\n\nWait, but wait, 481 to 488 is 8 numbers, right? So, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, yes, 48 complete blocks give 48 each, plus 1 each in the partial block, so total 49 each. So, in units place, 4's and 8's are equal.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. Wait, no, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (for 1-9) to 9 (for 90-99), and then 100 has a tens digit of 0. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each hundred. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. Wait, no, in each hundred, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times. For example, 1-100: the tens digits are 0 (1-9), 1 (10-19), 2 (20-29), ..., 9 (90-99). Each tens digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and the same for 8. \n\nNow, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) plus 88 pages (401-488). Wait, no, 400 is the end of the fourth hundred, so 401-488 is 88 pages, which is 0.88 of a hundred. But maybe it's better to calculate each hundred separately.\n\nLet me calculate how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nFirst, from 1-100: tens digits go from 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\nFrom 101-200: same thing, tens digits 0-9 each appearing 10 times. So, another 10 each for 4 and 8.\n\nFrom 201-300: same, another 10 each.\n\nFrom 301-400: same, another 10 each.\n\nNow, from 401-488: the tens digit here ranges from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). Wait, 488 is the last page, so the tens digit in 480-488 is 8, but how many numbers have 8 in the tens place here? Let's see: 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for all of these, so that's 9 times. So, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. And the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 times.\n\nWait, but 488 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 401-488.\n\nSo, total for tens place:\n\n4's: 10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 10 (401-449) = 50 times.\n\nWait, but from 401-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in tens place:\n\n10 (1-100) + 10 (101-200) + 10 (201-300) + 10 (301-400) + 9 (480-488) = 49 times.\n\nWait, so 4's in tens place: 50 times.\n\n8's in tens place: 49 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's appear once more than 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only present in three-digit numbers, from 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, there's no hundreds digit. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299, it's 2; 300-399, it's 3; 400-488, it's 4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, 89 times.\n\nHow about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. The hundreds digits are 1,2,3,4. So, 8 never appears in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times.\n\nNow, let me sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\nEach block of 10 has one 4 and one 8. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 each, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\nEach hundred has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 40 each, but wait, no, 4 hundreds would be 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, 400-488 is only 88 numbers, not a full hundred. So, in the tens place for 400-488:\n\n- From 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many times does it appear? For 0: 400-409 is 10 numbers, but 488 is the last page, so 400-409 is 10 numbers. Similarly, 410-419 is another 10, etc., up to 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, in the tens place:\n\n- 4 appears 10 times in 400-488.\n- 8 appears 9 times.\n\nSo, adding to the previous hundreds:\n\n- 1-100: 10 each.\n- 101-200: 10 each.\n- 201-300: 10 each.\n- 301-400: 10 each.\n- 401-488: 10 for 4, 9 for 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 10*4 + 10 = 50.\n\n8's in tens place: 10*4 + 9 = 49.\n\nThat seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\nOnly 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\n8 never appears in the hundreds place, so 0.\n\nSo, total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers (e.g., 1-10, 11-20) contains exactly one '4' and one '8' in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, adding one '4' and one '8'.\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contains 10 occurrences of '4' and '8' in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400, there are 400/100 = 4 blocks, each contributing 10 '4's and 10 '8's.\n   - From 401-488, the tens digit '4' appears in 440-449 (10 times), and '8' appears in 480-488 (9 times).\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Only pages 400-488 have '4' in the hundreds place, totaling 89 occurrences.\n   - '8' never appears in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89.\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

But wait, since 488 isn't a multiple of 10, I need to adjust for that. So, the number of complete groups of 10 is 48 (since 48*10=480), and then there are 8 extra pages (481-488). \n\nSo, for the units place, the number of 4's would be 48 (from each group of 10) plus 1 if the remaining pages include a 4. Wait, 481-488: the units digits here are 1 through 8, so no 4. So, units place 4's: 48. Similarly, units place 8's: 48 (from each group) plus 1 if the remaining pages include an 8. The remaining pages go up to 8, so yes, page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 488 pages, the number of complete groups is 48, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in the units place, how many 4's and 8's are there in these? Only page 484 has a 4 in the units place, and page 488 has an 8. So, units place: 4's = 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's = 48 + 1 = 49. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no. Each group of 10 pages (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.) has exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for 488 pages, there are 48 complete groups (48*10=480 pages), contributing 48 4's and 48 8's. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8. So, in these, the 4 appears once (484) and the 8 appears once (488). Therefore, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49, and 8's: 48 + 1 = 49. So, same number in units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. So, for each hundred, there are 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many hundreds we have in 488 pages. That's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Wait, but 401-488 is actually 88 pages, so the tens digit in 401-488 cycles through 0-8, but let me think carefully.\n\nWait, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but since we stop at 488, it's only up to 488). So, in the tens place, how many 4's and 8's are there in the 400s?\n\nEach hundred (like 1-100) has 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, for 4 hundreds, that's 4*10=40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. Now, the remaining pages are from 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's break this down:\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 (401-410) to 8 (481-490, but only up to 488). So, the tens digit cycles through 0-8, each appearing 10 times except possibly the last one. Wait, 401-488 is 88 pages. Let's see:\n\n- 401-410: tens digit 0 (10 pages)\n- 411-420: tens digit 1 (10 pages)\n- 421-430: tens digit 2 (10 pages)\n- 431-440: tens digit 3 (10 pages)\n- 441-450: tens digit 4 (10 pages)\n- 451-460: tens digit 5 (10 pages)\n- 461-470: tens digit 6 (10 pages)\n- 471-480: tens digit 7 (10 pages)\n- 481-488: tens digit 8 (8 pages)\n\nSo, in the tens place from 401-488, the digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), and the digit 8 appears 8 times (481-488). Therefore, in the tens place overall:\n\n- 4's: 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 441-450) = 50\n- 8's: 4*10 (from the first four hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The first four hundreds (1-400) each have 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 40 each. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50, and 8's: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, the hundreds digit goes up to 4, so 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's:\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 48\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's = 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tens place. From 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (441-450), which is correct. And 8 appears 8 times (481-488). So, in the tens place, 4's are 50 and 8's are 48. That seems right.\n\nAnother check: total number of digits. Each page number from 1-9 is one digit, 10-99 is two digits, 100-488 is three digits. So, total digits:\n\n- 1-9: 9 pages * 1 digit = 9\n- 10-99: 90 pages * 2 digits = 180\n- 100-488: 389 pages * 3 digits = 1167\nTotal digits: 9 + 180 + 1167 = 1356\n\nNow, total number of 4's and 8's should be less than or equal to 1356, but I think the exact count isn't necessary here, but just to make sure my approach is correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place: as calculated, 49 4's and 49 8's.\n\nTens place: 50 4's and 48 8's.\n\nHundreds place: 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\n8's: 49 + 48 + 0 = 97\n\nDifference: 188 - 97 = 91\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the hundreds place. Pages 400-488: that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. Each of these has a hundreds digit of 4, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in the 400s, from 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 441-450, which is 10 pages, so 10 times. And 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 times. So, yes, 10 and 8.\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). So, units place 4's: 48 +1=49, 8's:48+1=49.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 91. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each group of 10 pages contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488 pages, contributing 48 4's and 48 8's.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one 4 (484) and one 8 (488).\n   - **Total 4's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n   - **Total 8's in units place:** 48 + 1 = 49\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place.\n   - The first four hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 4's and 40 8's.\n   - From 401-488:\n     - 441-450 adds 10 4's.\n     - 481-488 adds 8 8's.\n   - **Total 4's in tens place:** 40 + 10 = 50\n   - **Total 8's in tens place:** 40 + 8 = 48\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n   - 8 does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 4's in hundreds place:** 89\n   - **Total 8's in hundreds place:** 0\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 97\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - More 4's than 8's: 188 - 97 = 91\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about each place where the digits 4 and 8 can appear.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, in each set of 10 numbers, there's exactly one 4 and one 8 in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So that's 48 fours and 48 eights from the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, in these, there's one 4 and one 8. So, adding those, the total in units place is 49 fours and 49 eights. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 48 sets give 48 fours and 48 eights, and then the last 8 numbers give one more 4 and one more 8, so total units place: 49 fours and 49 eights. Hmm, so that's equal so far.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit appears 10 times every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for each digit, in the tens place, it appears 10 times in every 100 numbers. So, how many hundreds do we have in 488? Well, 488 is 4 hundreds, 8 tens, and 8 ones. So, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, and the same for 8. Now, how many complete hundreds do we have? From 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, so that's four complete hundreds (1-400) and then 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.), and the same for 8. So, 4 times 10 is 40 fours and 40 eights from the tens place in the first 400 pages. Now, in the remaining pages 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. Let's see, 401-410: tens digit is 0, 411-420: 1, 421-430: 2, 431-440: 3, 441-450: 4, 451-460:5, 461-470:6, 471-480:7, 481-488:8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears once (441-450), which is 10 times, but wait, 441-450 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 fours. Similarly, 8 appears in 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, in 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (from 441-450) and 8 appears 8 times (from 481-488). So, adding to the previous 40, total in tens place is 40 +10 =50 fours and 40 +8=48 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-400, in the tens place, 4 appears 4 times 10, which is 40, and 8 appears 4 times 10, which is 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 fours, and 8 in 481-490, but we only go up to 488, so that's 8 numbers, so 8 eights. So, total tens place: 40+10=50 fours and 40+8=48 eights. So, in tens place, fours are 50, eights are 48.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for pages 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, that's 89 fours in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, not 8. So, in the hundreds place, fours are 89 and eights are 0.\n\nNow, let me add up all the fours and eights from each place.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal fours =49 +50 +89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:48\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal eights=49 +48 +0=97\n\nNow, the question is how many more fours than eights are printed. So, subtract eights from fours: 188 -97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place: I think I considered 488/10=48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so 48 each, then the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have one 4 and one 8, so 49 each. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: For 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40 each. Then from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 numbers, so 10 fours), and 8 in 481-488 (8 numbers, so 8 eights). So, 40+10=50 fours and 40+8=48 eights. That looks correct.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 doesn't appear at all. So, 89 fours, 0 eights.\n\nAdding up: fours=49+50+89=188, eights=49+48+0=97. So, 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. When I have 488 pages, the last page is 488. So, the units digits go up to 8. So, in the units place, for each 10 pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. So, 488/10=48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing one 4 and one 8. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units: 48+1=49 fours, 48+1=49 eights. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: From 1-400, 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 numbers), so 10 fours, and 8 in 481-488 (8 numbers), so 8 eights. So, 40+10=50 fours, 40+8=48 eights.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times, 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188, eights:49+48=97. So, 188-97=91.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm counting correctly in the tens place for 401-488. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, but wait, in 401-488, 440-449 would be pages 440-449, which is 10 pages. But wait, 401-488 is 88 pages, so 440-449 is within that range, so yes, 10 fours there. Then, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 pages, but wait, 480-488 is 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but actually, 480-488 is 9 pages, so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages, so that's 9 eights. Hmm, that's a mistake. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. So, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nSo, let's correct that. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 eights. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, we have 10 fours and 9 eights. So, adding to the previous 40, total in tens place is 40+10=50 fours and 40+9=49 eights.\n\nWait, that changes the total eights. So, now, let's recalculate.\n\nTotal fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89. Total=49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0. Total=49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188 fours minus 98 eights equals 90 more fours.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the tens place for 480-488. It's 9 pages, so 9 eights, not 8. So, that corrects the total eights from 48 to 49 in the tens place, making total eights 49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188-98=90.\n\nWait, let me confirm this again. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 eights. So, in the tens place, 480-488 contributes 9 eights, not 8. So, that's where the mistake was.\n\nSo, correcting that, total eights in tens place:40+9=49.\n\nSo, total eights: units=49, tens=49, hundreds=0, so 98.\n\nTotal fours: units=49, tens=50, hundreds=89, so 188.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. From 1-488, how many 4's and 8's in units place?\n\nEach 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing 1 four and 1 eight, so 48 fours and 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 4 and 8 each appear once. So, total units fours:48+1=49, units eights:48+1=49.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 fours and 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 fours and 40 eights. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 441-450 (10 numbers), so 10 fours, and 8 in 480-488 (9 numbers), so 9 eights. So, tens fours:40+10=50, tens eights:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place:4 appears 89 times (400-488), 8 doesn't appear.\n\nSo, total fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 91, but after correcting the tens place, it's 90. So, I think 90 is the correct answer.\n\nLet me just make a table to verify.\n\nPage numbers:1-488.\n\nCount of 4's in units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place:48 full decades, each contributing 1 four, so 48, plus 1 in 484, so 49.\n\nTens place:40 from 1-400, plus 10 from 441-450, total 50.\n\nHundreds place:89 from 400-488.\n\nTotal fours:49+50+89=188.\n\nCount of 8's:\n\nUnits place:48 full decades, plus 1 in 488, total 49.\n\nTens place:40 from 1-400, plus 9 from 480-488, total 49.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one '4' and one '8'.\n   - 488 pages mean 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48 each.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) add one '4' and one '8'.\n   - Total: 49 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's and 10 '8's in the tens place.\n   - 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n   - Pages 401-488: '4' appears 10 times (441-450), '8' appears 9 times (480-488).\n   - Total: 50 '4's and 49 '8's.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - '4' appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - '8' does not appear in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89 '4's and 0 '8's.\n\n4. **Total Counts:**\n   - '4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n   - '8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n5. **Difference:**\n   - 188 '4's - 98 '8's = 90 more '4's.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about how to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every group of 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, in the units place, how many times does 4 appear? Well, from 1 to 488, there are 488 numbers. So, the number of times 4 appears in the units place would be the number of complete groups of 10, which is 488 divided by 10, giving 48 groups, each contributing one 4. But wait, 48 times 10 is 480, so from 1 to 480, there are 48 fours in the units place. Then from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so no additional 4's. So, total 4's in units place: 48.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place, it's the same. Each group of 10 contributes one 8. So, 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, let me check the last few numbers. From 481 to 488, the units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once more in 488. So, that's 48 plus 1, making 49 8's in the units place. Wait, that's different from the 4's. So, in units place, 4's: 48, 8's: 49. So, 8's are more by one here. Hmm, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, from 1 to 480, there are 48 groups of 10, so 48 8's in units place. Then 481-488: 488 is the last page, so units digit is 8, which is an extra 8. So yes, 49 8's in units place. So, units place: 4's:48, 8's:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. In the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in every group of 100. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, for 4's in the tens place, how many times do they appear? Let's see.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of complete hundreds is 4 (since 400 is the next hundred after 488). Wait, no, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 0-9, but we're starting from 1. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of how many times each digit appears in the tens place.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, from 1-100, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times (80-89). Then, from 101-200, same thing: 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (140-149), and 8 appears 10 times (180-189). This pattern continues up to 400-499, but our book stops at 488, so we have to adjust for that.\n\nWait, but our book goes up to 488, so let me calculate how many complete hundreds we have. From 1-400, there are four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 hundred, but only up to 488.\n\nSo, for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place, and 8 appears 10 times. So, from 1-400, there are four complete hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 x 10 = 40 4's, and 4 x 10 = 40 8's.\n\nNow, from 401-488, which is 88 pages. Let's look at the tens place in this range. The tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? Well, 401-410: tens digit is 0, so no 4's. 411-420: tens digit 1, no. 421-430: tens digit 2, no. 431-440: tens digit 3, no. 441-450: tens digit 4, which is 10 numbers (441-450), so that's 10 4's. Then, 451-460: tens digit 5, no. 461-470: tens digit 6, no. 471-480: tens digit 7, no. 481-488: tens digit 8, which is 8 numbers (481-488), so that's 8 8's.\n\nWait, but in the tens place, from 401-488, the 4's in the tens place only occur in 441-450, which is 10 numbers, so 10 4's. The 8's in the tens place occur in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive is 9 numbers, but wait, 480 is included, so 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480 is part of 401-488, so the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, from 401-488, 4's:10, 8's:9.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: from 1-400:40, plus 10 from 401-488, total 50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: from 1-400:40, plus 9 from 401-488, total 49.\n\nSo, in the tens place, 4's:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only non-zero from page 100 onwards. So, for 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's there. From 100-488, the hundreds digit cycles through 1,2,3,4.\n\nSo, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 pages (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nHow about 8's in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have 8's in the hundreds place, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units:48\n- Tens:50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal 4's:48+50=98, 98+89=187.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, in the units place, I had 48 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the tens place, 50 4's and 49 8's.\n\nIn the hundreds place, 89 4's and 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's:48+50+89=187.\n\n8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:187-98=89.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 89 more than the number of 8's.\n\nBut wait, let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many 4's in the units place? Every 10 numbers, so 488 /10 =48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing a 4, so 48 4's. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so no 4's. So, 48 4's in units place.\n\nFor 8's in units place: same as 4's, but in the last group, 488 ends with an 8, so that's an extra 8. So, 48+1=49 8's in units place. That's correct.\n\nIn the tens place, from 1-400: four hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's, so 40 each.\n\nFrom 401-488: 441-450 is 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 10 4's. 480-488 is 9 numbers with tens digit 8, so 9 8's. So, total 4's in tens place:40+10=50. 8's:40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. 800-899 isn't included, so 0 8's.\n\nSo, adding up, yes, 4's:187, 8's:98. Difference:89.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - **4's:** Occur once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete groups of 10 in 488, so 48 4's.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 48 occurrences, plus one more in 488, totaling 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - **4's:** Each hundred contributes 10 4's. From 1-400, 40 4's. From 401-488, 10 more 4's, totaling 50.\n   - **8's:** Similarly, 40 from 1-400, plus 9 from 401-488, totaling 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - **4's:** From 400-488, 89 4's.\n   - **8's:** None, as the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- **4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 187\n- **8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:** 187 - 98 = 89\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try to calculate the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. Therefore, the number of 4's in the units place would be the number of complete sets of 10 pages, plus any extra if the total isn't a multiple of 10. Similarly for 8's.\n\nWait, let me think. The total number of pages is 488. So, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8. So, there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then 8 extra pages. Each complete set contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for units place, 4's: 48 times 1 (from each set) plus, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), how many 4's? Let's see, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once in the units place (page 484). Similarly, 8 appears once in the units place (page 488). So, units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 4's and 48 + 1 = 49 8's. Wait, but the total number of 4's and 8's in the units place would be the same? That seems possible.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. Each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred. So, for example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 0 for 1-9, 1 for 10-19, and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Then this pattern repeats for each subsequent hundred.\n\nSo, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so it's four full hundreds (1-400) plus 88 pages. So, for the tens place, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in each hundred. So, for each hundred, the number of 4's in the tens place is 10 (for 40-49), and similarly, the number of 8's is 10 (for 80-89). So, for four hundreds, that's 4 times 10 = 40 4's and 40 8's in the tens place. But wait, in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8 (since 488 is 4-8-8). So, in the tens place, the digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, does 40-49 occur in the tens place in 401-488? Let me see: 440-449 would be in 401-488, right? So, yes, 440-449 is 10 pages, so that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Similarly, 480-488 is 9 pages, so 8's in the tens place would be 9 pages (480-488) but since 488 is the last page, that's 9 pages, but wait, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but we only have up to 488, so 9 pages. So, in the tens place for the last partial hundred, 401-488, the number of 4's is 10 (from 440-449) and the number of 8's is 9 (from 480-488). So, adding that to the previous four hundreds, the total for tens place would be 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nWait, let me check that again. For the full hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40 for both. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 pages, so 10 4's. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. Therefore, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 4's and 40 + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1; 200-299 is 2; 300-399 is 3; and 400-488 is 4. So, the hundreds digit cycles every 100 pages. Now, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 89 times. How about 8 in the hundreds place? Since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8's in the hundreds place: 0 times.\n\nSo, summarizing the hundreds place: 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's add up all the occurrences of 4's and 8's across units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = let's calculate that. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The question asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with units place:\n\n- For units digit, each 10 pages have one 4 and one 8. 488 pages mean 48 full tens and 8 extra pages (481-488). So, 48 4's and 48 8's from the full tens. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 +1=49 4's, 48 +1=49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- For each hundred, 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens digit. 4 hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The tens digit 4 appears in 440-449 (10 pages), so 10 4's. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 8's. So, total tens place: 40 +10=50 4's, 40 +9=49 8's. That seems correct.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so 89 pages, 89 4's. No 8's in hundreds place. Correct.\n\nAdding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds) = 188\n\n8's: 49 (units) +49 (tens) +0 (hundreds) = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place in the last partial hundred. When I'm considering 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is within 401-488, so that's 10 pages. The tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's correct.\n\nAnother way to check: total number of 4's is 188 and 8's is 98, so 188 -98=90. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about how many times each digit appears in each place.\n\nAnother approach: for each digit place, calculate the number of times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nUnits place:\n\nTotal number of units digits: 488.\n\nEach digit 0-9 appears floor(488/10)=48 times, with a remainder of 8. So, digits 0-9 each appear 48 times, except for the last digit, which is 8, so digits 0-8 appear one more time. Wait, no: when you have 488 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8 in the last partial set.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. For the units digit, each digit from 0-9 appears equally except for the last incomplete set.\n\nBut maybe my initial approach was better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use a formula to calculate the number of times a digit appears in each position.\n\nFor the units place:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place up to N pages is:\n\nnumber_of_units = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, that's for digits from 0-9. Wait, but page numbers start at 1, so maybe it's slightly different.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to adjust for 0. Since page 1 is 1, not 0, so the units digit cycles from 1-9, then 0-9, etc. Hmm, maybe complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of full cycles and remainders.\n\nSo, for units digit:\n\nTotal number of full tens: 488 // 10 = 48, with remainder 8.\n\nSo, each digit from 0-9 appears 48 times in the units place. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so digits 1-8 each appear once, and 9-0 don't appear.\n\nSo, for units place:\n\nNumber of 4's: 48 (from full tens) +1 (from remainder) =49\n\nNumber of 8's: 48 +1=49\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for tens place:\n\nEach digit from 0-9 appears 10 times per hundred. So, for 488 pages, how many hundreds? 4 full hundreds (1-400), and then 88 pages (401-488).\n\nIn each full hundred, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds give 4*10=40 times for each digit.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 (for 401-410) up to 8 (for 480-488). So, for each tens digit from 0-8, how many times does it appear?\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digits are as follows:\n\n- 0: pages 401-410 (10 pages)\n- 1: 411-420 (10)\n- 2: 421-430 (10)\n- 3: 431-440 (10)\n- 4: 441-450 (10)\n- 5: 451-460 (10)\n- 6: 461-470 (10)\n- 7: 471-480 (10)\n- 8: 481-488 (8 pages)\n\nWait, but that's 9 groups, each starting at 401, 411, etc., up to 481. So, for each tens digit from 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place in 401-488?\n\n- 0: 10 pages (401-410)\n- 1: 10 (411-420)\n- 2:10\n- 3:10\n- 4:10\n- 5:10\n- 6:10\n- 7:10\n- 8:8 pages (481-488)\n\nSo, for the tens digit 4 in 401-488, it appears 10 times (441-450). So, total tens place 4's: 4*10 (from full hundreds) +10=50.\n\nSimilarly, tens digit 8 appears 8 times in 481-488, so total tens place 8's: 4*10 +8=48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- Full hundreds (1-400): 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 for both 4 and 8.\n\n- In 401-488: as above, 441-450 is 10 pages with tens digit 4, so 10 more 4's. For 8's, the tens digit 8 appears in 481-488, which is 8 pages, so 8 more 8's.\n\nSo, total tens place:\n\n4's: 40 +10=50\n\n8's:40 +8=48\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 8's in the tens place were 49. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me check the last partial hundred again. From 401-488, the tens digits go up to 8, but in the tens place, the digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 pages, not 8. Wait, 480 is page 480, 481 is 481, up to 488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8.\n\nWait, 480 is included, right? So, 480 is page 480, which is within 401-488. So, 480-488 is 9 pages (including both 480 and 488). So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in 401-488.\n\nTherefore, the number of 8's in the tens place in the last partial hundred is 9, not 8. So, total tens place 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, that corrects my earlier mistake. So, 4's in tens place:50, 8's:49.\n\nNow, moving on to hundreds place:\n\nFrom 1-99, hundreds digit is 0, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 100-199: hundreds digit is 1, so no 4's or 8's.\n\nFrom 200-299: hundreds digit is 2, same.\n\nFrom 300-399: hundreds digit is 3.\n\nFrom 400-488: hundreds digit is 4, so 488 -400 +1=89 pages. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\n8's in hundreds place: none, since the book doesn't reach 800 pages.\n\nSo, hundreds place: 4's=89, 8's=0.\n\nAdding it all up:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:50\n\n- Hundreds:89\n\nTotal:49+50=99; 99+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units:49\n\n- Tens:49\n\n- Hundreds:0\n\nTotal:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the tens place for 8's was 49, but I had a confusion about whether it was 8 or 9. So, let me confirm again.\n\nIn the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 9 8's in the tens place from there, plus 40 from the full hundreds, totaling 49.\n\nSo, yes, 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the units place. When calculating the units place, I considered that in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 4 appears once (484), and 8 appears once (488). So, units place 4's:49, 8's:49. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, the difference is 90.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " Maybe I should separate the problem into these three parts and count the number of 4's and 8's in each part separately.\n\nStarting with one-digit page numbers: these are pages 1 through 9. In this range, the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So, how many 4's are there? Well, only one, which is page 4. Similarly, how many 8's? Only one, which is page 8. So in one-digit numbers, both 4 and 8 appear once each. That means the count for 4's is 1, and for 8's is 1, so the difference here is 0.\n\nNext, two-digit page numbers: these are from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number has a tens place and a ones place. I think I should count how many times 4 and 8 appear in each place separately.\n\nStarting with the tens place: For the tens digit, 4 can appear in the tens place from 40 to 49, which is 10 numbers (40,41,...,49). Similarly, 8 can appear in the tens place from 80 to 89, which is another 10 numbers. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 10 times.\n\nNow, the ones place in two-digit numbers: For each set of ten numbers (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the ones place (like 14,24,...,94). There are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), so 4 appears 9 times in the ones place. Similarly, 8 appears once in each set (18,28,...,98), so 8 appears 9 times in the ones place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 10 to 99, there are 90 numbers, which is 9 sets of ten. So, yes, 9 times each for 4 and 8 in the ones place.\n\nSo, adding up the two places for two-digit numbers: in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times, and in the ones place, 4 appears 9 times, so total 4's in two-digit numbers are 10 + 9 = 19. Similarly, 8's in the tens place are 10, and in the ones place are 9, so total 8's are 10 + 9 = 19. So, again, the difference in two-digit numbers is 0.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check. For the tens place, 40-49 is 10 numbers, so 10 times 4 in the tens place. For the ones place, each ten has one 4, so 9 tens (10-99) would have 9 ones place 4's, making 19 total 4's. Same for 8's. So yes, 19 each, so no difference there.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers: these are from 100 to 488. Hmm, okay, so the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let me think about how to count 4's and 8's in each digit place.\n\nFirst, let's consider the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, the digit 8 in the hundreds place: since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place at all in three-digit numbers. So, 8's count in hundreds place is 0.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers. Let's break it down by hundreds:\n\n1. For numbers 100-199: The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, in 100-199, the tens digit is 0-9, each appearing 10 times. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Once every 100 numbers, so 10 times (140-149). Similarly, 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\n2. For numbers 200-299: Same logic, 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (240-249), and 8 appears 10 times (280-289).\n\n3. For numbers 300-399: Similarly, 4 appears 10 times (340-349), and 8 appears 10 times (380-389).\n\n4. For numbers 400-488: Now, here the hundreds digit is 4, and the tens digit can be from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, let's check how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens place.\n\nIn 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, 4 appears in the tens place for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, does 449 exist? Since the book ends at 488, 449 is within that range, so yes, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFor 8 in the tens place, it's 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place here.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. From 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 480-488 is the last set where tens digit is 8, and since 488 is the last page, that's 9 numbers. So, 8 appears 9 times in the tens place for 400-488.\n\nBut wait, in 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4, so the tens digit is 0-8, and the ones digit is 0-9 except for the last set where the ones digit might be limited.\n\nBut for the tens place, in 400-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 8 appears only once in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 8 appears 9 times in the tens place.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place for three-digit numbers:\n\n- 4 appears in the tens place 10 times (in each hundred: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488). Wait, but in 400-488, it's 10 times as well, right? Because 440-449 is 10 numbers. So, 10 times in each of the four hundreds? Wait, no, because 400-488 is only up to 488, so in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place across all three-digit numbers would be 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40 times.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is only 89 numbers, but the tens digit still cycles through 0-8, so 4 appears once in each hundred for the tens place, so 4 times 10? Wait, no, because 400-488 is part of the 400's, so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times in 400-488 as well, so yes, 40 times total for 4's in the tens place.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the tens place: in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 times, so 30 times, and in 400-488, it's 9 times, so total 39 times.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, in 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 times 8's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. Then in 400-488, it's 9 times, so total 39. So, 8's in the tens place: 39 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: from 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, each has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8, so 10 each, so 30. Then in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, total 39.\n\nNow, moving on to the ones place in three-digit numbers. Let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the ones place across all three-digit page numbers.\n\nAgain, breaking it down by hundreds:\n\n1. 100-199: In each hundred, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, for each ten, 4 appears once in the ones place, and 8 appears once. There are 10 tens (0-9), so 10 times each. So, 4 appears 10 times, 8 appears 10 times.\n\n2. 200-299: Same as above, 10 times each.\n\n3. 300-399: Same, 10 times each.\n\n4. 400-488: Now, in 400-488, the ones digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but the last ten (480-488) only goes up to 8. So, let's see how many times 4 and 8 appear in the ones place.\n\nIn 400-488, for each ten (e.g., 400-409, 410-419,...,480-488), the ones digit goes from 0-9 except for the last ten, which goes up to 8.\n\nSo, for each ten except the last, 4 appears once in the ones place, and 8 appears once. The last ten (480-488) still has 4 and 8 in the ones place: 484 and 488. So, 4 appears once, and 8 appears once.\n\nHow many tens are there in 400-488? From 400-409 is the first ten, then up to 480-488. So, 488 - 400 = 88, so 88 / 10 = 8.8, so 9 tens (400-409, 410-419,...,480-488). So, in each of these 9 tens, 4 appears once in the ones place, so 9 times. Similarly, 8 appears once in each ten, so 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: 400-409: 404, 410-419: 414, ..., 480-488: 484, 488. So, yes, each ten has one 4 and one 8 in the ones place, except maybe the last ten? Wait, 480-488: does 488 have an 8 in the ones place? Yes, but 488 is included, so yes, 484 and 488 both have 4 and 8 in the ones place. So, yes, 9 times each.\n\nSo, in 400-488, 4 appears 9 times in the ones place, and 8 appears 9 times as well.\n\nSo, adding up the ones place across all three-digit numbers:\n\n- 100-199: 10 times each\n- 200-299: 10 times each\n- 300-399: 10 times each\n- 400-488: 9 times each\n\nSo, total 4's in ones place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in ones place: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 39 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me think. Each hundred has 10 times each digit in the ones place, so 3 hundreds (100-399) give 30 each, and 400-488 gives 9 each, so 39 each. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts for 4's and 8's in three-digit numbers.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times (from 400-488)\n- Tens place: 40 times (as calculated earlier)\n- Ones place: 39 times\n\nTotal 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nNow, 8's in three-digit numbers:\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times (since the hundreds digit never reaches 8)\n- Tens place: 39 times (as calculated earlier)\n- Ones place: 39 times\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, that seems like a big difference. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, in the tens place for three-digit numbers, I had 4's as 40 times and 8's as 39 times. Let me verify that.\n\nIn the tens place:\n\n- For 100-199, 200-299, 300-399: each has 10 times 4 and 10 times 8 in the tens place, so 3 hundreds * 10 = 30 each.\n\n- For 400-488: 4's in tens place: 10 times (440-449), 8's in tens place: 9 times (480-488).\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the ones place, as I calculated, 39 each.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit numbers: 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 168.\n\nTotal 8's in three-digit numbers: 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (ones) = 78.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the counts across all page numbers.\n\nFirst, one-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 1\n- 8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 19\n- 8's: 19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\n\n- 4's: 168\n- 8's: 78\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nTotal 8's: 1 + 19 + 78 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my calculations again, especially for three-digit numbers, because that's where most of the difference comes from.\n\nWait, 4's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 89, tens place 40, ones place 39. 89+40=129, 129+39=168. That seems correct.\n\n8's in three-digit numbers: hundreds place 0, tens place 39, ones place 39. 39+39=78. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's: 98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the three-digit numbers. Specifically, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, which is correct because from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, which is 10 times in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 10 times in 400-488 (440-449). So, 4*10=40.\n\nIn the ones place, 4 appears 39 times: 10 in each of the first three hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and 9 in 400-488, since 488 is the last page. Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 9, but actually, in 400-488, the ones place 4 appears once in each ten, so 9 tens, so 9 times. So, 3*10 + 9 = 39. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the ones place, it's 39 times, same as 4's.\n\nIn the tens place, 8's appear 39 times: 10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 9 times in 400-488, so 3*10 +9=39.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because 90 seems like a large number. Let me try a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way: count the number of 4's and 8's in each digit place across all page numbers.\n\nLet's consider units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\n1. Units place:\n\n- From 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place?\n\nIn each block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of 10 are there in 488? 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 8 more numbers (481-488).\n\nIn each of the 48 blocks, 4 appears once, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so one more. So, total 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nSimilarly, 8 appears in the units place once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 numbers, how many times? 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, in 481-488, 488 has an 8 in the units place, so one more. So, 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Earlier, I had 39 for three-digit numbers, but this approach gives 49 for units place. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, in the earlier approach, I separated one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, but this approach is considering all numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier breakdown. Let me check.\n\nIn the units place, from 1 to 488:\n\n- Each 10 numbers contribute one 4 and one 8.\n\n- Number of complete tens: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete tens, each contributing one 4 and one 8.\n\n- Then, the remaining 8 numbers (481-488) have 484 and 488, which contribute one 4 and one 8.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 48 +1 = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 48 +1 = 49.\n\nWait, but earlier, in the three-digit numbers, I had 39 for both 4's and 8's in the ones place. That's because I was only considering three-digit numbers, but this approach is considering all numbers. So, perhaps my earlier breakdown was incorrect.\n\nWait, let's reconcile this. When I broke down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, I think I made a mistake in the ones place counts.\n\nWait, in the one-digit numbers, 4 appears once in the units place (page 4), and 8 appears once (page 8).\n\nIn two-digit numbers, the units place 4's and 8's each appear 9 times, as per earlier calculation (from 10-99, 9 sets of ten, each contributing one 4 and one 8).\n\nIn three-digit numbers, from 100-488, the units place 4's and 8's each appear 39 times, as per earlier.\n\nSo, total 4's in units place: 1 (one-digit) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in units place: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nThat matches the second approach. So, I must have made a mistake in the earlier three-digit breakdown, probably by not including the one-digit and two-digit numbers correctly.\n\nWait, in the initial approach, when I calculated three-digit numbers, I considered 100-488, but the one-digit and two-digit numbers are separate. So, when I did the three-digit breakdown, I should have considered that the ones place in three-digit numbers is from 100-488, which is 389 numbers, but perhaps my earlier count was incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this problem by counting the number of times each digit appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\nLet me try that.\n\n1. Units place:\n\nAs calculated, 4's: 49, 8's: 49.\n\n2. Tens place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times. So, in each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nFrom 1-488, how many hundreds do we have? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488.\n\nWait, but page numbers go from 1-488, so the hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488.\n\nWait, but actually, the tens digit is part of the two-digit or three-digit numbers. Let me think differently.\n\nFor the tens place, each digit (0-9) appears equally in each position, except possibly the last partial hundred.\n\nIn the tens place, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times for each digit in the tens place. So, 4*10=40 times for 4 and 4*10=40 times for 8 in the tens place.\n\nNow, from 401-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, adding that, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50, and 8's: 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, that's different from my earlier count. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me think again. From 1-400, each hundreds block (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 and 10 where it's 8. So, 4*10=40 each.\n\nFrom 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8, so 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times.\n\n8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, total 4's in tens place: 40 +10=50.\n\nTotal 8's in tens place: 40 +9=49.\n\n3. Hundreds place:\n\nHow many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 times.\n\nHow many times does 8 appear in the hundreds place? Never, since the book ends at 488, so 0 times.\n\nNow, let's sum up:\n\n4's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\n8's:\n\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's:49+49+0=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier calculation. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I made a mistake, but after recalculating using this digit-by-digit approach, I still get 90. So, maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again because in the second approach, I had 50 for 4's and 49 for 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, in the first approach, when I broke it down into one-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers, I had:\n\nOne-digit: 4's=1, 8's=1.\n\nTwo-digit: 4's=19, 8's=19.\n\nThree-digit: 4's=168, 8's=78.\n\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98.\n\nWhich matches the digit-by-digit approach.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting how many more 4's appear in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to 8's. \n\n1. **One-digit pages (1-9):**\n   - 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-digit pages (10-99):**\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 10 times (40-49), 8 appears 10 times (80-89).\n   - **Ones place:** Each digit appears 9 times (once per ten), so 4 and 8 each appear 9 times.\n   - Total for two-digit: 19 each.\n\n3. **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds place:** 4 appears 89 times (400-488).\n   - **Tens place:** 4 appears 40 times (10 times in each of the first three hundreds and 10 in 400-488). 8 appears 39 times (10 in each of the first three hundreds and 9 in 400-488).\n   - **Ones place:** 4 appears 39 times, 8 appears 39 times.\n\nSumming up:\n- **Total 4's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 168 (three-digit) = 188.\n- **Total 8's:** 1 (one-digit) + 19 (two-digit) + 78 (three-digit) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " Maybe I should analyze each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me think about how often each digit appears in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place. For every set of ten consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. So, for example, in 1-10, the units digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0. So, each digit appears once every ten numbers. Therefore, the number of times a specific digit appears in the units place can be calculated by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and considering any remainder.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears ten times in every block of 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, each digit appears 10 times in the tens place: 00-09, 10-19, ..., 90-99. So, each digit appears 10 times per hundred. So, the number of times a digit appears in the tens place would be (total pages / 100) * 10, plus any extra from the remaining pages beyond the last full hundred.\n\nFor the hundreds place, each digit from 1 to 9 appears 100 times in every block of 1000 numbers. But since our book only has 488 pages, the hundreds digit will only be relevant for pages 100-488. So, the hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, each hundreds digit appears 100 times except for the last one, which appears 89 times (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Wait, no, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, so the hundreds digit '4' appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me correct that. From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, so the hundreds digit '4' appears 89 times. But before that, from 100-199, '1' appears 100 times, 200-299, '2' appears 100 times, 300-399, '3' appears 100 times, and 400-488, '4' appears 89 times. So, the hundreds place digits for 4 are 89 times.\n\nNow, I need to calculate how many times the digit '4' appears in total and how many times '8' appears, then subtract the two to find the difference.\n\nLet's start with the digit '4'.\n\nFirst, in the units place: For every 10 pages, '4' appears once. So, the total number of '4's in the units place is the number of complete tens in 488, which is 48 full tens (since 48*10=480), and then 8 more pages. So, 48 times '4' appears in the units place, plus one more if the 8 extra pages include a '4'. Wait, the 48th ten ends at 480, so the next pages are 481-488. In the units place, '4' appears in 484. So, that's one more. So total units place '4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Each ten has one '4' in the units place. So, from 1-480, there are 48 tens, each contributing one '4', so 48 '4's. Then, from 481-488, the units digits are 1-8, so '4' appears once more in 484. So total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, in the tens place: For every 100 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 1-100, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). Similarly, in 101-200, it's another 10 times (140-149), and so on. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these contributes 10 '4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, from 401-488, how many '4's in the tens place? The tens digit is '4' in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's another 10 '4's. So total '4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but 401-488 includes 401-488, so the tens digit from 401-488 goes from 0 to 8. So, '4' in the tens place occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So yes, 10 more '4's. So total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, in the hundreds place: As I thought earlier, '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400-488, which is 89 pages, so 89 '4's.\n\nSo, total '4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 '4's in total.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of '8's.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to '4's, each ten has one '8'. So, from 1-480, there are 48 '8's in the units place, and then from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so '8' appears once more in 488. So, total units place '8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nIn the tens place: For every 100 pages, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, in 1-100, '8' appears 10 times (80-89). Similarly, in 101-200, another 10 times, and so on. There are four full hundreds, so 4*10=40 '8's in the tens place. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, '8' appears 9 times in the tens place from 480-488. Wait, but 480 is included in the previous hundreds? Wait no, 401-488 includes 480-488. So, the tens digit '8' occurs in 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, that's 9 '8's in the tens place. So total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but in 401-488, the tens digit is '8' in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 '8's. So, total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, in the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is '8' only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so '8' never appears in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place '8's: 0.\n\nTherefore, total '8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of '4's is 188, and the number of '8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, '4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48 '4's, plus one more in 484, total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) gives 4*10=40, plus 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n- Hundreds place: 89 '4's in 400-488.\nTotal '4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n'8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full tens (1-480) gives 48 '8's, plus one in 488, total 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) gives 4*10=40, plus 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal '8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more '4's than '8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many more times the digit '4' appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book compared to the digit '8'. \n\nTo solve this, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places across all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Counting '4's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Each block of 10 pages contributes one '4'. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), giving 48 '4's. Additionally, '4' appears once in 484, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 '4's. There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), contributing 40 '4's. The block 400-488 contributes another 10 '4's (440-449), totaling 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '4' appears in 400-488, which is 89 pages, contributing 89 '4's.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting '8's:**\n   - **Units Place:** Each block of 10 pages contributes one '8'. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480), giving 48 '8's. Additionally, '8' appears once in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** Each block of 100 pages contributes 10 '8's. There are 4 complete blocks (1-400), contributing 40 '8's. The block 400-488 contributes 9 '8's (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** '8' does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let's see.\n\nI think the best approach is to count how many times the digit 4 appears in each place (units, tens, hundreds) and do the same for the digit 8, then subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's to find the difference.\n\nStarting with the digit 4. Let's count how many times 4 appears in the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10, the digit 4 appears once. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Wait, but 484 is beyond 488? No, 484 is page 484, which is within 488. So, how many such numbers are there?\n\nWell, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. So, 48 times. Then, in the partial set (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more (484). So total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 1 to 480, there are 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so 48 times. Then from 481 to 488, which is 8 numbers, the units digits are 1-8, so 4 appears once at 484. So yes, 49 times total for units place.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place for 4. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place: 40-49, 140-149, ..., 440-449. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so we need to check if 440-449 is within 488. Yes, it is. So, how many such blocks are there?\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But wait, page numbers start at 1, so the hundreds digit starts at 0 (for 1-99), then 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), and 4 (400-488). So, for the tens place, in each hundred block, the digit 4 appears 10 times. Let's see:\n\n- 1-99: 40-49, so 10 times.\n- 100-199: 140-149, 10 times.\n- 200-299: 240-249, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 340-349, 10 times.\n- 400-488: 440-449, but wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's 10 times. But wait, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times.\n\nSo, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 5*10=50. But wait, 400-488 is actually 89 numbers, but the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So total tens place 4's: 5*10=50.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 1-99: 40-49, 10 numbers. Then 100-199: 140-149, 10. Similarly, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each is 10 numbers, so 5 sets. So 5*10=50. That seems correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 4. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. But we're only concerned with how many times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place, which is once for each number in that range. So, 89 times? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. 400 is the first, then 401, up to 488. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with units place for 8. Similar to 4, in each set of 10, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial set, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check. From 1 to 480, 480 numbers, which is 48 sets of 10, so 48 times. Then 481-488: units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once at 488. So yes, 49 times.\n\nNow, tens place for 8. Similar to 4, in each hundred block, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. Let's see:\n\n- 1-99: 80-89, 10 times.\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n- 400-488: 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, not 10, because 480-489 would be 10, but we only go up to 488. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 times.\n\nSo, for the tens place, we have:\n\n- 1-99: 10\n- 100-199: 10\n- 200-299: 10\n- 300-399: 10\n- 400-488: 9\n\nTotal: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Because in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place for 8. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 times.\n\nTherefore, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, how many more 4's than 8's? 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the tens place for 4. I had 5 blocks, each contributing 10 times, so 50. But let me check the last block again. From 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so yes, 10 times. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times. So, 49 total, which is correct.\n\nI think that's right. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should handle each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. Let me try to count the number of 4's and 8's in each place.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears once in the units place. So, in the units place, the number of 4's and 8's should be the same, right? But wait, from 1 to 488, how many complete sets of 10 do we have? Let me calculate that.\n\nFrom 1 to 488, the number of complete sets of 10 is 48 (since 488 divided by 10 is 48.8). But wait, that's not exactly correct because each set of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. So, for each complete set of 10, we have one 4 and one 8. Therefore, 48 sets would give 48 4's and 48 8's in the units place. But wait, the last set is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers, so maybe I should adjust for that.\n\nWait, actually, from 1 to 488, the number of complete tens is 48 full decades (1-10, 11-20, ..., 480-489, but since we stop at 488, the last set is 480-488). So, in each full decade, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each digit appears exactly once per decade. So, in 48 full decades, the number of 4's in the units place is 48, and similarly, 8's would also be 48. But wait, the last decade is 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so the units digits go from 0-8, so in this partial set, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484) and 8 appears once (at 488). So, actually, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 (from the full decades) plus 1 (from the partial decade) = 49. Similarly, 8's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. From 1 to 480, that's 480 pages, which is 48 sets of 10. So, in each set, 4 and 8 each appear once in the units place. So, 48 times 4's and 48 times 8's. Then from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages: 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, in the units place, we have 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, total units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for 4's, and 48 + 1 = 49 for 8's. So, units place contributes equally, 49 each.\n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit goes from 0 (1-9) to 9 (90-99). So, in each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, in each full hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49 in each hundred), and similarly, 8 appears 10 times (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred). So, for 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 4's and 4 * 10 = 40 8's in the tens place.\n\nNow, the remaining pages are 401-488, which is 88 pages. So, let's look at the tens digit in this range. The tens digit cycles from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, in this partial hundred, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the tens place?\n\nIn the tens place, the digits go from 0 to 8 in this range. So, for the tens digit 4, it appears in 440-449, but wait, our range is 401-488. So, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers (440-449), so the tens digit 4 appears 10 times here. Similarly, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times in the tens place in this range.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit, how many numbers have that digit. For example, tens digit 0: 401-410 (10 numbers), tens digit 1: 411-420 (10), and so on up to tens digit 8: 480-488 (9 numbers). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears when the tens digit is 4, which is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. The digit 8 appears when the tens digit is 8, which is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times.\n\nSo, in the tens place for the last partial hundred (401-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times, and 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, in the tens place overall, we have 40 (from the full hundreds) + 10 = 50 4's, and 40 (from the full hundreds) + 9 = 49 8's.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, in the full hundreds (1-400), each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, total tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That seems correct.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 1 for pages 100-199, 2 for 200-299, 3 for 300-399, and 4 for 400-488. So, how many times does 4 and 8 appear in the hundreds place?\n\nWell, the hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488, which is 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is 4, 3, 2, or 1, but never 8. So, the number of 8's in the hundreds place is 0.\n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4's: 89, 8's: 0.\n\nNow, let's sum up the counts for each digit place.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the total number of 8's from the total number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make an off-by-one error or miscount.\n\nStarting with units place: From 1 to 488, each full set of 10 contributes one 4 and one 8. There are 48 full sets (since 488 / 10 = 48.8), but the last set is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. In the units place, 4 appears once (484) and 8 appears once (488). So, units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4 and 8. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: Each full hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the tens place. There are 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4*10=40 each. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449) and 8 appears 9 times (480-488). So, tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's, and 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's. That adds up.\n\nHundreds place: 4 appears 89 times (400-488), and 8 never appears. So, 89 for 4's, 0 for 8's.\n\nAdding up:\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Units Place:**\n- Each set of 10 numbers contributes one 4 and one 8.\n- There are 48 full sets (1-480) and a partial set (481-488).\n- Units place: 48 + 1 = 49 for both 4's and 8's.\n\n**Tens Place:**\n- Each hundred contributes 10 4's and 10 8's.\n- 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 40 each.\n- In 401-488, 4 appears 10 times (440-449), and 8 appears 9 times (480-488).\n- Tens place: 40 + 10 = 50 for 4's; 40 + 9 = 49 for 8's.\n\n**Hundreds Place:**\n- 4 appears 89 times (400-488); 8 never appears.\n- Hundreds place: 89 for 4's; 0 for 8's.\n\n**Total Counts:**\n- 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188\n- 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " Maybe I should consider each digit place separately: units, tens, and hundreds. \n\nLet me start by thinking about the units place. For every 10 pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive pages, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly once in the units place. That means, for the units digit, both 4 and 8 will appear once every 10 pages. So, I can calculate how many times each appears in the units place by dividing the total number of pages by 10 and then multiplying by 1 for each occurrence. But wait, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so I need to be careful with the decimal part. Maybe I should calculate it as 48 full groups of 10, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, and then check the remaining pages (488 - 48*10 = 8 pages) to see if there are any additional 4's or 8's in the units place. \n\nWait, actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48 with a remainder of 8, so there are 48 full groups of 10 pages, each contributing one 4 and one 8 in the units place, and then 8 extra pages from 481 to 488. Let's check the units digits in these extra pages: 481 has 1, 482 has 2, 483 has 3, 484 has 4, 485 has 5, 486 has 6, 487 has 7, and 488 has 8. So, in the units place, there's one more 4 and one more 8 in these extra pages. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place would be 48 (from the full groups) + 1 (from the extra) = 49. Similarly, the number of 8's in the units place is also 48 + 1 = 49. So, in the units place, 4's and 8's are equal. \n\nNow, moving on to the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each set of 100 pages, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 ten times each. So, for example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 0 for 10 pages (1-10), 1 for 10 pages (11-20), and so on up to 9 for 90-99. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit cycles again. So, each digit from 0 to 9 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 pages. \n\nSo, for the tens place, how many times does 4 appear? Let's see. From 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49, which is 10 times. From 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10 times. Similarly, from 200-299, it's 240-249, another 10 times. From 300-399, it's 340-349, another 10 times. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449, which is 10 times, but wait, 449 is within 488, so that's 10 pages. But wait, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 440-449 is within that range, so that's 10 more. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's count: 40-49 (10), 140-149 (10), 240-249 (10), 340-349 (10), and 440-449 (10). That's 5 sets of 10, so 50 times. \n\nWait, but let me check the last set. From 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, that's correct. So, 4 appears 50 times in the tens place. \n\nNow, how about 8 in the tens place? Let's do the same. From 0-99, the tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89, which is 10 times. From 100-199, it's 180-189, another 10 times. From 200-299, it's 280-289, another 10 times. From 300-399, it's 380-389, another 10 times. From 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-489, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so pages 480-488. That's 9 pages, right? Because 488 is the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 pages. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four centuries (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), which is 4*10=40, and then in 400-488, it's 9 times. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 times in the tens place. \n\nWait, let me confirm that. From 0-99: 80-89 (10). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). 400-488: 480-488 (9). So, yes, 4*10 +9=49. So, 8 appears 49 times in the tens place. \n\nSo, in the tens place, 4 appears 50 times and 8 appears 49 times. So, 4 is one more than 8 in the tens place. \n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is only relevant from page 100 onwards. So, from 1-99, the hundreds digit is 0, which we can ignore since we're only looking for 4's and 8's. From 100-199, the hundreds digit is 1. From 200-299, it's 2. From 300-399, it's 3. From 400-488, it's 4. So, the hundreds digit is 4 only from 400-488. That's 89 pages (488 - 400 +1 =89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. \n\nWhat about 8 in the hundreds place? Well, 800-899 would have hundreds digit 8, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no pages where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 8 appears 0 times in the hundreds place. \n\nSo, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times, and 8 appears 0 times. \n\nNow, let's sum up the occurrences of 4 and 8 in each place. \n\nFor 4's:\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place:89\nTotal 4's = 49 +50 +89= 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units place:49\n- Tens place:49\n- Hundreds place:0\nTotal 8's=49 +49 +0=98\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 -98=90. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with units place: 488 pages. Each 10 pages contribute one 4 and one 8 in the units place. 488 divided by 10 is 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48 each. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so one 4 and one 8. So, units place:48+1=49 for both 4 and 8. \n\nTens place: For 4, we had 5 sets of 10 pages where the tens digit is 4: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. Each is 10 pages, so 5*10=50. \n\nFor 8, in the tens place, we had 4 sets of 10 pages where the tens digit is 8:80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, each 10 pages, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 pages, so total 40+9=49. \n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. No hundreds digit is 8, so 0. \n\nAdding up:\n4's:49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188\n8's:49 (units) +49 (tens) +0=98\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"
