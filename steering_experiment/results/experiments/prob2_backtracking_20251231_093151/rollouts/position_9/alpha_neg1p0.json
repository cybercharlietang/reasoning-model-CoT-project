    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). Each full block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Plus, in the partial block, does the units digit reach 4? Let's see, the numbers 481-488: the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in there, which adds another 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (like 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, how many hundreds blocks do we have? Well, 488 is less than 500, so we have 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Each of the first four blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) contributes 10 4's in the tens place. That's 4 blocks \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, the last block is 400-488. In this block, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8, so the 400-409 range has the tens digit as 0, 410-419 as 1, and so on up to 480-488. So, in the tens place, 4 appears only once in this block, from 440-449. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully included. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). So, in the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears 89 times. Wait, no, actually, each number in 400-488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188? Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, yes, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. In the tens place, we had 50, and units 49, so total 4's is 89 + 50 + 49 = 188. That seems high, but maybe it's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the partial block is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. The units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in this partial block (number 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every block of 100, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, from 1 to 488, we have the same blocks as before: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Now, in the 400-488 block, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers, but actually, each of those 9 numbers has an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. In the tens place for 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. That's 9 numbers, right? Because 480, 481, ..., 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 9 8's there. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. Units place is 49, so total 98 8's.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in these digit counting problems.\n\nFirst, for 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 4's, and 484 adds 1 more, total 49. That seems right.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block (except maybe the last) contributes 10 4's in the tens place. From 1-399, that's 4 blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, 40+10=50. That's correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nNow for 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full decades (1-480) contribute 48 8's, and 488 adds 1 more, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: Each hundred block (1-399) contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 9 8's. Total 40+9=49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, as the book doesn't reach 800.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit concerned because 90 seems like a lot. Let me check another way. Maybe I can count the number of 4's and 8's in each position again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a different approach to verify.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears in each position is to use the concept of higher digits and lower digits.\n\nFor example, for the units place, the number of times a digit d appears from 1 to n is given by:\n\ncount = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d + 1, 0), 10)\n\nWait, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, for the units digit, as I did before, it's (n // 10) + (1 if the units digit is >= d else 0). But I think my initial approach was correct.\n\nWait, let's try the formula for the units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place up to n=488:\n\ncount = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 4 else 0)\n= 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place:\n\ncount = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >= 8 else 0)\n= 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor the tens place:\n\nNumber of 4's in tens place up to 488:\n\nWe can think of it as for each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9. So, for each complete hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. The number of complete hundreds is 4 (0-399). So, 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more. Total 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in tens place:\n\nNumber of complete hundreds is 4, each contributing 10 8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710=40. Then, in the 400-488 range, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more. Total 49. Correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place:\n\nNumber of 4's: from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nNumber of 8's: 0, as before.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. Up to 488, there are 48 full decades (1-480) contributing 48 4's. The partial decade (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. From 1-399, 4 blocks contribute 40. From 400-488, 440-449 adds 10. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 48 full decades contribute 48 8's, plus 488 adds 1. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred block contributes 10 8's. From 1-399, 4 blocks contribute 40. From 400-488, 480-488 adds 9. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - 4's (188) - 8's (98) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, there are 48 full blocks and then a partial block of 8 pages (481-488). So, in each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, page 484. So that's one more 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit is 4 in numbers like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. Now, how many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: the first block is 40-49 (10 numbers), the second is 140-149 (another 10), the third is 240-249 (another 10), the fourth is 340-349 (another 10), and the fifth is 440-449 (another 10). Now, 440-449 is within 488, so that's valid. So, each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, and there are 5 such blocks. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but hold on. The last block is 440-449, which is entirely within 488, so that's fine. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 in numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these numbers has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because the hundreds digit is only 4 in the range 400-488, which is indeed 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but actually, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there.\n\nNow, let me add up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when I was counting the units place, I said 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing one 4, so 48, and then the last 8 pages (481-488) have one more 4 (484), so 49. That seems right.\n\nFor the tens place, each block of 100 has a block where the tens digit is 4, which is 10 numbers. So, in 1-100, it's 40-49 (10 numbers), in 101-200, it's 140-149 (10), 201-300, 240-249 (10), 301-400, 340-349 (10), and 401-488, 440-449 (10). So, that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nFor the hundreds place, from 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so each block of 10 has exactly one 8 in the units place. So, how many full blocks of 10 are there in 488? 48 full blocks (1-480), and then 8 pages (481-488). So, in each full block, one 8, so 48. Now, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit is 8 in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Now, since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers except the last one, which contributes 9 numbers. So, let's count how many blocks we have.\n\nFrom 1-100: 80-89 (10 numbers)\n101-200: 180-189 (10)\n201-300: 280-289 (10)\n301-400: 380-389 (10)\n401-488: 480-488 (9 numbers)\n\nSo, that's 4 full blocks contributing 10 each and one partial block contributing 9. So, total 8's in the tens place: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers. So, yes, that's 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place (49) + tens place (49) + hundreds place (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds place:0. So, total 8's: 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 80-89, that's 10 8's in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block (9). So, 4\u00d710 +9=49. That's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Now, how many more 4's are there than 8's? So, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me just go through again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing one 4, so 48, plus one in 484, so 49.\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, etc.), each contributing 10, so 5\u00d710=50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one in 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, etc.) each contributing 10, and one partial block (480-488) contributing 9, so 4\u00d710 +9=49.\n- Hundreds place: 0, since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 4.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and one partial block (481-488).\n   - 48 full blocks \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - Partial block: 484 contributes 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - Each block contributes 10 4's.\n   - Total: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes one 8.\n   - 48 full blocks (1-480) contribute 48.\n   - Partial block (481-488): 488 contributes 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Blocks where the tens digit is 8: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488.\n   - 4 full blocks contribute 10 each: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Partial block (480-488): 9 numbers.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No pages have 8 in the hundreds place (book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of 10, there's exactly one 4 in the units place. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10, and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of those 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the only 4 in the units place here is 484. That adds one more, making it 49 times in the units place. \n\nNext, the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, in 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, in 100-199, it's 140-149, another 10. This pattern continues up to 400-488. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the last group is 400-488. Let me calculate how many full hundreds there are. From 0-399, that's four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399). Each of these has 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's another 10. So total tens place 4's would be 40 + 10 = 50. \n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Wait, from 0-399, each hundred has 10 tens place 4's, so 4 hundreds would be 4*10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So total is 40+10=50. So that's 50 times 4 appears in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488-400+1=89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units place: 48 full groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus in 481-488, the units digit 4 occurs once (484), so 48+1=49. Tens place: from 0-399, 4 hundreds, each with 10 tens place 4's, so 40. Then 400-488: tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So 40+10=50. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89. So total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: For every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), units digits go from 1-8, so 8 occurs once (488). So total units place 8's: 48+1=49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in groups like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such group has 10 numbers. So, from 0-488, how many such groups are there? Let's see, 0-99: 80-89 (10 numbers). 100-199: 180-189 (10). 200-299: 280-289 (10). 300-399: 380-389 (10). Now, 400-488: the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but in the tens place, 480-489 would have the tens digit as 8, but since the book only goes up to 488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). Wait, but 480 is included, so that's 9 numbers. So, from 400-488, tens digit 8 occurs 9 times. So, total tens place 8's: 4 groups of 10 (from 0-399) which is 4*10=40, plus 9 from 400-488, so 40+9=49.\n\nWait, no. Wait, 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10. 100-199: 180-189 is another 10, so 20. 200-299: 280-289 is another 10, so 30. 300-399: 380-389 is another 10, so 40. Then 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9. So total tens place 8's: 40+9=49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 4 hundreds *10=40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's than 8's. So, 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me confirm all my counts again to be sure.\n\nCounting 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10 (each contributing 1) =48, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens place: 40 (from 0-399) +10 (from 400-449) =50. Wait, no, earlier I thought from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So 40+10=50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nCounting 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 groups of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 40 from 0-399, plus 9 from 400-488, so 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nSo, 188-98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused about the tens place for 4's. Let me check that again. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4, so 4 hundreds *10=40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, from 0-399, 4 groups of 10, so 40, and from 400-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 40+9=49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In every group of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 full groups (1-480) contributing 48, plus one more in 484, totaling 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). From 1-399, this is 40 times. From 400-488, it's another 10 times (440-449), totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, totaling 48 from 1-480, plus one in 488, making 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-399, this is 40 times. From 400-488, it's 9 times (480-488), totaling 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** 8 never appears as the hundreds digit since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

So, in each group of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so no additional 4's in the units place here. So, total 4's in the units place: 48.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every group of 100 numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles from 0 to 9 for each hundred. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49, 140-149, etc.). Let's see how many full hundreds we have in 488. There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and then 401-488. Wait, actually, 401-488 is not a full hundred, it's 88 numbers. So, the full hundreds are 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, and 301-400. Each of these four blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, how many times does 4 appear here? It's once in 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is part of 401-488, right? So, that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from the last partial hundred) = 50.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Because 401-488 is only 88 numbers, so the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 only in 481-488, but for 440-449, the tens digit is 4. So, in 401-488, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? It's once for each ten, so from 440-449, which is 10 numbers, but since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, right? Wait, 440 is after 401, so yes, 440-449 is 10 numbers, so that's 10 times. So, yes, the tens place in the last partial hundred contributes 10 more 4's. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (including both 400 and 488). In each of these, the hundreds digit is 4. So, that's 89 times. So, total 4's in the hundreds place: 89.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, total 4's printed: 187.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in each group of 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full groups of 10 are there in 488? 48 full groups (since 48*10=480), and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 groups, there's one 8 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the last 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, in each group of 100 numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digits go from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's once in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but the tens digit is 8 for all of these, right? Wait, no. Wait, 480-489 is when the tens digit is 8, but since we only go up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in 401-488. Wait, but wait, 480 is part of 401-488, so that's correct. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times in the last partial hundred. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 (from full hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each ten, when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 187 and total 8's are 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\nWait, let me just go through that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48\n- Tens place: 50\n- Hundreds place: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49\n- Tens place: 49\n- Hundreds place: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n$\\boxed{89}$"

So, in each group of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a group, I'll take the integer part, which is 48 full groups, each contributing one 4 in the units place. That gives 48 times. But wait, after 480, the next group would be 481-490, but since the book ends at 488, we have 481-488, which is 8 numbers. In this partial group, the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 4. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Let's see how many full hundreds we have. 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds. Each full hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 more 4's. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 in the numbers 400-488. Let's count how many numbers that is. From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, in 488 pages, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8. That's 48. Then, in the partial group 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences where the tens digit is 8, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. How many full hundreds are there? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, but only from 480 to 488. Let's see: 480 has tens digit 8, 481-488 also have 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 488 is included, so that's 9 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 more 8's. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, from 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. Each has an 8 in the tens place. So, 9 8's there. So, yes, 40 from the full hundreds and 9 from the partial, making 49.\n\nSo, total 8's are 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units were 49 and tens were 49, so total 98. So, the number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes it's easy to miscount.\n\nLet me recount the 4's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups (1-480) with 1 each, so 48. Then 484 is in 481-488, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) with 10 each, so 40. Then in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4, so 89.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\nUnits place: 48 full groups (1-480) with 1 each, so 48. Then 488 is in 481-488, so +1, total 49.\n\nTens place: 4 full hundreds (1-400) with 10 each, so 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the tens place correctly for 8's. From 1-400, in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so 4 hundreds give 40. Then in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive). So, 9, making total tens place 8's 49. Units place is 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, right? 480,481,...,488. So, 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, yes, 40 +9=49.\n\nSo, 4's:188, 8's:98, difference 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When counting the units place, for 488 pages, how many 8's in units place? For each 10 numbers, one 8. So, 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last group, 481-488, the units digit 8 is at 488, so +1, total 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in units place: 48 full groups, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 is the only one with units digit 4, so +1, total 49.\n\nWait, but 484 is within 481-488, so yes.\n\nSo, I think my counts are correct. Therefore, the difference is 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check once more to be sure.\n\nAnother way to count the number of times a digit appears is to consider each position separately and calculate how many times each digit appears.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: For each digit from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, total number of 4's in units place is floor(488/10) =48, plus if the last partial group has a 4, which it does (484), so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each digit in the tens place, it cycles every 100 numbers. Each 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, how many full hundreds? 4 (1-400). Each contributes 10 4's, so 4*10=40. Then, in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n\n- Hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nTotal 4's:49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: floor(488/10)=48, plus 1 if the last partial group has an 8, which it does (488), so +1, total 49.\n\n- Tens place: For each 100 numbers, 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. 4 full hundreds (1-400) contribute 4*10=40. In the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\n\nTotal 8's:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the numbers 40-49, which is 10 times. Similarly, from 101-200, it's 140-149, another 10 times. This pattern continues. Now, let's see how many hundreds are there in 488. There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages from 401-488. In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place.\n\nUnits place: Similar to the 4's, in every group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, there are 48 complete groups of ten and an extra 8 pages. Each group contributes one 8, so 48 times. In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8. So, that's one more, making it 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in numbers like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has this once. So, from 1-400, there are 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit place (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 4 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10 (480 numbers), contributing 48 fours.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one 4 (484).\n   - Total units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute ten 4's in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds (400 numbers), contributing 4 * 10 = 40 fours.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include another ten 4's in 440-449.\n   - Total tens place 4's: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 numbers.\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute one 8 in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete groups of 10, contributing 48 eights.\n   - The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include one 8 (488).\n   - Total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute ten 8's in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 complete hundreds, contributing 4 * 10 = 40 eights.\n   - The remaining 88 numbers (401-488) include nine 8's in 480-488.\n   - Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no pages with 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: I know that in every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of ten and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the partial block, I need to check if there's a 4 in the units place. The last few pages are 481-488, so the units digits go from 1 to 8. 484 is within this range, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: Similarly, in every set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for numbers 40-49, which is ten times. So, how many complete hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 is less than 500, so there are four complete hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each of these has ten 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, what about the remaining 88 pages (401-488)? The tens digit here goes from 0 to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's only in 440-449, but wait, 440 is beyond 488. Wait, no, 401-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, but 440 is within 401-488, right? So, 440-449 is ten numbers, but 440 is included, and 449 is also included because 449 < 488. So, that's another ten 4's in the tens place. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from the four hundreds) + 10 (from 401-488) = 50.\n\nWait, but hold on, 401-488 is 88 pages, and the tens digit cycles every 10. So, from 401-410, tens digit is 0; 411-420, it's 1; ...; 441-450, it's 4; 451-460, it's 5; up to 481-490, which is 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 441-450, which is ten numbers, but 441-450 is within 401-488, so yes, ten 4's. So, that adds 10, making it 50 in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every block of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete blocks of ten are there in 488? 48 complete blocks (1-480), and then a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete block, 8 appears once, so 48 times. In the partial block, 488 is included, so the units digit is 8 in 488. So, that's one more 8. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In every set of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, similar to 4's, in each hundred, 8 appears ten times in the tens place. How many complete hundreds are there? Four: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes ten 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 481-490. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, how many times does 8 appear in the tens place here? It's only in 481-490, but we only have up to 488. So, 481-488 is 8 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all these numbers. So, that's 8 times. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 (from the four hundreds) + 8 (from 481-488) = 48.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. In 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, 401-410: tens digit 0; 411-420: 1; ...; 481-490: 8. But since we're only going up to 488, the last set is 481-488, which is 8 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 for all these 8 numbers, so that's 8 times. So, yes, 8 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 complete blocks (each contributing 1) + 1 in the last partial block = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus in 401-488, 10 (from 440-449) = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 (400-488)\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 complete blocks + 1 in last partial = 49\n- Tens: 4 hundreds *10 =40, plus in 401-488, 8 (from 481-488) =48\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal 8's: 49 +48=97\n\nDifference: 188 -97=91\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every block of 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - In every block of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Four complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) include 440-449, adding another 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 numbers.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **188**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, 48 complete blocks contribute 48 occurrences.\n   - The last partial block (481-488) includes 488, adding 1.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Four complete hundreds contribute 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - The remaining 88 pages include 481-488, adding 8 occurrences.\n   - Total: 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers in 488-page book have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = **91**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{91}"

So, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers. Each full set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of ten numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, etc. Each block contributes 10 instances of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks. Each contributes 10, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, does 440-449 go up to 449, and then the next would be 540-549, which is beyond 488. So, yes, five blocks. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, and so on. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That seems right.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, in the hundreds place, each number from 400-488 has a 4 in the hundreds digit. So, that's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: 400 is the first, and 488 is the last. So, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers. So, 89 instances of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more 8. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book ends at 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let me count how many full blocks there are. \n\nFirst, 80-89: that's one block, contributing 10 8's in the tens place. Then 180-189: another 10. Similarly, 280-289: another 10. 380-389: another 10. Now, 480-488: that's only 9 numbers (480 to 488 inclusive), so the tens digit is 8 for each of these 9 numbers. So, for the tens place, we have 4 full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10, so 4*10=40, plus the 9 from 480-488, so total 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me check: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in tens place. Similarly, each subsequent block adds another 10. But 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so only 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 4*10 +9=49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 +49=98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds:89\nTotal:49+50=99+89=188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units:49\n- Tens:49\n- Hundreds:0\nTotal:49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 4's again. I had 5 blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each contributes 10, so 5*10=50. That's correct.\n\nFor 8's in tens place: blocks are 80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389, and 480-488. So, 4 full blocks (each 10) and one partial block of 9. So, 4*10=40+9=49. That's correct.\n\nWait, but wait a second, in the 4's hundreds place, I considered 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's. But let me confirm: 400 to 488 inclusive is 89 numbers because 488-400=88, plus 1 is 89. So, correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, the 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Correct.\n\nSo, the difference is indeed 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Did I count correctly for the units place? For 4's, units place: every 10 numbers, one 4. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in units place? Let's see: 4,14,24,...,484. How many terms? The sequence is 4,14,...,484. The nth term is 10n-6. Wait, maybe a better way: The first term is 4, which is 4 + 10*(n-1). So, the last term is 484, which is 4 +10*(k-1)=484. So, 10*(k-1)=480, so k-1=48, so k=49. So, 49 terms. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in units place: 8,18,28,...,488. Let's see, 488 is the last term. So, the nth term is 8 +10*(n-1). So, 8 +10*(k-1)=488. 10*(k-1)=480, so k-1=48, so k=49. So, 49 terms. Correct.\n\nWait, but in the 8's tens place, I had 49, which includes 4 full blocks and one partial block. So, that adds up correctly.\n\nWait, but wait, when I did the 4's in the hundreds place, I included 400-488, which is correct, but I didn't consider that 488 is included, so that's fine.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98, so 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's consider the units place. For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. In each of these 48 blocks, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. The digit 4 appears once in 484, so that's an additional 1. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit in the tens place cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, in each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an additional 88 pages (401-488). In each of the 4 full hundreds, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the additional 88 pages, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. Specifically, from 401-488, the tens digit is 0-8 in the 400s. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 times. So, that's another 10. Therefore, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, the digit 4 appears 188 times.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for units, tens, and hundreds place.\n\nStarting with units place. Similar to the 4's, in every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, 48 full blocks of 10 give 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each hundred has 10 such numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, in 4 full hundreds, that's 4 * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the additional 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489. But since we're only going up to 488, that's 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times. Wait, no. Let me think again. From 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0-8. So, when the tens digit is 8, it's 480-489, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Therefore, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, the hundreds digit never is 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, the digit 8 appears 98 times.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks * 1 + 1 = 49\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds * 10 + 10 = 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 + 1 = 49\n- Tens: 4 * 10 + 9 = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each of the 48 complete blocks, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Now, in the partial block (481-488), the units digit is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 4 appears once here as well. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Let's figure out how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, the next is 140-149, another 10. Similarly, 240-249 and 340-349. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's another block. So, how many blocks is that? Let's see: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's 5 blocks, each contributing 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, let me check: from 1 to 488, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. So, in each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers. So, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, meaning there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred (401-488). Wait, but in each complete hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times, so 4 hundreds would give 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, actually, from 1-100, the tens digit 4 is in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, so that's 5 blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, 440-449 is within 488, so yes, that's correct. So, the tens place contributes 50 4's.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, total 4's = units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that can't be right because 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, but let me double-check. Units: 49, tens:50, hundreds:89. Yes, 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's are 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, counting units, tens, and hundreds places separately.\n\nUnits place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 /10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing 1 8, so 48. Then, the partial block is 481-488, which has 8 numbers: 481,482,483,484,485,486,487,488. The units digits here are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, 8 appears once here as well. So, total 8's in units place: 48 +1=49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for an entire block of 10 numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Each such block contributes 10 8's in the tens place. Let's see how many such blocks there are. From 1-488, the blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but 488 is the last page, so 480-488 is only 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, in the hundreds place, the tens digit 8 appears in 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's, but the last block (480-488) contributes only 9 8's because 489 is beyond 488. So, total tens place 8's: 4 blocks *10 + 1 block *9 = 40 +9=49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-488, how many times does the tens digit 8 appear? Each hundred has a block where the tens digit is 8, which is 10 numbers. So, for 1-100, it's 80-89: 10 numbers. Similarly, 101-200: 180-189: 10. 201-300: 280-289:10. 301-400:380-389:10. Then, 401-488: the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488: 9 numbers. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 +9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49+49=98.\n\nWait, so total 4's are 188 and 8's are 98. So, the difference is 188 -98=90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes when counting digits, it's easy to miscount.\n\nStarting with 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete blocks (1-480) give 48 4's, and 481-488 has one more 4, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 5 blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49+50+89=188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete blocks (1-480) give 48 8's, and 481-488 gives one more, so 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 4 complete blocks (80-89,180-189,280-289,380-389) each with 10 8's, so 4*10=40. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49+49=98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188-98=90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units Place:** In every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers. Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 4 appears in the tens place for entire blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences. Thus, 5 * 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to '4's, there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block, giving 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 complete blocks and a partial block (480-488), contributing 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place within 1-488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' is printed 90 more times than the digit '8'.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

For example, 4, 14, 24, etc. Now, how many such groups are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full groups and then a partial group from 481 to 488. In each full group, there's one 4 in the units place. So that's 48 times. Now, in the partial group from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the digit 4 appears once here as well (484). So total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, each digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, in each 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, 40-49, 140-149, etc. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the remaining pages are from 401 to 488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488. The tens digit here is 8, so no additional 4's in the tens place. So, the total tens place 4's are 40.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only for the numbers 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so it's 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. So, there are 178 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's using the same method.\n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the partial group 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once here (488). So total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, each digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times. So, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place every 100 numbers. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, ..., up to 8 for 481-490, but we only go up to 488. So, 481-488 has the tens digit as 8. How many numbers is that? From 481 to 488, that's 8 numbers (481,482,...,488), so the tens digit is 8 for 8 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 + 8 = 48.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (48) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 48 = 97.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 178 and the number of 8's is 97. The difference is 178 - 97 = 81. Therefore, there are 81 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1 to 480), contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - Partial group (481-488): 484 has a 4 in the units place, adding 1.\n   - **Total units place 4's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Range 401-488: The tens digit is 8, so no additional 4's.\n   - **Total tens place 4's:** 40.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Numbers 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 89 (from 400 to 488).\n   - **Total hundreds place 4's:** 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 40 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **178**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - Total groups of 10: 48 (from 1 to 480), contributing 48 \u00d7 1 = 48.\n   - Partial group (481-488): 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding 1.\n   - **Total units place 8's:** 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place.\n   - Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - Range 401-488: The tens digit is 8 for 481-488, which is 8 numbers, adding 8.\n   - **Total tens place 8's:** 40 + 8 = 48.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No numbers in 1-488 have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total hundreds place 8's:** 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 48 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **97**.\n\n**Difference:** 178 (number of 4's) - 97 (number of 8's) = **81**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{81}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, the 4 is in page 4; in 11-20, it's in page 14, and so on. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, each complete set contributes 1 four, so 48 sets give 48 fours. Now, the partial set from 481-488: the units digits here are 1-8, so 4 is included once in 484. So, units place contributes 48 + 1 = 49 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 pages. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 pages (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many hundreds are there in 488? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and a partial hundred from 401-488. Each complete hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40 fours. Now, the partial hundred from 401-488: the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's 10 pages, so another 10 fours. So, total fours in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many pages is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same for the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to fours, each set of ten pages has one 8 in the units place. So, 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing 1 eight, so 48 eights. The partial set from 481-488: units digits are 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, units place gives 48 + 1 = 49 eights.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 for pages 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 pages (480-488), so the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages here. Let me check: each complete hundred has 10 pages where the tens digit is 8, except the last hundred. So, in 1-100, 80-89 is 10 pages; 101-200, 180-189 is another 10; 201-300, 280-289 is 10; 301-400, 380-389 is 10; and 401-488, 480-488 is 9 pages. So, total tens place eights: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 1-400, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. Then, from 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are no hundreds digits that are 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's are printed. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48 complete sets (48 fours) + 1 in the partial set = 49\n- Tens: 4 complete hundreds (40 fours) + 10 in the partial hundred = 50\n- Hundreds: 89 fours\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 48 complete sets + 1 in partial set = 49\n- Tens: 4 complete hundreds (40) + 9 in partial hundred = 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98.

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the number of 4's in the units place. For every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of the 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the last partial block (pages 481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 4 appear here? Yes, at page 484. That's one more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's count the 4's in the tens place. The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, from 100-199, the tens digit is 4 for 140-149, another 10 numbers. This pattern continues. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, up to 400, that's four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), and then 400-488. So, in each of the first three hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages each, so that's 3*10 = 30. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10 pages. So, adding that, 30 + 10 = 40. Wait, but 400-488 includes 400-488, so from 400 to 488, the tens digit is 0-8. So, the tens digit is 4 only from 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40.\n\nNow, let's count the 4's in the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 pages. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Therefore, the number of 4's in the hundreds place is 89.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89, plus 89 is 178. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 49 + 40 is 89, plus 89 is 178. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all 89 pages, so that's correct. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one in the last 8 pages, so 49. Tens place: each hundred contributes 10, and there are four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), so 4*10=40. Plus, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 10 pages (440-449), so total 50? Wait, no, because from 0-399, it's 4*10=40, and then 400-488 adds another 10, so 40+10=50. Wait, that's different from what I had before. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Similarly, 100-199: 140-149, another 10. 200-299: 240-249, 10. 300-399: 340-349, 10. So that's 4*10=40. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is another 10, so total 50. So, 50 in the tens place. Then units place: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, so 48, plus in the last partial block (481-488), the units digit is 4 at 484, so 49. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89. So total 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 49+50=99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, that's different from my first calculation. I think I messed up the tens place earlier.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. From 0-99: 10 4's in the tens place. 100-199: another 10. 200-299: another 10. 300-399: another 10. So that's 4*10=40. Then, 400-488: the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10. So, total 40+10=50. So, yes, 50 in the tens place. Units place: 48 full tens (each contributing 1) plus 1 in the last 8 pages, so 49. Hundreds place: 89. So, total 4's: 49+50+89=188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: for every 10 numbers, the units digit is 8 once. So, how many full tens are there in 488? 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48. Then, in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 8 appears once at 488. So, total 48+1=49 in the units place.\n\nNext, tens place: for each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 0-99: 80-89, 10 numbers. 100-199: 180-189, 10. 200-299: 280-289, 10. 300-399: 380-389, 10. So that's 4*10=40. Now, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, but wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. Wait, no, 480 is page 480, and 488 is page 488. So, from 480 to 488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages: 480, 481, ..., 488. Wait, but the tens digit is 8 only when the tens digit is 8, so from 480 to 489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. So, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages in the 400-488 range. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 4*10=40 (from 0-399) plus 9 in 400-488, totaling 49.\n\nWait, but let me think again. From 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 only for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the end). So, yes, 9. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: the hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place again. From 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial block, from 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 49. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\nTens place: as above, 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me recount:\n\nUnits place 4's: 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, plus one in 484, so 49.\n\nTens place 4's: 40 (from 0-399) plus 10 from 440-449, so 50.\n\nHundreds place 4's: 89 (from 400-488).\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n8's: units 49, tens 49, hundreds 0, total 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, how many numbers have 4 in the hundreds place? It's every number from 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place again. From 0-399, each hundred contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place: from 0-399, each hundred contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, yes, the counts seem correct. Therefore, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count correctly in the units place for 4's? Let's see: from 1 to 488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place. Every 10 numbers, so 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full times, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in the last partial block, 481-488, the units digits go up to 8, so 484 is the only one with a 4 in the units place. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the units place: same logic, 48 full times, plus one in 488, so 49.\n\nI think I've double-checked all the parts, so the final answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - For every 10 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), the digit 4 appears once (at 484).\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.).\n   - There are 4 such groups (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the last partial group (400-488), the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (440-449).\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488.\n   - This is 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:**\n49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to the 4's, the digit 8 appears once every 10 numbers.\n   - There are 48 full groups of 10, contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - In the last partial group (481-488), the digit 8 appears once (at 488).\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - For every 100 consecutive numbers, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.).\n   - There are 4 such groups, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 occurrences.\n   - In the last partial group (400-488), the digit 8 appears in the tens place for 9 numbers (480-488).\n   - Total in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 8 does not appear in the hundreds place since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:**\n49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: I'll look at how often 4 appears in the units digit. In the single-digit numbers, 4 appears once (page 4). In the two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in each set of ten (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), 4 appears once in the units place. There are 9 sets of ten in the two-digit numbers (10-99), so that's 9 times. So, for two-digit numbers, units place 4's: 9. For three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, the units digit still cycles every 10. How many full sets of ten are there? From 100 to 488, that's 488 - 100 + 1 = 389 numbers. Dividing 389 by 10 gives 38 full sets with a remainder of 9. So, 38 full sets mean 38 times 4 appears in the units place, and then in the remaining 9 numbers (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear again. So, units place in three-digit numbers: 38. Adding up units place 4's: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 38 (three-digit) = 48. \n\nNext, the tens place: For single-digit numbers, the tens place doesn't exist, so no 4's there. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49). So, from 10-99, there are 9 sets of ten, but the tens digit being 4 occurs once every hundred. Wait, actually, in 10-99, the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. So, two-digit tens place 4's: 10. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit is 4 in the range 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these ranges has 10 numbers, so that's 4 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 4 * 10 = 40. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so 440-449 is within 488, so that's fine. So, three-digit tens place 4's: 40. Adding up tens place 4's: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50. \n\nNow, the hundreds place: For single-digit and two-digit numbers, the hundreds place doesn't exist, so no 4's there. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning 89 4's. \n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, 98 + 89 = 187. So, 187 4's in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow a similar approach.\n\nUnits place: For single-digit numbers, 8 appears once (page 8). For two-digit numbers, from 10-99, the units digit cycles every 10, so 8 appears once per set of ten. There are 9 sets (10-99), so 9 times. For three-digit numbers, units digit cycles every 10, from 100-488. As before, 389 numbers, so 38 full sets of ten, each contributing one 8, and the last 9 numbers (481-488) have units digits up to 8, so 8 appears once more (page 488). So, units place 8's: 38 + 1 = 39. Adding the single-digit and two-digit units 8's: 1 + 9 = 10, plus 39 gives 49.\n\nTens place: For single-digit numbers, no tens place. For two-digit numbers, the tens digit is 8 for 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, 10 8's in the tens place for two-digit numbers. For three-digit numbers, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, for each hundred, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, and 480-488 contributes 9. So, that's 3 hundreds with 10 each (3*10=30) and one partial set with 9. So, total tens place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39. \n\nWait, but from 100-488, the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs once per hundred, each contributing 10 8's. But for 480-488, it's only 9 numbers, so the tens digit is 8 for all 9, so that's 9 8's. So, total tens place 8's: 3*10 + 9 = 39. \n\nAdding up tens place 8's: 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nHundreds place: For single-digit and two-digit numbers, no hundreds place. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the units place for 8's. From 1-9: 8 appears once. From 10-99: 9 times (18,28,...,88). From 100-488: Let's see, the units digit cycles every 10. From 100 to 488, that's 389 numbers. Divided by 10, that's 38 full cycles, each contributing one 8, so 38. Then, the last partial cycle is 481-488, which includes 488, so units digit 8 appears once more. So, units place 8's: 38 + 1 = 39. Plus the single-digit and two-digit units 8's: 1 + 9 = 10. So total units 8's: 10 + 39 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place: As above, 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nSo total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought units place 8's were 49, but actually, units place 8's are 49, and tens place 8's are 49, so total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 187, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counting for 4's and 8's to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n\nUnits place: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 38 (three-digit) = 48.\n\nTens place: 10 (two-digit) + 40 (three-digit) = 50.\n\nHundreds place: 89 (three-digit).\n\nTotal 4's: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits place: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nTens place: 10 (two-digit) + 39 (three-digit) = 49.\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for 8's. Let me check again.\n\nIn the tens place for three-digit numbers, the ranges are 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first three ranges contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 3*10=30. The last range, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's in three-digit numbers: 30 + 9 = 39. That's correct.\n\nSo, yes, 8's total 98, 4's total 187, difference is 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That's correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For the hundreds place, only numbers from 400-488 have 4 in the hundreds place, which is 89 numbers, each contributing one 4. So, 89 4's.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the frequency of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n   - Two-digit: 9 (e.g., 14, 24, ..., 84)\n   - Three-digit: 38 (from 100-488, 38 full sets of 10)\n   - Total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + 38 = 48\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Two-digit: 10 (40-49)\n   - Three-digit: 40 (140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449)\n   - Total tens place 4's: 10 + 40 = 50\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - Three-digit: 89 (400-488)\n   - Total hundreds place 4's: 89\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Single-digit: 1 (page 8)\n   - Two-digit: 9 (e.g., 18, 28, ..., 88)\n   - Three-digit: 39 (from 100-488, 38 full sets of 10 plus page 488)\n   - Total units place 8's: 1 + 9 + 39 = 49\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Two-digit: 10 (80-89)\n   - Three-digit: 39 (180-189, 280-289, 380-389, 480-488)\n   - Total tens place 8's: 10 + 39 = 49\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No 8's since the book ends at page 488.\n   - Total hundreds place 8's: 0\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**\n\n**Difference:** 187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**\n\n**Answer:** There are 89 more 4's printed than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

So, from 1 to 488, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each of the 48 complete blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 fours. Then, in the partial block from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 484 is in this range, which adds another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for a block of 10 numbers, like 40-49, 140-149, etc. Each such block contributes 10 fours in the tens place. How many such blocks are there up to 488? Let's see: The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, does 440-449 fall within 488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So, that's 5 blocks in total. Each block contributes 10 fours, so that's 5 * 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. How many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, each of these 89 numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to fours, for every block of 10, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 complete blocks of 10 and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete block, there's one 8, so 48 eights. In the partial block, the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another 8 in the units place. So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place for blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so the last block is 480-488. Let's count the number of complete blocks first. The blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.) contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 blocks * 10 = 40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers (since 480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488), so the tens digit is 8 for all these, contributing 9 eights. So total in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 in the hundreds place would be for numbers from 800 to 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no hundreds digits of 8. Therefore, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 fours - 98 eights = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the page numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n- **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete decades (1-480) and a partial decade (481-488). Each complete decade contributes 1 four, totaling 48. The partial decade adds 1 more (484), giving 49 fours.\n- **Tens place:** 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 fours, totaling 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, contributing 89 fours.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n- **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete decades and a partial decade (481-488). Each complete decade contributes 1 eight, totaling 48. The partial decade adds 1 more (488), giving 49 eights.\n- **Tens place:** 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 5 blocks, but the last block (480-488) has 9 numbers. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 eights, totaling 40. The last block contributes 9 eights, giving 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 fours - 98 eights = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in the range 1-488, how many complete sets of ten are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, 48 sets times 1 occurrence each gives 48 fours. Now, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8. So, does 4 appear in the units place here? Yes, 484 is one of them, so that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For each hundred, the tens digit goes from 0 to 9 for each set of ten. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (40-49). Since the book has 488 pages, that's 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). Wait, actually, 400-488 is 89 pages, but maybe it's better to think of it as 4 full hundreds (1-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). Hmm, maybe I should correct that. Wait, 488 is 4 hundreds, so 1-400 is 400 pages, and then 401-488 is 88 pages. So, for the tens place, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds times 10 gives 40 fours. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 4 appear in the tens place? Let's see: from 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, then 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the last group is 8 for 481-488. So, the tens digit is 4 only in the range 440-449, right? Wait, no, 440-449 would be in the 400-499 range, but we're only going up to 488. So, 440-449 is entirely within 401-488, so that's 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, that's 10 more fours. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 for all pages from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, so that's 89 fours.\n\nAdding up the 4's in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Again, in every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once in each set. There are 48 complete sets of ten in 480, and then 481-488 is the remaining 8 numbers. So, in the complete sets, 48 times 1 occurrence each gives 48 eights. In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1 through 8, so 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 for each ten numbers, so 8 appears 10 times in each hundred. We have 4 full hundreds (1-400), so 4 times 10 gives 40 eights. Now, in the last 88 pages (401-488), how many times does 8 appear in the tens place? The tens digit is 8 in the range 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488. So, that's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, the tens digit is 8 for all of them, right? Wait, 480 is 4 8 0, so tens digit is 8. So, from 480-488, that's 9 numbers where the tens digit is 8. So, that's 9 more eights. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800 and 899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the 8's in units, tens, and hundreds places: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me double-check the tens place count for 8's. So, in the last 88 pages, 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49. So, total 8's is 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98. Hmm, but wait, when I count units, I had 48 from the complete sets and 1 from 488, so 49. Tens place: 40 from the four hundreds, and 9 from 480-488, so 49. So, 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. For the units place, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Well, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once, so total number of times is floor(488 / 10) which is 48, plus if the last number is >= 8 in the units place. Since 488 ends with 8, that's an extra 1, so 49. That's correct.\n\nFor the tens place, in each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens digit (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.), so four hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I got 188, and for 8's, I got 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nUnits place for 4's: 48 complete sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, the units digit is 4 only in 484, so that's one more, total 49. Correct.\n\nTens place for 4's: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so four hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, total 50. Correct.\n\nHundreds place for 4's: From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, total 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 49, tens place: 49, hundreds place: 0. So, 98. So, 188 - 98 = 90. So, 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I counted the hundreds place correctly for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For 4's, units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 4, and then in the last 8 numbers (481-488), 484 has a 4 in units, so 49. Similarly, tens place: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours, so 40, and then in the last 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 more, total 50. Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. So, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full tens, each contributing one 8, and then in the last 8 numbers, 488 has an 8 in units, so 49. Tens place: 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights, so 40, and then in the last 88 numbers, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 more, total 49. Hundreds place: 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4'.\n     - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8).\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '4' appears once (484).\n     - Total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's (e.g., 40-49).\n     - Total from 4 hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - In 401-488, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (440-449).\n     - Total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** \n     - From 400-488, each number has '4' in the hundreds place.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total 4's in hundreds place: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** \n     - Each set of 10 numbers contributes 1 '8'.\n     - Total sets of 10: 48.\n     - In the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), '8' appears once (488).\n     - Total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** \n     - Each hundred contributes 10 '8's (e.g., 80-89).\n     - Total from 4 hundreds: 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - In 401-488, '8' appears in the tens place from 480-488, which is 9 numbers.\n     - Total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** \n     - Since the book ends at 488, the hundreds digit never reaches '8'.\n     - Total 8's in hundreds place: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once. For example, from 1 to 10, 4 appears once (at 4). From 11 to 20, it appears once (at 14), and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we can say there are 48 full blocks of ten and then an extra 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 blocks, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, the units digit 4 appears once more at 484. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the units place is 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 ten times (40-49). So, how many full hundreds are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, looking at the remaining pages from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the numbers 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10 fours. Therefore, the total number of 4's in the tens place is 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: In a three-digit number, the hundreds digit is 4 only for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place: units, tens, and hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in each block of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. From 1 to 488, there are 48 full blocks of ten and then 8 extra pages. So, 48 eights from the full blocks. In the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once at 488. Therefore, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In each block of 100, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full hundreds in 488 pages, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the remaining pages from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 8 appears in the tens place for 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488 inclusive). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, so that's 9 eights. Therefore, the total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the number of 4's is 188 and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze the occurrence of each digit in the units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '4'.\n   - There are 48 full blocks (480 pages) and 8 extra pages.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '4's.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds (400 pages) contributing 40.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute another 10 '4's (440-449).\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - Pages 400-488 contribute 89 '4's.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Each block of 10 numbers contributes 1 '8'.\n   - There are 48 full blocks and 8 extra pages.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Each block of 100 numbers contributes 10 '8's.\n   - There are 4 full hundreds contributing 40.\n   - The remaining 88 pages (401-488) contribute 9 '8's (480-488).\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each complete set, the digit 4 appears once in the units place (like 4, 14, 24, etc.). So, that's 48 times. Now, for the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits are 1-8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, units place contributes 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every 100 numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, from 1-488, how many complete hundreds are there? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 extra numbers (401-488). In each complete hundred, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers (40-49, 140-149, etc.), so that's 10 fours per hundred. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 fours. Now, for the extra 88 numbers (401-488), let's look at the tens place. The tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 100, but here we have only up to 488. So, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0; 410-419, it's 1; 420-429, it's 2; 430-439, it's 3; 440-449, it's 4; 450-459, it's 5; 460-469, it's 6; 470-479, it's 7; 480-488, it's 8. So, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, contributing 10 fours. So, total tens place fours: 40 (from hundreds) + 10 (from extra) = 50 fours.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, in the hundreds place, 4 appears 89 times.\n\nAdding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 + 89 = 187 fours.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's in the same way.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the fours, for every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 eights. The extra 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For every 100 numbers, each digit 0-9 appears 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 complete hundreds (1-400) would have 4*10=40 eights in the tens place. Then, the extra 88 numbers (401-488) need to be checked. The tens digit cycles from 0-9 every 100, so in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480-488), but wait, 480 has tens digit 8, and 481-488 have tens digit 8 as well. So, that's 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place for the extra part. Wait, no, actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8, so that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights: 40 (from hundreds) + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 eights.\n\nAdding up all the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98 eights.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor fours:\n\n- Units: 48 (correct, since 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 times 4 in units, plus in 481-488, units digit doesn't reach 4 again).\n\n- Tens: 4 hundreds * 10 = 40, plus in 401-488, 440-449 is 10 fours, so 40 +10=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 fours. Correct.\n\nTotal fours: 48+50+89=187. That seems right.\n\nFor eights:\n\n- Units: 48 complete sets (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, 481-488 has 8 in units place once (488), so total 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens: 4 hundreds *10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total 40+9=49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds: 0. Correct.\n\nTotal eights: 49+49=98.\n\nSo, 187 fours - 98 eights = 89 more fours. So, the answer should be 89.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 187, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 187 - 98 = 89.\n\n\\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. So, I can calculate how many complete blocks of 10 there are in 488 pages. 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete blocks and then an extra 8 pages. Each block contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That adds one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: In every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. For example, from 40-49, each of these 10 numbers has a 4 in the tens place. So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there in 488? That's 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 4's, so that's 4*10=40. Then, the remaining pages are 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for pages 400-409, but wait, the book only goes up to 488, so from 400-488. The tens digit is 0 for 400-409, then 1 for 410-419, and so on up to 8 for 480-488. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct that. Actually, the tens digit in 400-409 is 0, 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, 450-459 is 5, 460-469 is 6, 470-479 is 7, and 480-488 is 8. So, in the range 400-488, the tens digit is 4 only in the 440-449 range. That's 10 pages (440-449), but wait, the book ends at 488, so 440-449 is entirely within 400-488. So, that's 10 more 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from the four complete blocks) + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, every block of 10 has one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In every block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). So, how many complete blocks of 100 are there? 4 complete blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 8's in the tens place, so 4*10=40. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Let's see, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, subtracting the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks (1-480) each contributing 1, so 48. Then, 481-488: 484 is the only one, so +1. Total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks (1-400) each contributing 10, so 40. Then, 400-488: 440-449 is 10, so +10. Total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full blocks, +1 for 488, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full blocks *10=40. Then, 480-488: 9 numbers, so +9. Total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units place:** In each block of 10 pages, 4 appears once. With 48 full blocks (480 pages) and one additional page (484), total 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each block of 100 pages, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. With 4 full blocks (400 pages) and an additional 10 in 440-449, total 50.\n- **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units place:** In each block of 10 pages, 8 appears once. With 48 full blocks and one additional page (488), total 49.\n- **Tens place:** In each block of 100 pages, 8 appears 10 times. With 4 full blocks and an additional 9 in 480-488, total 49.\n- **Hundreds place:** No 8's appear here as the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In the numbers 1 to 488, how often does 4 appear in the units place? Well, every 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 consecutive numbers, 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 numbers? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a set, we'll take the integer part, which is 48 full sets. Each set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. But wait, 488 is the last page, so in the 49th set (which would be 480-489), we have 488 as the last page. So, 480-488 is 9 numbers, and in the units place, 484 is the only one with a 4. So, that's one more 4. So, total 4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: How many times does 4 appear in the tens place? The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all 10 numbers. Similarly, from 140-149, and so on. Let me calculate how many such blocks there are. The first block is 40-49, which is 10 numbers. Then, 140-149, another 10. 240-249, another 10. 340-349, another 10. 440-449, another 10. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so the last block would be 440-449, because 450-459 is beyond 488? Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so 440-449 is within 488, and 450-459 would be up to 459, which is still less than 488. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so after 440-449 comes 450-459, then 460-469, 470-479, and 480-488. So, how many blocks of 100 are there? 488 is less than 500, so we have four complete hundreds: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488. Wait, actually, 400-488 is part of the 400-499 range, but we only go up to 488. So, for the tens place, each hundred block contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place. So, from 40-49 in each hundred, that's 10 times. Now, how many hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So that's five blocks. Wait, but in each of these blocks except the last one, the tens digit 4 occurs exactly 10 times. In the last block, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8 in the tens place. So, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's 10 times. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place: 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50. Wait, but 400-488 is the fifth block, and in that block, the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times as well, so yes, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: How many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: How many times does 8 appear in the units digit? Similar to the 4's, every 10 numbers, 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8. Then, in the partial set 480-488, the units digit 8 appears once (488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: How many times does 8 appear in the tens digit? Similar to the 4's, each block of 100 numbers has a block where the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers. So, from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last block is 480-488, which has 9 numbers (480-488), so the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488 for 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), but wait, the tens digit is 8 for all these, so actually, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. Wait, no, 480 has tens digit 8, 481 has 8, up to 488. So, that's 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, in each hundred block, except the last one, we have 10 occurrences. Let me count:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers\n- 400-488: 480-488 \u2192 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nSo, total 8's in tens place: 4 blocks \u00d7 10 + 1 block \u00d7 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: How many times does 8 appear in the hundreds digit? The hundreds digit is 8 for numbers from 800 to 899. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 49\n- Tens: 49\n- Hundreds: 0\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 4 appears once, in page 4. The digit 8 appears once, in page 8. So, so far, 4's count is 1, and 8's count is 1.\n\nNow, moving on to two-digit numbers (10-99). Let's consider the units place first. For each ten's group (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place (e.g., 14, 24, etc.). There are 9 such groups (10-99), so that's 9 times. Similarly, the digit 8 appears once in each group, so that's 9 times as well. Wait, but hold on, page numbers go up to 488, so I need to make sure I'm not overcounting. But in two-digit numbers, the maximum is 99, so that's fine. So, units place: 9 4's and 9 8's. Now, the tens place for two-digit numbers: For each ten's group, the tens digit is 4 once (e.g., 40-49). So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears 10 times (since 40-49 is 10 numbers). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (80-89). So, for two-digit numbers, tens place contributes 10 4's and 10 8's. Adding up the units and tens places for two-digit numbers: 4's: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. 8's: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit numbers (100-488). Let's break this down by each digit place: hundreds, tens, and units. \n\nStarting with the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. But since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit 4 only goes up to 488, not 499. So, for the hundreds place, the digit 4 appears in 400-488. Let's see how many numbers that is: from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds place contributes 89 4's. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so hundreds digit can't be 8. So, hundreds place: 89 4's, 0 8's.\n\nNow, the tens place for three-digit numbers. Let's consider each hundred group separately: 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. For each hundred group, the tens digit cycles from 0-9. So, in each hundred group, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, etc.), except possibly the last group (400-488). Similarly for the digit 8.\n\nFor 100-199: Tens digit 4 appears 10 times (140-149). Similarly, tens digit 8 appears 10 times (180-189).\n\nFor 200-299: Same as above, 10 times each.\n\nFor 300-399: Same again, 10 times each.\n\nFor 400-488: The tens digit can go from 0-8 because 488 is the last page. So, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. The tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's only 9 numbers (480-488). So, for 400-488, tens digit 4: 10, tens digit 8: 9.\n\nAdding up the tens places across all hundred groups: For 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 10 (400-488) = 40. For 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, the units place for three-digit numbers. Again, considering each hundred group:\n\nFor 100-199: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten. So, in each ten, the units digit 4 appears once, and 8 appears once. There are 10 tens in each hundred group, so for 100-199, units digit 4: 10 times, units digit 8: 10 times.\n\nSimilarly for 200-299 and 300-399: Each contributes 10 4's and 10 8's in the units place.\n\nFor 400-488: The units digit cycles 0-9 for each ten, but since it goes up to 488, the last ten is 480-488, which is only 9 numbers. So, in the units place, for each ten, 4 appears once if the ten includes a units digit 4, and similarly for 8.\n\nLet me calculate this more carefully. From 400-488, each ten's group (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). For each ten's group except the last, the units digit cycles 0-9, so each contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place. The last group, 480-488, has units digits 0-8, so it contributes one 4 (484) and one 8 (488). Wait, but 484 is within 480-488, so yes, it contributes a 4. Similarly, 488 is included, so it contributes an 8. So, actually, each ten's group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, regardless of whether it's the last group or not. Therefore, the number of ten's groups in 400-488 is 9 (400-409, 410-419, ..., 480-488). Each contributes one 4 and one 8, so units digit 4: 9 times, units digit 8: 9 times.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-409: units digits 0-9, so 4 appears once (404) and 8 appears once (408). Similarly, 410-419: 414 and 418. This continues up to 480-488. But wait, 480-488 is only 9 numbers, so units digits go up to 8. So, in this group, 484 is present (units digit 4) and 488 is present (units digit 8). So, yes, each ten's group contributes one 4 and one 8 in the units place, even the last one. Therefore, 9 ten's groups, each contributing one 4 and one 8, so units digit 4: 9, units digit 8: 9.\n\nAdding up the units places across all hundred groups: For 4's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39. For 8's: 10 (100-199) + 10 (200-299) + 10 (300-399) + 9 (400-488) = 39.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the 4's and 8's across all digit places.\n\nFirst, single-digit numbers:\n4's: 1\n8's: 1\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n4's: 19\n8's: 19\n\nThree-digit numbers:\nHundreds place: 4's:89, 8's:0\nTens place: 4's:40, 8's:39\nUnits place: 4's:39, 8's:39\n\nSo, total 4's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = let's calculate step by step.\n\n1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 89 = 109\n109 + 40 = 149\n149 + 39 = 188\n\nTotal 4's: 188\n\nTotal 8's: 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = \n\n1 + 19 = 20\n20 + 0 = 20\n20 + 39 = 59\n59 + 39 = 98\n\nSo, total 8's: 98\n\nNow, the difference: 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSingle-digit: 4's=1, 8's=1.\n\nTwo-digit:\nUnits place: 9 each\nTens place: 10 each\nTotal: 19 each. So, 19 4's and 19 8's.\n\nThree-digit:\nHundreds: 89 4's, 0 8's\nTens: 40 4's, 39 8's\nUnits: 39 4's, 39 8's\nTotal three-digit 4's: 89+40+39=168\nTotal three-digit 8's: 0+39+39=78\n\nAdding single and two-digit:\nTotal 4's: 1+19+168=188\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, seems correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of times the digit 4 appears in the page numbers of a 488-page book is 188, while the digit 8 appears 98 times. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Single-Digit Pages (1-9):**\n   - Digit 4 appears once (page 4).\n   - Digit 8 appears once (page 8).\n\n2. **Two-Digit Pages (10-99):**\n   - **Units Place:** Each ten's group (10-19, 20-29, etc.) has one 4 and one 8. There are 9 groups, so 9 each.\n   - **Tens Place:** For each digit 4 and 8, there are 10 numbers (e.g., 40-49 for 4, 80-89 for 8). So, 10 each.\n   - **Total for Two-Digits:** 19 each (9 units + 10 tens).\n\n3. **Three-Digit Pages (100-488):**\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - Digit 4 appears in 400-488, which is 89 numbers.\n     - Digit 8 doesn't appear in the hundreds place.\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - For each hundred group (100-199, 200-299, 300-399), digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 140-149), totaling 30. In 400-488, digit 4 appears 10 times (440-449).\n     - Digit 8 appears 10 times in each of the first three hundred groups and 9 times in 400-488 (480-488), totaling 39.\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each hundred group contributes 10 4's and 10 8's except the last group (400-488), which contributes 9 each due to ending at 488.\n     - Total for 4's: 30 (first three groups) + 9 (last group) = 39.\n     - Total for 8's: 30 (first three groups) + 9 (last group) = 39.\n\n4. **Summing Up:**\n   - **Total 4's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 89 (hundreds) + 40 (tens) + 39 (units) = 188.\n   - **Total 8's:** 1 (single) + 19 (two-digit) + 0 (hundreds) + 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 98.\n   - **Difference:** 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's printed than 8's.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten, and then an extra 8 pages (481-488). In each full set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear there. So, units place gives me 48 fours.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, each digit from 0 to 9 appears exactly 10 times in the tens place. So, for the tens digit being 4, each hundred contributes 10 fours. Now, up to 488, we have four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399) and then 400-488. \n\nIn each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit is 4 for 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349. So that's 4 sets of 10, which is 40 fours in the tens place from the first four hundreds. Now, in the last partial hundred, 400-488, the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449. That's another 10 fours. So, total tens place fours are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 0-399, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40. Then from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so another 10. So, total is 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only from page 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nSo, adding up all the fours: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 = 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 fours in total.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to fours, in each set of ten, the units digit 8 appears once. So, from 1 to 488, how many tens are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full tens, and then 8 extra pages. Each full ten contributes one 8, so 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (on page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, for the tens digit being 8, each hundred contributes 10 eights. From 0-399, that's four hundreds, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40 eights. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, we have 40 (from 0-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49 eights.\n\nWait, let me check that. From 0-399, each hundred has 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, that's 9 eights. So, total tens place eights are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are zero eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. For units place, 48 full tens give 48 eights, and the last partial ten (481-488) has one more 8 (page 488). So, units: 49. Tens: each hundred up to 399 gives 10 eights, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40, and then from 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, 40 + 9 = 49. So, total eights are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, units place is 49, tens place is 49, so total eights are 49 + 49 = 98. But wait, let me check the tens place again. From 0-399, each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place. So, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but when I count the units place, I have 48 full tens (each contributing one 8) and then one more in the last partial ten (page 488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 units eights. Similarly, tens place: 40 (from 0-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 49. So, total eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me think about the hundreds place again. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place eights are zero.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of fours was 187, and the number of eights is 98. So, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the fours. Let me recount the fours:\n\nUnits place: 48 fours.\n\nTens place: 50 fours.\n\nHundreds place: 89 fours.\n\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nEights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nSo, 187 fours minus 98 eights is 89.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the tens place for fours. Let me check that again.\n\nFor the tens place fours: From 0-399, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 \u00d7 10 = 40. Then, from 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd units place fours: 48 fours.\n\nHundreds place fours: 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nEights: units 49, tens 49, total 98.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but let me check the hundreds place fours again. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 fours there. That seems right.\n\nAnother way to think about it: For each digit position, count how many times 4 and 8 appear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor the units digit:\n\nNumber of times a digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if d \u2264 (N mod 10) else 0).\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, it's floor(N/100) * 10 + (min(max(d, (N mod 100) // 10 + 1), 10) if (N mod 100) >= d*10 else 0).\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, I can think of each position separately.\n\nWait, perhaps I should confirm the counts again.\n\nFor fours:\n\nUnits: In each block of 10, one 4. So, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 fours. Then, the last partial block is 481-488, which doesn't include a 4 in the units place, so total units fours: 48.\n\nTens: In each block of 100, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each 100, there are 10 fours in the tens place. So, 488 / 100 = 4.88, so 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours: 4*10=40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nHundreds: The hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers. So, 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 48 + 50 + 89 = 187.\n\nFor eights:\n\nUnits: Each block of 10 has one 8. 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48 eights. The last partial block (481-488) includes 488, which has an 8 in the units place, so that's one more. So, total units eights: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens: Each block of 100 has 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds contribute 4*10=40 eights. In the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nHundreds: No eights in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 187 - 98 = 89.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought the answer was 89, but I want to make sure I didn't double-count or miss anything. Let me check the counts once more.\n\nAnother approach: Let's list out how many times each digit appears in each position.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's: floor(488/10) = 48. Since 488 mod 10 is 8, which is >=4, so add 1? Wait, no, the formula is floor(N/10) + (1 if d <= (N mod 10) else 0). So, for 4, since 8 >=4, we add 1. Wait, but earlier I thought it was 48 fours in units place. Wait, no, that might be a mistake.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The number of times digit d appears in the units place from 1 to N is:\n\nnumber = (N // 10) + (1 if (N % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nSo, for d=4, N=488.\n\nN // 10 = 48, and N % 10 = 8. Since 8 >=4, we add 1, so total units fours: 48 +1=49.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 48. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, let's test this formula. For example, from 1 to 10, the units digit 4 appears once (at 4). So, N=10, N//10=1, N%10=0. Since 0 <4, so units fours=1+0=1. Correct.\n\nFrom 1 to 14: N=14, N//10=1, N%10=4. Since 4>=4, units fours=1+1=2 (4 and 14). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, from 1 to 20: N=20, N//10=2, N%10=0. Units fours=2+0=2 (4 and 14). Correct.\n\nSo, applying this to N=488, d=4:\n\nUnits fours=48 +1=49.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought units fours were 48, but actually it's 49. Hmm, that changes things.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nUnits eights=488//10=48, and 488%10=8. Since 8>=8, add 1. So, units eights=48+1=49. Which matches what I had before.\n\nSo, units fours are 49, not 48. That was my mistake earlier.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nSo, fours:\n\nUnits: 49.\n\nTens: As before, each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40 +10=50.\n\nHundreds: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89.\n\nTotal fours: 49 +50 +89= 188.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, I had a mistake in the units place count.\n\nSimilarly, for eights:\n\nUnits eights: 49.\n\nTens eights: Each hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place, so 4*10=40. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds eights: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) +50 (tens) +89 (hundreds)=188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) +49 (tens)=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nWait, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the units place for fours, which affected the total. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, let me confirm again.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nNumber of times digit d appears in units place from 1 to N is floor(N/10) + (1 if d <= (N mod 10) else 0).\n\nFor d=4, N=488:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, 488 mod 10=8. Since 8 >=4, add 1. So, units fours=48+1=49.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\nfloor(488/10)=48, 488 mod 10=8. Since 8>=8, add 1. So, units eights=48+1=49.\n\nSo, units fours=49, units eights=49.\n\nTens place for fours:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So, 4 full hundreds: 4*10=40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 is in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, 40+10=50.\n\nTens place for eights:\n\nEach hundred contributes 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4*10=40. In 400-488, the tens digit 8 is in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 40+9=49.\n\nHundreds place for fours: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nHundreds place for eights: 0.\n\nSo, total fours: 49+50+89=188.\n\nTotal eights:49+49=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be 90 more fours than eights.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I thought it was 89, but now it's 90. Let me check the units place again.\n\nWait, when I thought units fours were 48, that was incorrect. Using the formula, it's 49. So, that's where the extra one comes from. So, total fours are 188, eights are 98, so 188-98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits '4' and '8' in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit '4':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one '4' in the units place.\n     - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: floor(488 / 10) = 48.\n     - Since 488 mod 10 = 8, which is \u22654, add 1 more '4'.\n     - Total '4's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred contributes 10 '4's in the tens place.\n     - From 1 to 399: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - From 400-488: '4' appears in 440-449, contributing 10 '4's.\n     - Total '4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - '4' appears in the hundreds place from 400 to 488.\n     - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n     - Total '4's in hundreds place: 89.\n\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit '8':**\n\n   - **Units Place:**\n     - Each set of 10 numbers contributes one '8' in the units place.\n     - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: floor(488 / 10) = 48.\n     - Since 488 mod 10 = 8, which is \u22658, add 1 more '8'.\n     - Total '8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n   - **Tens Place:**\n     - Each hundred contributes 10 '8's in the tens place.\n     - From 1 to 399: 4 hundreds \u00d7 10 = 40.\n     - From 400-488: '8' appears in 480-488, contributing 9 '8's.\n     - Total '8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n   - **Hundreds Place:**\n     - No page numbers have '8' in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n     - Total '8's in hundreds place: 0.\n\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188.\n   - Number of '8's: 98.\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

For example, from 1-10, it's page 4; from 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages (481-488). Each complete set contributes one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more (page 484). So, total 4's in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. For example, from 1-100, the tens digit is 4 in the range 40-49, which is 10 times.

There are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and an additional 88 pages (401-488). Each hundred contributes 10 times the digit 4 in the tens place, so 4 hundreds would contribute 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for 40-49, but wait, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449. That's 10 pages, so 10 times. So, total 4's in the tens place: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so from 400-488. In this range, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place: Similar to the 4's, in every set of 10 numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, in 488 pages, how many complete sets of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete sets, each contributing one 8, so 48 times. Then, the extra 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (page 488). So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The tens digit is 8 in ranges like 80-89, 180-189, etc. Let's see how many times this happens in 488 pages. Each hundred contributes 10 times the digit 8 in the tens place. So, for 1-100: 80-89 (10 times). 101-200: 180-189 (10 times). 201-300: 280-289 (10 times). 301-400: 380-389 (10 times). That's 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 4*10 = 40 times. Now, in the remaining 88 pages (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8. So, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488. Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488), so the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the range 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 times.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's, subtract the total 8's from the total 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding their difference.\n\n1. **Counting 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets (480 numbers) plus 8 extra pages (481-488). The extra pages contribute one more 4. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). For 400-488, the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, contributing another 10. Total: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages. Total: 89.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers. Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. For 401-488, it appears 9 times. Total: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** 8 does not appear in the hundreds place as the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90.  \n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every 10 consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of 10 numbers, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and then an extra 8 numbers (481-488). So, in each complete set, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 have a 4 in the units place? Yes, 484 ends with a 4. So that's one more 4. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, every block of 100 numbers has 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. For example, from 0-99, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, which is 10 numbers. So, in each 100 numbers, there are 10 4's in the tens place. Now, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 complete hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then an extra 88 numbers (401-488). \n\nIn each complete hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8 in the 400s. So, the tens digit is 4 in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But wait, 488 is only up to 488, so 440-449 is within 401-488, right? So, that's another 10 4's in the tens place. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The extra part is 401-488, which is 88 numbers. The tens digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, in 401-488, how many times does the tens digit equal 4? It would be in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so 10 times. So, that's correct. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 in all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Wait, 49 + 50 is 99, and 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 89 is 188? Wait, 99 + 80 is 179, plus 9 is 188. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's in the page numbers. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, every 10 numbers have one 8 in the units place. So, 488 / 10 is 48.8, so 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the extra 8 numbers (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total 8's in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, every 100 numbers have 10 occurrences of each digit in the tens place. So, from 0-99, the tens digit is 8 in 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in each 100, 10 8's in the tens place. Now, 488 / 100 is 4.88, so 4 complete hundreds, each contributing 10 8's, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit cycles through 0-8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, that's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check that again. In 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-488. So, 480 to 488 is 9 numbers, so 9 times the tens digit is 8. So, yes, 9.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, there are zero 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, that's 49 + 49? Wait, 49 + 49 is 98? Wait, no, 49 + 49 is 98? Wait, 40 + 40 is 80, plus 9 +9 is 18, so 80 + 18 is 98. Yes, correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the extra 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, total 8's in tens place is 40 (from the first 400) plus 9, which is 49. So, 49 in units, 49 in tens, 0 in hundreds, totaling 98.\n\nSo, number of 4's is 188, number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again because sometimes I might have missed something.\n\nWait, for the 4's in the hundreds place, from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 8 from 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's. So, 40 (from 1-400) + 9 = 49 in tens place.\n\nUnits place: 48 complete sets of 10, each contributing one 8, so 48, plus one more in 488, making 49.\n\nSo, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, 4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because when I thought about the 4's in the tens place, I considered 400-488 as the hundreds place, but when counting the tens place, it's in 440-449, which is within 400-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: For each digit place, count how many times 4 appears and how many times 8 appears.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor units digit:\n\nNumber of 4's in units place: floor(488 / 10) + (if the last digit is >=4, add 1). Wait, no, actually, for units digit, it's (n + 9) // 10, where n is the digit we're looking for. Wait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\nIn the units place, for each page number, the digit cycles 0-9 every 10 numbers. So, the number of times a digit d appears in the units place is:\n\nnumber_of_times = (total_pages + 9 - d) // 10\n\nWait, no, maybe it's better to think as:\n\nFor units digit d, the number of times it appears is:\n\ncount = (total_pages // 10) + (1 if (total_pages % 10) >= d else 0)\n\nBut wait, that's for the units digit. Let me test it.\n\nFor d=4, total_pages=488.\n\ncount_units_4 = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=4 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for d=8:\n\ncount_units_8 = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10) >=8 else 0) = 48 + 1 = 49. Correct.\n\nFor tens digit:\n\nThe formula is a bit different. For the tens digit d, the number of times it appears is:\n\ncount = (total_pages // 100) * 10 + extra\n\nWhere extra is the number of times d appears in the tens place in the remaining part.\n\nFor example, for d=4:\n\ntotal_pages = 488.\n\ndivided by 100 is 4, so 4 * 10 = 40.\n\nThen, the remaining is 88 pages. The tens digit is 4 in 40-49 in the last 100, but since we have only 88, we check how many full groups of 10 are there in 88. 88 // 10 = 8, so 8 full groups, each contributing 10 4's? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is:\n\nFor the tens digit, each hundred contributes 10 times the digit in the tens place. So, for 488 pages, we have 4 full hundreds (0-399), each contributing 10 4's in the tens place, so 4*10=40.\n\nThen, in the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, how many times does 4 appear in the tens place here? It's in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. But since we're only going up to 488, 440-449 is fully within 400-488, so that's 10 times. So, total 4's in tens place: 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place:\n\ntotal_pages = 488.\n\ndivided by 100 is 4, so 4*10=40.\n\nIn the remaining 88 pages (400-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nFor the hundreds digit:\n\nFor 4's, the hundreds digit is 4 from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\n\nFor 8's, the hundreds digit would be 8 from 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, there are 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n4's: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Because from 400 to 488 inclusive, that's 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nWait, let me confirm 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, the total number of 4's is 188, and 8's is 98, so 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, 4 appears once (at 4); in 11-20, 4 appears once (at 14), and so on. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the complete sets, plus one more time in the partial set (484). So, units place contributes 49 times 4 appears.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. Similarly, this happens every hundred numbers. So, in each hundred, there's a block of ten where the tens digit is 4. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four hundreds: 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and then 400-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds are 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds (0-99, 100-199, etc.), the tens digit 4 appears 10 times each. So that's 4 times 10, which is 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears from 440-449, which is another 10 times. So, that's 10 more. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50. Wait, but hold on, 400-488: from 400-409, the tens digit is 0, then 410-419 is 1, 420-429 is 2, 430-439 is 3, 440-449 is 4, so that's 10 numbers where tens digit is 4. So yes, 10 more. So total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these 89 numbers. So, that's 89 more 4's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. So total 4's are 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, there are 188 fours printed.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: Similar to the 4's, in each set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488? As before, 48 complete sets and a partial set of 8. So, in the units place, 8 appears 48 times from the complete sets, plus one more in the partial set (488). So, units place contributes 49 times 8 appears.\n\nNext, the tens place: The digit 8 appears in a block of ten numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, each hundred has one such block. So, how many hundreds are there? As before, 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, in each of the first four hundreds, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times. So, that's 4 times 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears from 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, it's only 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 more 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers from 800-899. But wait, the book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, hundreds place contributes 0 8's.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units place is 49, tens place is 49, hundreds place is 0. So total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. For the tens place, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 from the first four hundreds plus 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's are 188, and total 8's are 98. Now, the question is how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting. Let me go through each digit place again for both 4's and 8's.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full decades (1-480) give 48 4's, plus 484, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 4's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds (1-400) give 40, plus 440-449 in the 400-488 range, which is 10 more, totaling 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full decades give 48 8's, plus 488, so 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 hundreds give 40, plus in the 400-488 range, 480-488 gives 9 more, totaling 49.\n- Hundreds: None, since 800-899 is beyond 488.\nTotal: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Units Place:** In each set of ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets (1-480) and one partial set (481-488). So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens Place:** In each hundred, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49). There are 4 complete hundreds (1-400) and an additional 10 in 440-449. So, 4\u00d710 + 10 = 50.\n- **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers.\n- **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Units Place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once per set of ten. There are 48 complete sets and one in 488. So, 48 + 1 = 49.\n- **Tens Place:** In each hundred, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete hundreds and an additional 9 in 480-488. So, 4\u00d710 + 9 = 49.\n- **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n- **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place. In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, the digit 4 appears once in each set of ten. For example, in 1-10, it's the 4th page; in 11-20, it's the 14th page, and so on. Now, how many such sets are there up to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then an additional 8 pages. So, in each of these 48 sets, there's one 4 in the units place, giving 48 times. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 will have a 4 in the units place. That's one more, making the total for units place 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in entire blocks of ten numbers. For example, from 40-49, every number has a 4 in the tens place. Similarly, this happens in 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there? From 0-488, we have four blocks: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block gives 10 4's, so 5 * 10 = 50. But wait, the last block, 440-449, is within 488, so that's fine. So, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. \n\nWait, but let me check: 40-49 is 10 numbers, 140-149 is another 10, 240-249 another 10, 340-349 another 10, and 440-449 another 10. That's five blocks, each with 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. So, 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers from 400-488. Wait, but 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, in each of these numbers, the hundreds digit is 4. So, how many 4's in the hundreds place? It's 89 times. Wait, but let me confirm: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. So, each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's.\n\nWait, but wait, the hundreds digit is only 4 in the numbers 400-488, correct. So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units place is 49, tens place is 50, hundreds place is 89. So, total 4's = 49 + 50 + 89. Let me calculate that: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, moving on to counting the number of 8's. I'll do the same process: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, how many full sets of ten are there up to 488? As before, 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8 in the units place, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 488 will have an 8 in the units place. That's one more, making units place total 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. Wait, but our book only goes up to 488, so 480-488 is part of the last block. Each full block (like 80-89) contributes 10 8's in the tens place. So, how many such blocks are there? Let's see:\n\n- 80-89: 10 numbers\n- 180-189: 10 numbers\n- 280-289: 10 numbers\n- 380-389: 10 numbers\n- 480-488: 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page)\n\nWait, so the first four blocks are complete, each contributing 10 8's, and the last block is 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, the number of 8's in the tens place is 4*10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me double-check: from 80-89, that's 10 numbers, each with an 8 in the tens place. Similarly, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 each contribute 10. Then, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers from 800-899. But our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units place 49, tens place 49, hundreds place 0. So, 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place, 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, that's five blocks. But the first four are full, each with 10, and the fifth is 480-488, which is 9. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the units place again. For units place, in each set of ten, 8 appears once. So, up to 488, how many sets of ten are there? 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1 to 8, so 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding one more, making it 49. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the tens place: as calculated, 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, in 481-488, 484 has a 4 in the units place, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens place: 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 4's, so 5*10=50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 full sets, each with one 8, so 48. Then, 488 adds one more, total 49.\n- Tens place: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. The first four are full, each with 10 8's, so 4*10=40. The last block, 480-488, has 9 numbers, so 9 8's. Total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0, as there are no page numbers beyond 488.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check if I've missed any blocks or miscounted. For example, in the tens place for 4's, I considered 40-49, 140-149, etc., up to 440-449. That's five blocks, correct. Each has 10 numbers, so 5*10=50. That seems right.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place, I considered 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. Let me check again: from 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 89 numbers. Because 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 4's. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to check: for 4's, units place: 49, tens place: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's: units 49, tens 49, so 98. 188 - 98 = 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I count the hundreds place correctly for 4's? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, hundreds place is zero because the book ends at 488, which is less than 800. So, no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. When counting the units place, I considered 48 full sets of ten, each contributing one 4 or 8. But in the case of 4's, the last partial set is 481-488, which includes 484. So, that's correct. Similarly for 8's, the last partial set includes 488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think about the tens place again. For 4's, in the tens place, the blocks are 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, 440-449 is within 488, so that's correct. So, five blocks, each with 10 4's, so 50.\n\nFor 8's, the tens place blocks are 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. So, five blocks, but the last one is only 9 numbers. So, 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just realized something. In the hundreds place, when counting 4's, I included 400-488, which is correct. But for 8's, I didn't include any because there are no page numbers beyond 488. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't double-count or miss any numbers. For example, in the units place, when I count 4's, I included 4, 14, 24, ..., 484. That's correct. Similarly for 8's, I included 8, 18, 28, ..., 488. Correct.\n\nIn the tens place, for 4's, I included 40-49, 140-149, etc., each contributing 10. Correct.\n\nFor 8's, same approach, but the last block is only 9 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo, I think I've covered all cases. Therefore, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit 4 appears once in the units place.\n   - There are 48 full sets of ten (1-480), contributing 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 pages (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc.\n   - There are five such blocks (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - Total in tens place: 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - The digit 4 appears in numbers 400-488.\n   - This range includes 89 numbers, each contributing one 4.\n   - Total in hundreds place: 89.\n\n**Total number of 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, in every set of ten, 8 appears once in the units place.\n   - 48 full sets contribute 48 occurrences.\n   - The remaining 8 pages include 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc.\n   - There are four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389), each contributing 10 occurrences.\n   - The fifth block, 480-488, contributes 9 occurrences.\n   - Total in tens place: 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - There are no page numbers where the hundreds digit is 8 (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total in hundreds place: 0.\n\n**Total number of 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n**Difference:**\n188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14; and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then an extra 8 pages. In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the extra 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That adds one more, making it 49 times in the units place.\n\nNext, for the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each block of 100, the tens digit is 4 for exactly 10 numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there in 488? That's 4 (since 4*100=400, and 5*100=500 which is beyond 488). But wait, up to 488, so the last block is only up to 488. So, for each hundred, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times. So, 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40 times. But wait, the last hundred is only up to 488, so the tens digit 4 in the hundreds place (400-488) would be from 400-488. The tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 times, so that's fine. So, 40 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, actually, the hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place. Wait, no, that's not correct. Each number from 400 to 488 has a hundreds digit of 4, so each of those 89 numbers contributes one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 times.\n\nWait, but let me check that. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a hundreds digit of 4, so yes, 89 times. So, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (40) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 40 = 89; 89 + 89 = 178. Wait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units place: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 pages where 484 adds another, so 49. Tens place: Each hundred has 10 numbers with tens digit 4, so 4 hundreds would give 4*10=40. But wait, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so that's correct. So, 40 in tens place. Hundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89. So total 4's: 49 + 40 + 89 = 178.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Again, I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each block of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus, in the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so page 488 has an 8 in the units place. So, that's one more, making it 49 in the units place.\n\nTens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, how many full hundreds are there? 4, as before. So, 4*10=40 times. But wait, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-489, but since the book only goes up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, instead of 10, it's 9. So, in the tens place, the number of 8's is 4*10=40 for the first three hundreds (1-300), and then 9 in the last hundred (400-488). So total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, that can't be right because when I calculated 4's, I got 178, and 8's as 98, so the difference would be 80. But let me double-check the 8's count.\n\nWait, in the tens place, for each hundred, it's 10 numbers with tens digit 8. So, for the first three hundreds (1-300), that's 3*10=30. Then, in the last hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 30 + 9 = 39 in the tens place. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Wait, no, because in each hundred, the tens digit 8 occurs 10 times, except the last one where it's only 9 times because the book ends at 488. So, for the first three hundreds (1-300), it's 3*10=30. Then, in 400-488, it's 9 times. So total tens place 8's: 30 + 9 = 39. Plus, the units place was 49, so total 8's: 49 + 39 = 88.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49 in units and 49 in tens, making 98. Now, I'm getting 49 in units and 39 in tens, making 88. Which is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. The tens digit 8 occurs in each hundred as 80-89, which is 10 numbers. So, in 1-100: 80-89, 10 numbers. 101-200: 180-189, 10 numbers. 201-300: 280-289, 10 numbers. 301-400: 380-389, 10 numbers. 401-488: 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, in the first four hundreds, the first three have 10 each, and the fourth has 9. So, total tens place 8's: 3*10 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, units place: 49, tens place: 39, hundreds place: 0. So total 8's: 49 + 39 = 88.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the units place was 49. Let me check units place again. Units digit 8 occurs once every 10 numbers. So, from 1 to 488, how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's the same as the number of times 8 is the last digit. So, 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there? The last term is 488, which is 8*61 = 488. So, 61 times. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. I thought it was 48 full blocks of 10, each contributing 1, so 48, plus one more in the last 8 pages, making 49. But actually, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1, so 48, and then in the last partial block (481-488), the units digits go up to 8, so 488 is included, adding one more, making it 49. So, units place 8's: 49.\n\nBut when I thought about it as 8,18,...,488, that's 61 terms. Wait, that can't be right because 8*61=488, but 8*61=488, but 8*60=480, so 488 is 8*61. So, that would mean 61 terms. But that contradicts the earlier count. Hmm, where am I going wrong?\n\nWait, no, because from 1 to 488, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers. So, the number of times 8 appears in the units place is floor(488/10) + 1 if 488 mod 10 >=8. So, floor(488/10)=48, and 488 mod 10=8, which is equal to 8, so we add 1. So total units place 8's: 48 +1=49. So that's correct. So, units place 8's:49.\n\nTens place: As above, 3*10 +9=39.\n\nHundreds place:0.\n\nSo total 8's:49+39=88.\n\nSo, number of 4's:178, number of 8's:88.\n\nSo, the difference is 178-88=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought 178-88=90, but let me confirm.\n\nWait, 178-88=90.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's.\n\nNumber of 4's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:40\n\nHundreds place:89\n\nTotal:49+40=89; 89+89=178.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNumber of 8's:\n\nUnits place:49\n\nTens place:39\n\nHundreds place:0\n\nTotal:49+39=88.\n\nSo, 178-88=90.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the difference was 80, but that was a miscalculation. So, the correct difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's.\n\nWait, from 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers are there? 488-400+1=89 numbers. Each has a hundreds digit of 4, so that's 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, total 4's:49(units)+40(tens)+89(hundreds)=178.\n\nTotal 8's:49(units)+39(tens)=88.\n\nDifference:178-88=90.\n\nSo, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the tens place for 8's. In the last hundred, 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers:480,481,...,488. So, that's 9 times, right? So, for the first three hundreds, each contributes 10, so 3*10=30, plus 9 in the last, making 39.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, I think the final answer is 90.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 178, and the number of 8's is 88. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

Now, how many complete sets of 10 are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of 10 and a partial set of 8 numbers (481-488). In each complete set, we have one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Then, in the partial set from 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, does 484 fall into this range? Yes, 484 is within 481-488, so that's another 4 in the units place. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, let's look at the tens place. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the range x40 to x49, where x is the hundreds digit. For example, in 1-100, it's 40-49; in 101-200, it's 140-149; and so on. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Wait, but 488 is less than 500, so the hundreds digit goes up to 4. So, the blocks would be 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. Let me check each block:\n\n- 0-99: 40-49 \u2192 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place.\n- 100-199: 140-149 \u2192 10 numbers, another 10 4's.\n- 200-299: 240-249 \u2192 10 numbers, another 10 4's.\n- 300-399: 340-349 \u2192 10 numbers, another 10 4's.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 4, so the numbers would be 440-449. But wait, 488 is less than 450, so does 440-449 fall within 400-488? Yes, because 449 is less than 488. So that's another 10 numbers, contributing 10 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but 488 is beyond 449, so the last block is 400-488, which includes 440-449. So, each of these five blocks contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so 5 * 10 = 50. So, total 4's in the tens place are 50.\n\nNow, let's check the hundreds place. The digit 4 in the hundreds place occurs in the numbers 400-488. Each number here has 4 in the hundreds place. So, how many numbers are there from 400 to 488 inclusive? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, each of these 89 numbers contributes a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 4's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. From 400 to 488, the hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers, so yes, 89 numbers, each contributing one 4 in the hundreds place. So, that's 89 4's.\n\nSo, adding up all the 4's: units place (49) + tens place (50) + hundreds place (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's printed are 188.\n\nNow, let's do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with the units place. Similar to the 4's, in each block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles through 0-9, so 8 appears once every 10 numbers. So, in 488 pages, how many complete blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 complete blocks and a partial block of 8 numbers (481-488). Each complete block contributes one 8 in the units place, so 48 times. Then, in the partial block 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8. So, 488 is included, which has an 8 in the units place. So, that's another 1. So, total 8's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place. The digit 8 in the tens place occurs in every block of 100 numbers, specifically in the range x80 to x89, where x is the hundreds digit. For example, in 1-100, it's 80-89; in 101-200, it's 180-189; and so on. Each of these blocks contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 8 in the tens place. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? The hundreds digit can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's check each block:\n\n- 0-99: 80-89 \u2192 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n- 100-199: 180-189 \u2192 10 numbers, another 10 8's.\n- 200-299: 280-289 \u2192 10 numbers, another 10 8's.\n- 300-399: 380-389 \u2192 10 numbers, another 10 8's.\n- 400-488: Here, the tens digit is 8, so the numbers would be 480-489. But 488 is the last page, so we have 480-488. That's 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488), each contributing an 8 in the tens place. So, that's 9 8's instead of 10.\n\nSo, adding up the tens place 8's: 4 blocks of 10 (0-399) contribute 10 each, so 4 * 10 = 40, plus the last partial block contributing 9. So, total 40 + 9 = 49 8's in the tens place.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. The last block is 400-488, and the tens digit is 8, so numbers from 480-488. That's 9 numbers because 488 is the last page, so 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers. So yes, 9 8's in the tens place for the last block.\n\nNow, the hundreds place. The digit 8 in the hundreds place would occur in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me check again. For the tens place, I had 4 blocks contributing 10 each, so 40, and the last block contributing 9, so 49. Units place was 49, so total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but earlier, for 4's, I had 188, and for 8's, 98. So, the difference would be 188 - 98 = 90. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me go through the 8's again, especially the tens place. From 0-99: 80-89 is 10 numbers, so 10 8's in the tens place.\n\nFrom 100-199: 180-189 is another 10, so 10 more.\n\nFrom 200-299: 280-289 is another 10, so 10 more.\n\nFrom 300-399: 380-389 is another 10, so 10 more.\n\nFrom 400-488: 480-488 is 9 numbers, so 9 more.\n\nSo, that's 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 = 49 in the tens place. Units place was 49, so total 8's are 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, for 4's, let me check again.\n\nUnits place: 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full decades, each contributing 1 4 in the units place, so 48. Then, the last 8 pages (481-488) include 484, which adds 1 more, so 49 total in units.\n\nTens place: Each hundred block (0-99, 100-199, etc.) up to 400-488. Each contributes 10 4's in the tens place, except the last block, which is 400-488. Wait, in 400-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, right? Because 449 is less than 488, so yes, 10 numbers, so 10 4's in the tens place for that block. So, from 0-99: 10, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:10. So that's 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50 in the tens place.\n\nHundreds place: 400-488 is 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89.\n\nSo, 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188 4's.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Maybe I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. Each has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's correct.\n\nAnother thing to check: when counting the 8's in the tens place, from 400-488, I had 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, 480,481,...,488 is 9 numbers, right? Because 488 - 480 + 1 = 9. So, that's correct, 9 8's in the tens place for that block.\n\nWait, but let me check the units place for 8's again. 488 pages, so how many times does 8 appear in the units place? It's every 10 pages, so 8,18,28,...,488. How many terms are there in this sequence? The first term is 8, the last term is 488. The common difference is 10. So, the number of terms is ((488 - 8)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, that's correct, 49 8's in the units place.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the units place, it's 4,14,24,...,484. The last term is 484, which is less than 488. So, number of terms is ((484 - 4)/10) + 1 = (480/10) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49. So, correct.\n\nWait, but when I calculated the 4's in the units place, I included 484, which is within 481-488, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the 4's in the tens place. Each hundred block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, right? So, 0-99:40-49, 100-199:140-149, etc., each gives 10. So, 5 blocks, 10 each, so 50. That seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, 8's in the tens place: 0-99:80-89 (10), 100-199:180-189 (10), 200-299:280-289 (10), 300-399:380-389 (10), and 400-488:480-488 (9). So, 4 blocks of 10 and one of 9, totaling 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total 4's: 188, total 8's:98. Difference is 90.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the hundreds place for 8's. Since the book only goes up to 488, there are no pages numbered 800-899, so no 8's in the hundreds place. So, that's correct.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So, the number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** In every block of 10 numbers, '4' appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete blocks (1-480) and a partial block (481-488). Each block contributes 1 '4', totaling 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149). There are 5 such blocks (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), contributing 5 \u00d7 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers (400-488), contributing 89.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 complete blocks and a partial block, contributing 48 + 1 = 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every block of 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189). There are 4 complete blocks and a partial block (480-488), contributing 4 \u00d7 10 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** There are no page numbers with '8' in the hundreds place (800-899 exceeds 488).\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the difference:**\n   - Number of '4's: 188\n   - Number of '8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more '4's printed than '8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such sets are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full sets of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full sets. Now, in the extra 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears in sets of 100. For example, from 40-49, each number has a 4 in the tens place. There are 10 such numbers. How many hundreds are there in 488? Well, 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each of these hundreds contributes 10 instances of 4 in the tens place. So, that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, from 401-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. In this range, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, that's another 10. Wait, but 401-488 includes 400-488? No, actually, 401-488 is part of the 400-488 range. Wait, maybe I should think differently. From 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in the ranges 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Each of these is 10 numbers, so that's 5 sets, each contributing 10 4's. So, 5 * 10 = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 400-488, which is part of the 400's. So, maybe that's correct. So, 5 sets of 10, totaling 50 4's in the tens place.\n\nWait, let me check that again. From 1-100: 40-49 is one set, 10 numbers. From 101-200: 140-149, another 10. From 201-300: 240-249, another 10. From 301-400: 340-349, another 10. From 401-488: 440-449, another 10. That's 5 sets, so 5 * 10 = 50. Yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place from 400-488. Each number here has a 4 in the hundreds place. How many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nWait, let me confirm: 400 is the first, 488 is the last. So, 488 - 400 = 88, plus 1 is 89. So, 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. So, total 4's: 188.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, maybe that's correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. Similarly, I'll check units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: In every set of ten numbers, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full sets of ten are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full sets, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the remaining 8 numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1-8, so 8 appears once. So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in the tens place in sets like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of these is 10 numbers except maybe the last one. Let's see: 80-89 is 10 numbers, 180-189 is another 10, 280-289 another 10, 380-389 another 10, and 480-488 is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). Wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 10 times in the first four sets and 9 times in the last set. So, total tens place 8's: 4 * 10 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, let me check again. From 1-488, the tens digit is 8 in the ranges 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. Each of the first four ranges has 10 numbers, so 4 * 10 = 40. The last range, 480-488, is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 49. So, tens place 8's: 49.\n\nHundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, so 4's total is 188 and 8's total is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the 4's in the hundreds place. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 4's there. Then, in the tens place, I had 50, and units 49. So, 89 + 50 = 139, plus 49 is 188. That seems correct.\n\nFor the 8's, units and tens each have 49, so 98 total. So, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 80-89: 10 numbers, 8's in tens place. Similarly, 180-189: 10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, and 480-488:9. So, 4*10 +9=49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place: 40-49,140-149,240-249,340-349,440-449. That's 5 sets of 10, so 50. Units place: 49, hundreds:89. So, 188 total.\n\nYes, so the difference is 90. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's are printed than 8's in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) for both digits.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - Total sets of 10 in 488 pages: 48 full sets (480 numbers) + 8 extra numbers (481-488).\n   - 48 occurrences from full sets + 1 from extra numbers = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place (e.g., 40-49).\n   - There are 5 such sets (40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449).\n   - 5 sets * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total numbers: 488 - 400 + 1 = 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units Place:**\n   - Similar to 4's, every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - 48 full sets + 1 from extra numbers = 49.\n\n2. **Tens Place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place (e.g., 80-89).\n   - There are 4 full sets (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) and one partial set (480-488 with 9 numbers).\n   - 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds Place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place since the book ends at 488.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the units place. For single-digit numbers, only page 4 has a 4 in the units place. For two-digit numbers, the units place cycles every 10 pages. So, from 10 to 99, every group of 10 pages (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.) will have exactly one 4 in the units place. There are 9 such groups (10-19 up to 90-99), so that's 9 times. But wait, the last page is 488, which is a three-digit number, so I need to check if 488 is included. Wait, 488 is page 488, so the three-digit numbers go up to 488, which is beyond 99. So, for two-digit numbers, from 10 to 99, that's 90 pages, so 9 groups of 10, each contributing one 4 in the units place, so 9 times. Then, for three-digit numbers, from 100 to 488, the units place cycles every 10 pages. How many such groups are there? Let's see: 100-109, 110-119, ..., 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, the last group is 480-488, which is 9 pages. Wait, no, 480-489 would be 10 pages, but since we stop at 488, that's 9 pages. So, how many complete groups of 10 are there? From 100 to 480, that's 380 pages (since 480 - 100 + 1 = 381, but I'm considering groups of 10). Wait, maybe it's better to calculate the number of complete decades. From 100 to 480, that's 381 pages, which is 38 full decades (380 pages) and one extra page (481). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. From 100 to 480, how many decades? Each decade is 10 pages. So, 480 - 100 = 380, so 38 decades. Each decade contributes one 4 in the units place, so 38 times. Then, from 481 to 488, that's 8 pages, so the units digit cycles from 1 to 8. So, in 481-488, the units digit 4 appears once (at 484). So, total for three-digit numbers in units place: 38 + 1 = 39. So, total 4's in units place: single-digit (1) + two-digit (9) + three-digit (39) = 1 + 9 + 39 = 49.\n\nNow, let's count the number of times 4 appears in the tens place. For single-digit numbers, there's no tens place, so zero. For two-digit numbers, the tens place can be 4, which would be pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 10 times the digit 4 appears in the tens place. For three-digit numbers, the tens place can be 4. So, in the hundreds place, we have 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's consider each case:\n\n- Hundreds digit 1: The tens digit can be 4, so pages 140-149. That's 10 pages, so 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 2: Similarly, pages 240-249: 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 3: Pages 340-349: 10 times.\n- Hundreds digit 4: Pages 440-449. But wait, our book goes up to 488, so pages 440-449 are all included. That's another 10 times.\n\nSo, for three-digit numbers, the tens place 4 appears 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 times. So, total 4's in tens place: two-digit (10) + three-digit (40) = 50.\n\nNext, the hundreds place. For single-digit and two-digit numbers, the hundreds digit is zero, so no 4's there. For three-digit numbers, the hundreds digit can be 4, which would be pages 400-488. How many pages is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 pages, meaning 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Units: 49, tens: 50, hundreds: 89. So, 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188. Hmm, that seems high. Let me double-check each part.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Single-digit: 1 (page 4)\n- Two-digit: 9 (pages 14,24,...,94)\n- Three-digit: from 100-488. How many times does 4 appear in the units place? For each hundred, 10 times, so from 100-399, that's 3 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 30. Then from 400-488, how many units digits 4? Pages 404, 414, ..., 484. Let's see, from 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs every 10 pages. The first is 404, then 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times. So, total units place 4's: 1 + 9 + (30 + 9) = 1 + 9 + 39 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Two-digit: 40-49: 10 times\n- Three-digit: for hundreds digits 1,2,3,4, each contributes 10 times in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds, each 10, so 40 times. Total tens place 4's: 10 + 40 = 50.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Only in three-digit numbers where hundreds digit is 4: pages 400-488. That's 89 pages, so 89 times.\n\nSo, 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place:\n\n- Single-digit: page 8. So, 1 time.\n- Two-digit: pages 18,28,...,98. That's 9 times (since 18 to 98, stepping by 10, so 9 numbers).\n- Three-digit: from 100-488. Each hundred contributes 10 times in the units place. So, 100-199: 10 times (108,118,...,198)\n200-299: 10 times\n300-399: 10 times\n400-488: how many? Pages 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 times because 488 is included. So, total units place 8's: 1 (single) + 9 (two-digit) + (10 +10 +10 +9) = 1 +9 +39=49.\n\nWait, 100-199:10, 200-299:10, 300-399:10, 400-488:9. So, 10+10+10+9=39. Then, single-digit:1, two-digit:9. So, total units place 8's:1+9+39=49.\n\nTens place:\n\n- Two-digit: pages 80-89. That's 10 times.\n- Three-digit: hundreds digits 1,2,3,4. For each, the tens digit 8 occurs once per hundred. So, 180-189:10, 280-289:10, 380-389:10, 480-489: but our book ends at 488, so 480-488:9 pages. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8, so pages 480-489 would have tens digit 8, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 pages. But actually, the tens digit is 8 regardless of the units digit. So, in 480-489, the tens digit is 8 for all 10 pages, but since we only go up to 488, it's 9 pages. Wait, no, the tens digit is 8 for the entire range, so even if the units digit is 0-8, the tens digit is still 8. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages (480-488), but actually, it's 9 pages, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, in 480-488, the tens digit is 8 for 9 pages. So, for three-digit numbers, the tens digit 8 occurs:\n\n- 180-189:10\n- 280-289:10\n- 380-389:10\n- 480-488:9\n\nSo, total tens place 8's:10+10+10+9=39.\n\nSo, total tens place 8's: two-digit (10) + three-digit (39) = 49.\n\nHundreds place:\n\n- Only in three-digit numbers where hundreds digit is 8. But our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit can be 1,2,3,4. So, there are no page numbers with hundreds digit 8. Therefore, hundreds place 8's: 0.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Units place:49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, when counting the hundreds place for 4's, I had 89 pages from 400-488, which is correct because 488 - 400 +1 = 89. So, 89 times 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nFor 8's, in the hundreds place, there are none because the book doesn't go beyond 488, so no 800-899 pages. So, 0.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's, I had 50, which seems correct: 10 from two-digit, 40 from three-digit.\n\nIn the units place for 4's:49, which seems correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 8's, units and tens each had 49, so 98 total.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I feel like that's a big difference. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I overcounted the hundreds place for 4's. Let me recount the hundreds place for 4's. From 400 to 488, inclusive. So, 488 - 400 +1 = 89 pages. So, each of these pages has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 89 times.\n\nSimilarly, for the tens place, 4's: in two-digit numbers, 40-49:10. In three-digit numbers, for each hundred (1,2,3,4), the tens digit 4 occurs 10 times each. So, 4 hundreds, each 10, so 40. So, 10+40=50.\n\nUnits place: 49, as before.\n\nSo, 49+50+89=188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\nUnits:49, tens:49, hundreds:0. So, 98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten numbers, like 1-10, 11-20, etc., the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets of ten and an additional 8 numbers (481-488). In each of these 48 sets, the units digit 4 appears once, so that's 48 times. Then, in the last partial set (481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (484). So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: Similarly, in every set of a hundred numbers, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers. For example, in 40-49, the tens digit is 4 for all ten numbers. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place. Now, how many hundreds are there in 488? Well, from 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. So, that's five sets, but actually, each hundred block is 100 numbers. Let me think again: from 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, the first four blocks are complete hundreds, and the last is partial. For each complete hundred, there are 10 4's in the tens place. So, 4 hundreds x 10 = 40. Then, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 4 appears in 440-449, which is another 10 numbers. So, that's 10 more. So, total 4's in the tens place are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the numbers 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these numbers, so how many numbers are there from 400 to 488? That's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99; 99 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 4's in total.\n\nNow, let me do the same for the digit 8. I'll go through units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nStarting with units place: As before, in every set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of ten and a partial set of 8 numbers. So, 48 times in the units place from the complete sets, and once in the partial set (488). So, 48 + 1 = 49 8's in the units place.\n\nNext, tens place: In each set of a hundred, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for ten consecutive numbers, like 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each hundred, there are 10 occurrences. Now, how many complete hundreds are there? From 0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, and 400-488. So, four complete hundreds and a partial. Each complete hundred gives 10 8's in the tens place, so 4 x 10 = 40. In the partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 appears in 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, no, 480-489 would be ten numbers, but since the book stops at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, ..., 488. So, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times here. So, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in the numbers 800-899, but since the book ends at 488, there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, 0 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. For the tens place, in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 would be in 480-489, but since the book stops at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 8's in the tens place. So, 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems right.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me check again. When considering the tens place in the last partial hundred (400-488), the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488. How many numbers is that? From 480 to 488, inclusive, that's 9 numbers. So, the tens digit is 8 in 9 of them. So, 9 8's in the tens place from the last partial hundred. So, 40 (from the four complete hundreds) + 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but I'm now confused because in the units place, the 8's are 49, and in the tens place, it's 49, so total 98 8's. But let me check again.\n\nWait, no, when I did the units place, I considered each set of ten, and in the partial set, 481-488, the units digit 8 appears once at 488. So, that's correct: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor the tens place, each hundred has 10 8's in the tens place. There are four complete hundreds (0-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399), each contributing 10, so 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. So, 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nWait, but I'm now thinking that in the hundreds place, since 800-899 isn't part of the book, there are zero 8's there. So, total 8's are 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in counting. Let me go through each digit place again.\n\nFor 4's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of ten (each contributing 1) = 48, plus 1 in 484, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds (each contributing 10) = 40, plus 10 in 440-449, so 50.\n- Hundreds place: 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's:\n\n- Units place: 48 complete sets of ten = 48, plus 1 in 488, so 49.\n- Tens place: 4 complete hundreds = 40, plus 9 in 480-488, so 49.\n- Hundreds place: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference between their counts.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the Digit 4:**\n   - **Units Place:** In each set of 10 numbers, 4 appears once. There are 48 complete sets (1-480) and one partial set (481-488). Thus, 48 + 1 = 49 occurrences.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each set of 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 complete sets (1-400) and one partial set (400-488), contributing 10 each. Thus, 40 + 10 = 50 occurrences.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** From 400-488, 4 appears in the hundreds place for 89 numbers.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the Digit 8:**\n   - **Units Place:** Similar to 4, 8 appears once per set of 10. There are 48 complete sets and one in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens Place:** In each set of 100, 8 appears 10 times. Four complete sets contribute 40, and in 400-488, 8 appears 9 times (480-488), totaling 49.\n   - **Hundreds Place:** No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Calculating the Difference:**\n   - Number of 4's: 188\n   - Number of 8's: 98\n   - Difference: 188 - 98 = 90\n\n**Answer:** There are 90 more 4's than 8's printed in the book.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. Now, how many such sets are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then an extra 8 pages. But wait, since we're counting units digits, each full set of ten contributes one 4. So, 48 sets contribute 48 fours. Then, in the remaining 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes from 1 to 8, so 484 is included, which adds another 4. So, total 4's in the units place would be 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers. In each hundred, the tens digit is 4 for exactly ten numbers: 40-49, 140-149, etc. So, how many hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), and then 401-488. Each of the first four hundreds contributes 10 fours in the tens place. So that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 4 for 40-49, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-410. Wait, no, actually, 401-410 would have tens digit 0, and 410-419 would have tens digit 1, and so on. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The tens digit is 4 for numbers where the tens place is 4, regardless of the hundreds. So, in 400-499, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, but wait, no, the tens digit being 4 would be 400-409 (tens digit 0), 410-419 (tens digit 1), ..., 440-449 (tens digit 4), etc. So, in the range 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is ten numbers. So, that's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, total fours in the tens place would be 40 (from the first four hundreds) + 10 (from 440-449) = 50. Wait, but 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's correct. So, 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400 to 488. So, how many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n\nSo, total number of fours is units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to fours, in each set of ten, the units digit is 8 once. So, how many full tens are there in 488? 48 full tens, as before, and then 8 extra pages. Each full ten contributes 1 eight, so 48 eights. In the last 8 pages (481-488), the units digit goes up to 8, so 488 is included, which adds another eight. So, total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, in each hundred, the tens digit is 8 for ten numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400), each contributing 10 eights in the tens place. So, 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for 480-489. But since the book ends at 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, total eights in the tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488. So, there are no eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of eights is units (49) + tens (49) = 98.\n\nNow, subtract the number of eights from the number of fours: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor fours:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus the last 8 pages include 484, so +1, total 49.\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so 4 hundreds *10=40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 numbers, so +10, total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488 is 89 numbers, so +89.\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 +89= 188.\n\nFor eights:\n- Units: 48 full tens, +1 in the last 8 pages, total 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds *10=40, plus in 401-488, 480-488 is 9 numbers, so +9, total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal eights: 49 +49=98.\n\nDifference: 188 -98=90.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, there are 90 more fours than eights.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n1. **Counting the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** Each set of ten numbers contributes one 4. There are 48 full sets (480 numbers) and one extra set (481-488), contributing 49 fours.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes ten 4's. There are four full hundreds (400 numbers) and an additional ten 4's in 440-449, totaling 50 fours.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, there are 89 numbers, contributing 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Each set of ten contributes one 8. There are 48 full sets and one extra set (481-488), contributing 49 eights.\n   - **Tens place:** Each hundred contributes ten 8's. There are four full hundreds and an additional nine 8's in 480-488, totaling 49 eights.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, 4, 14, 24, ..., up to 484. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times from the full groups, and then in the extra numbers, 484 is one of them, so that's one more. So, units place 4's: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nNext, the tens place: Here, the digit 4 appears in a block of ten numbers. For example, 40-49, 140-149, ..., up to 440-449. Each such block contributes 10 occurrences of the digit 4 in the tens place. How many such blocks are there? Well, from 1 to 488, the hundreds digit can be 0 (for 1-99), 1 (100-199), 2 (200-299), 3 (300-399), or 4 (400-488). So, the tens digit 4 occurs in each hundred block. Let's see: 40-49 is one block, then 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, and 440-449. Wait, but 440-449 is within 488, so that's five blocks. Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5 blocks \u00d7 10 = 50 times. But wait, 440-449 is the last block, but 440-449 is only 10 numbers, right? So, yes, 5 blocks, each with 10 4's. So, tens place 4's: 50 times.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 400-488. So, how many numbers is that? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). But wait, each of these numbers has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 occurrences. Wait, but actually, each page number from 400 to 488 has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 times. So, hundreds place 4's: 89 times.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check that again. From 400 to 488, inclusive, that's 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, yes, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188 times.\n\nWait, let me add that again: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) = 99, plus 89 (hundreds) = 188. Okay, that seems right.\n\nNow, let me count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each group of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many full groups of ten are there? 48 full groups (since 488 \u00f7 10 = 48.8). So, 48 times from the full groups. Then, the extra 8 numbers: 481-488. The units digit in these is 1-8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n\nTens place: The digit 8 appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-489. But since the book only goes up to 488, the last block is 480-488. So, how many such blocks? Let's see: 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389, and 480-488. That's 5 blocks. Each of the first four blocks contributes 10 8's in the tens place, but the last block, 480-488, only has 9 numbers (480 to 488 is 9 numbers: 480,481,...,488). Wait, no: 480 to 488 is 9 numbers? Wait, 488 - 480 = 8, so 8+1=9 numbers. So, in the tens place, the digit 8 appears 10 times in each of the first four blocks (80-89, etc.), and 9 times in the last block (480-488). So, total tens place 8's: 4\u00d710 + 9 = 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Each block from 80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389 has 10 numbers, each contributing an 8 in the tens place, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, 480-488 is the next block, but since 488 is the last page, it only goes up to 488, so that's 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times the 8 in the tens place. So, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49 times.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The digit 8 appears in the hundreds place for numbers 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no page numbers with 8 in the hundreds place. So, hundreds place 8's: 0 times.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98 times.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check. Units place: 49, tens place:49, hundreds:0. So, 49+49=98. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, but wait a second, when counting the tens place for 8's, I considered 480-488 as a block, but actually, 480 is part of the 400-488 range, which is in the hundreds. So, in the tens place, 480-488 would have 8 in the tens place for 480,481,...,488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 times the 8 in the tens place. So, that seems correct.\n\nSo, total 8's: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the number of 4's was 188, and the number of 8's is 98. So, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 4's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times. Let me think: For each ten numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. From 1-488, there are 48 full tens (1-10, 11-20, ..., 481-490, but wait, 488 is less than 490, so the last full ten is 481-490, but 488 is within that. Wait, no, 488 is the last page, so the last full ten would be 481-490, but since 488 is the last, the units digit 4 appears in 484, which is within 481-488. So, yes, 48 full tens, each contributing one 4 in units place, plus one more in the partial ten (484), so 49.\n\n- Tens place: 50 times. As I thought, 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. That's five blocks, each with 10 4's in the tens place. So, 5\u00d710=50. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 89 times. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each with a 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nTotal 4's: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nNow, 8's:\n\n- Units place: 49 times. Each ten has one 8 in units place, 48 full tens, plus 488, which adds one more. So, 49. Correct.\n\n- Tens place: 49 times. Four full blocks (80-89, 180-189, 280-289, 380-389) each contributing 10 8's, so 4\u00d710=40. Then, the partial block 480-488 contributes 9 8's in the tens place (480-488). So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n\n- Hundreds place: 0 times, since the book doesn't go beyond 488. Correct.\n\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nSo, the difference is 188 - 98 = 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's printed.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the hundreds place for 4's. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, 89 times the digit 4 appears in the hundreds place. That seems correct.\n\nAnd for the tens place of 4's, 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. Units place, 49.\n\nYes, so 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nFor 8's, units place 49, tens place 49, so 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the answer is 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book and finding the difference.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** For every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. There are 48 full decades (1-480) and 8 extra numbers (481-488). Thus, '4' appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '4' appears in blocks like 40-49, 140-149, etc. There are 5 such blocks, each contributing 10 '4's, totaling 50 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears once every 10 numbers. There are 48 full decades and one extra in 488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** '8' appears in blocks like 80-89, 180-189, etc. There are 4 full blocks contributing 10 each, and 9 in 480-488, totaling 49 times.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No '8's since the book ends at 488.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The digit '4' appears 90 times more than the digit '8' in the page numbers. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every block of 10 numbers, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each block of 10, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's page 4; in 11-20, it's page 14, and so on. Now, how many such blocks are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a block, we'll consider 48 full blocks and then the remaining 8 pages. Each full block contributes 1 four in the units place, so 48 blocks give us 48 fours. Now, the remaining 8 pages (from 481 to 488) will have their units digits as 1-8. So, page 484 has a 4 in the units place. That adds 1 more four. So, total fours in the units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, for the tens place: Similarly, in every block of 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles through 0-9 for each hundred. So, in each block of 100, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. For example, in 1-100, the tens digit is 4 for pages 40-49. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 fours in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40 fours. Now, the remaining pages are 401-488. Here, the tens digit is 0-8 in the 400s. So, from 401-409, the tens digit is 0, 410-419 is 1, and so on up to 480-488, which is 8. Wait, but in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but the hundreds digit is fixed at 4. So, in the 400s, the tens digit is 4 for pages 440-449. That's another 10 fours in the tens place. So, adding that, we have 40 + 10 = 50 fours in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for pages 400-488. So, how many numbers are there from 400-488? That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). Each of these has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's 89 fours.\n\nWait, but wait, 400-488 is 89 numbers, right? Let me check: 488 - 400 = 88, so adding 1 gives 89. So, 89 fours in the hundreds place.\n\nNow, adding up all the fours: units (49) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, plus 89 is 188 fours.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the hundreds place. Wait, in the hundreds place, from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, so that's indeed 89 fours. But let me check the tens and units again.\n\nFor units: 48 full tens blocks (1-480), each contributing 1 four in units, so 48. Then, 481-488: pages 484 has a 4 in units, so 1 more, total 49. That seems correct.\n\nFor tens: 4 full hundreds (1-400), each contributing 10 fours in tens place, so 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit is 4 for 440-449, which is 10 more fours, so total 50. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with units place: In each block of 10, the units digit is 8 once. So, from 1-488, how many full blocks of 10 are there? 488 / 10 = 48.8, so 48 full blocks, each contributing 1 eight in units, so 48 eights. Then, the remaining 8 pages (481-488) have units digits from 1-8. So, page 488 has an 8 in the units place, adding 1 more. So, total eights in units place: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, tens place: In each block of 100, the tens digit is 8 for 10 numbers: 80-89, 180-189, etc. So, in each block of 100, 10 eights in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each contributes 10 eights, so 4 * 10 = 40 eights. Now, in the 400s (401-488), the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488. That's 9 pages (480-488), but wait, 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. Wait, but from 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, that's 9 eights. So, total eights in tens place: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no eights in the hundreds place. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up the eights: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 98 eights.\n\nWait, let me check the tens place again. In the 400s, the tens digit is 8 for 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. But in each full hundred before that, it's 10 eights. So, 4 * 10 = 40, plus 9 = 49. That seems correct.\n\nSo, total eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check my counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCounting fours:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 four: 48. Plus 484: 1 more. Total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 fours: 40. Plus 440-449: 10 fours. Total 50.\n- Hundreds: 400-488: 89 fours.\n\nTotal fours: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\nCounting eights:\n\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1 eight: 48. Plus 488: 1 more. Total 49.\n- Tens: 4 full hundreds, each contributing 10 eights: 40. Plus 480-488: 9 eights. Total 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\n\nTotal eights: 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, but I'm wondering if I counted correctly in the hundreds place for fours. From 400-488, that's 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place, so 89 fours. That seems correct.\n\nWait, another way to check: Let's calculate the number of fours and eights in each digit place.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use a formula or a more systematic approach.\n\nFor a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds), the number of times a digit d appears can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor units place:\nNumber of full cycles = total numbers // 10\nRemaining numbers = total numbers % 10\nCount = full cycles * 1 (since each cycle contributes once)\nIf the remaining numbers > d, add 1, else add 0 if d > remaining.\n\nWait, but this is for digits 0-9. Let me try applying this formula.\n\nWait, actually, for units digit, the formula is:\n\ncount_units(d) = (n // 10) * 1 + min(max(n % 10 - d, 0), 1)\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, for units digit:\n\nNumber of times d appears in units place up to n is floor((n + 1) / 10) * 1 + ( (n + 1) % 10 > d ? 1 : 0 )\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's better to think as:\n\nIn each group of 10 numbers, the digit d appears exactly once in the units place. So, for n = 488, the number of times d appears in units place is (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10 >= d) else 0). Wait, but if d is 0, it's a bit different because 0 doesn't appear in the units place of numbers less than 10.\n\nBut in our case, d is 4 and 8, which are non-zero, so the formula would be:\n\ncount_units = (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10 >= 4) else 0) for 4.\n\nSimilarly for 8: (488 // 10) + (1 if (488 % 10 >= 8) else 0).\n\nSo, for 4:\n\ncount_units_4 = 48 + (8 >= 4) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nFor 8:\n\ncount_units_8 = 48 + (8 >= 8) = 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nThat matches our earlier count.\n\nFor tens place:\n\nThe formula is a bit more involved. For the tens digit, each digit d appears in the tens place in blocks of 100. Each block contributes 10 times the digit d in the tens place. Additionally, there might be a partial block.\n\nSo, count_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + extra, where extra depends on the tens digit.\n\nSpecifically, if the tens digit of n is greater than or equal to d, then extra is 10 if the tens digit is exactly d, otherwise it's (tens digit - d + 1) * 10? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think as:\n\nLet me consider the tens digit. For each hundred, the tens digit cycles from 0-9 ten times. So, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place.\n\nNow, for numbers beyond the full hundreds, say, the last partial hundred, the tens digit can be from 0 up to the tens digit of n.\n\nSo, for example, if n is 488, the full hundreds are 4 (since 4*100=400), and the remaining is 88. The tens digit in the remaining part is 8 (since 88 is in the 80-89 range).\n\nSo, for digit d in the tens place:\n\ncount_tens = (full_hundreds) * 10 + (if the tens digit of n >= d, then 10 if the tens digit is exactly d, else (tens_digit - d + 1) * 10? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to see how many complete tens blocks there are beyond the full hundreds.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is:\n\ncount_tens = (n // 100) * 10 + (if (n % 100) >= (d * 10) then 10 else 0)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think differently.\n\nFor the tens digit, each time the tens digit is d, it contributes 10 numbers (e.g., d0-d9). So, for each hundred, the digit d appears 10 times in the tens place. So, for 488, the number of full hundreds is 4 (since 4*100=400). So, 4*10=40 times for each digit d in the tens place.\n\nNow, for the remaining 88 numbers (401-488), the tens digit can be from 0 to 8. So, for each digit d in 0-8, how many times does it appear in the tens place?\n\nIf d is less than or equal to 8, then in the remaining 88 numbers, the tens digit d appears once in the tens place for each hundred. Wait, but 88 is less than 100, so the tens digit goes up to 8.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate how many times each digit appears in the tens place beyond the full hundreds.\n\nFor example, in 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 (401-410), 1 (411-420), ..., up to 8 (481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488, which is 8 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them.\n\nWait, but each tens digit from 0 to 8 appears exactly once in the 400s, but the number of times depends on how many numbers are in that tens group.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of times each digit appears in the tens place beyond the full hundreds.\n\nSo, for the tens digit in 401-488:\n\n- The tens digit 0 appears from 401-410: 10 numbers, but since we're starting at 401, it's 401-410, which is 10 numbers, so the tens digit 0 appears 10 times.\n\n- Similarly, tens digit 1 appears from 411-420: 10 numbers.\n\n- ...\n\n- Tens digit 8 appears from 481-490, but since we only go up to 488, it's 481-488: 8 numbers.\n\nSo, for each digit d from 0 to 7, the tens digit appears 10 times in the 400s, and for d=8, it appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because 401-410 is 10 numbers, but 481-488 is only 8 numbers. So, for digits 0-7, the tens digit appears 10 times each in the 400s, and for 8, it appears 8 times.\n\nWait, but that's only if the hundreds are full. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that in the 400s, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but the last group (tens digit 8) is incomplete.\n\nSo, for digit d in the tens place beyond the full hundreds:\n\nIf d < 8, then it appears 10 times.\n\nIf d = 8, it appears 8 times.\n\nSo, for 4's in the tens place beyond the full hundreds:\n\nd=4, so in the 400s, the tens digit 4 appears 10 times (from 440-449).\n\nSimilarly, for 8's in the tens place beyond the full hundreds:\n\nd=8, so it appears 8 times (from 480-488).\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 4*10 (from full hundreds) + 10 (from 400s) = 50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 4*10 (from full hundreds) + 8 (from 400s) = 48.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 49 eights in tens place. Hmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no, in my initial count, I had 4*10=40 eights in the tens place from the first 400 pages, and then in the 400s, from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9 eights. So, total 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nBut according to this formula, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears 8 times, not 9. So, which is correct?\n\nWait, 480-488 is 9 numbers: 480, 481, 482, 483, 484, 485, 486, 487, 488. So, 9 numbers, each with tens digit 8. So, that's 9 eights in the tens place. So, my initial count was correct: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but according to the formula I just thought of, for d=8 in the tens place beyond the full hundreds, it should be 8 times. But that's not matching. So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula should consider that the remaining numbers after the full hundreds are 88 (488 - 400 = 88). So, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, and for each digit d, the number of times it appears in the tens place is:\n\nIf the remaining numbers are >= 10*(d+1), then 10 times.\n\nOtherwise, it's (remaining numbers // 10) + 1 if the remaining numbers % 10 > d.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to manually check.\n\nIn the 400s, from 400-488, the tens digits go from 0 (400-409) up to 8 (480-488). So, for each tens digit d:\n\n- d=0: 400-409: 10 numbers\n- d=1: 410-419: 10 numbers\n- ...\n- d=7: 470-479: 10 numbers\n- d=8: 480-488: 9 numbers\n\nSo, for d=8, it's 9 numbers, hence 9 eights in the tens place.\n\nTherefore, in the 400s, the tens digit 8 appears 9 times, not 8. So, my initial count of 9 eights in the tens place beyond the full hundreds was correct, leading to a total of 40 + 9 = 49 eights in the tens place.\n\nSo, the formula I thought of earlier was incorrect because it didn't account for the fact that the last group might have more than 10 numbers if the remaining count is more than 10*(d+1). So, better to stick with the manual count.\n\nSimilarly, for fours in the tens place beyond the full hundreds, it's 10 times because 440-449 is a full group of 10.\n\nSo, total fours in tens place: 4*10 + 10 = 50.\n\nTotal eights in tens place: 4*10 + 9 = 49.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nNow, hundreds place:\n\nFor fours, from 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place. So, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers, so 89 fours.\n\nFor eights, since the book only goes up to 488, there are no numbers where the hundreds digit is 8. So, 0 eights in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total fours: 49 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = 188.\n\nTotal eights: 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = 98.\n\nDifference: 188 - 98 = 90.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the number of fours printed is 90 more than the number of eights.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 90 more than the number of 8's.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Count the number of 4's:**\n   - **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, 4 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full groups of 10 in 488, contributing 48 fours. The remaining 8 numbers (481-488) include 484, adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. There are 4 full groups of 100, contributing 40 fours. In the 400s (401-488), 440-449 adds 10 more. Total: 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, each number has a 4 in the hundreds place, totaling 89 fours.\n   - **Total 4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Count the number of 8's:**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to 4's, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, with 48 full groups and 488 adding 1 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, 8 appears 10 times. There are 4 full groups, contributing 40. In the 400s, 480-488 adds 9 more. Total: 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** No 8's since the book ends at 488. Total: 0.\n   - **Total 8's:** 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference:**\n   - Number of 4's - Number of 8's = 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 90. So, the final answer is \\boxed{90}."

    "text": " \n\nFirst, for the units place: In every set of ten consecutive numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. Now, how many such sets are there from 1 to 488? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, so there are 48 full sets of ten and then a partial set from 481 to 488. So, in the units place, the number of 4's is 48 times 1, which is 48. But wait, in the partial set from 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 doesn't appear here. So, total units place 4's: 48.\n\nNext, for the tens place: Similarly, in each set of a hundred numbers, the digit in the tens place cycles through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1 to 488, there are 4 full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 more pages (401-488). So, for each hundred, 10 times 4's in the tens place, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, in the tens place, the digit 4 appears once in 440-449, which is 10 times. Wait, no, actually, the tens digit is 4 for the entire block 440-449, so that's 10 occurrences. So, total tens place 4's: 40 (from the four hundreds) plus 10 (from 401-488) equals 50.\n\nNow, for the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. So, how many times does 4 appear in the hundreds place? From 400 to 488, that's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, the hundreds digit is 4 for each of these 89 numbers. Therefore, 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: units (48) + tens (50) + hundreds (89) = 48 + 50 is 98, plus 89 is 187. So, 187 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: As before, in each set of ten numbers, the units digit 8 appears once. There are 48 full sets of ten and a partial set from 481-488. So, 48 times 1 is 48. In the partial set, units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once (at 488). So, total units place 8's: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: In each hundred, the tens digit cycles 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the tens place. From 1-400, that's four hundreds, so 4 times 10 is 40. Now, in the 401-488 range, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. So, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since our range ends at 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 occurrences of 8 in the tens place. Therefore, total tens place 8's: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the number is between 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place. So, 0.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: units (49) + tens (49) + hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 187 (4's) - 98 (8's) = 89.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48\n- Tens: 50\n- Hundreds: 89\nTotal: 48 + 50 = 98; 98 + 89 = 187. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full tens, each contributing 1, so 48, plus 1 in 488, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40, plus in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 numbers, so 9. Total 40 + 9 = 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal 8's: 49 + 49 = 98. That seems correct.\n\nSo, 187 - 98 = 89. So, there are 89 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me check the tens place for 8's again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but since we only go up to 488, that's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, 9 times, correct. So, 40 (from the four hundreds) + 9 = 49. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for 4's in the tens place, from 1-488, the tens digit is 4 in 40-49, 140-149, 240-249, 340-349, 440-449. Each of these blocks contributes 10 numbers, so 5 blocks, each contributing 10, so 50. That's correct.\n\nAnd for hundreds place, 400-488: 89 numbers, so 89 4's. Correct.\n\nSo, yeah, I think my calculation is correct. So, the answer is 89 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many more 4's than 8's are printed in the page numbers of a 488-page book, we analyze each digit position (units, tens, hundreds) separately.\n\n**Counting the number of 4's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 4.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10 in 480, and the last 8 numbers (481-488) don't add a 4.\n   - Total: 48.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: The tens digit is 4 in 440-449, contributing 10.\n   - Total: 40 + 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - From 400-488: 89 numbers, each contributing a 4 in the hundreds place.\n   - Total: 89.\n\n**Total 4's:** 48 (units) + 50 (tens) + 89 (hundreds) = **187**.\n\n**Counting the number of 8's:**\n\n1. **Units place:**\n   - Every 10 numbers contribute 1 occurrence of 8.\n   - There are 48 full sets of 10, contributing 48.\n   - The last 8 numbers (481-488) include 488, adding 1 more.\n   - Total: 48 + 1 = 49.\n\n2. **Tens place:**\n   - Every 100 numbers contribute 10 occurrences of 8 in the tens place.\n   - From 1-400: 4 sets of 100, contributing 4 \u00d7 10 = 40.\n   - From 401-488: The tens digit is 8 in 480-488, contributing 9.\n   - Total: 40 + 9 = 49.\n\n3. **Hundreds place:**\n   - No page numbers have 8 in the hundreds place (since the book ends at 488).\n   - Total: 0.\n\n**Total 8's:** 49 (units) + 49 (tens) + 0 (hundreds) = **98**.\n\n**Difference:**\n187 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = **89**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{89}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every block of 10 numbers (like 1-10, 11-20, etc.), the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. So, from 1 to 488, how many such blocks are there? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full blocks of 10 and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). In each full block, there's one 4 in the units place, so that's 48 times. Now, in the extra numbers (481-488), the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 4 appears once more. So, total 4's in the units place are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for every block of 100 numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 40-49, 140-149, etc.). So, how many full blocks of 100 do we have? 488 divided by 100 is 4.88, so 4 full blocks (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400). Each block contributes 10 4's in the tens place, so that's 4 * 10 = 40. Now, the last partial block is 401-488. In this range, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. Wait, but our last page is 488, so the tens digit in the last partial block is 8 for 480-488. But since we're looking for 4's in the tens place, in 401-488, the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, etc., up to 8 for 481-488. So, the tens digit is 4 in the range 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so 10 4's. Therefore, total 4's in the tens place are 40 (from full blocks) + 10 (from the last partial block) = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: For the hundreds digit, 4 appears in the hundreds place for all numbers from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, that's 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 = 99, 99 + 89 = 188. So, total number of 4's is 188.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking each digit place.\n\nUnits place: For every block of 10, 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 full blocks (1-480) and then 8 extra numbers (481-488). So, 48 * 1 = 48, plus 1 more in 488, so total 49 8's in the units place.\n\nTens place: For every block of 100, 8 appears 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89, 180-189, etc.). There are 4 full blocks, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial block (401-488), the tens digit is 8 in 480-489, but our last page is 488, so it's 480-488, which is 9 numbers. So, in the tens place, 8 appears 9 times. Therefore, total 8's in the tens place are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800 onwards, but our book only goes up to 488, so there are no 8's in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding them up: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 = 98. So, total number of 8's is 98.\n\nFinally, subtract the number of 8's from the number of 4's: 188 - 98 = 90.

    "num_tokens": 5378,
    "hit_max_tokens": false,
    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit page numbers (1-9): The digit 4 appears once, in page 4. So, that's 1 occurrence. The digit 8 appears once, in page 8. So, 1 occurrence as well. So, in single-digit pages, 4 and 8 each appear once. Now, moving on to two-digit page numbers (10-99). Let's break this into tens and units place. \n\nFor the tens place: The tens digit can be from 1 to 9. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 40-49. That's 10 pages, so 10 occurrences of 4. Similarly, the digit 8 appears in the tens place for pages 80-89, which is another 10 pages, so 10 occurrences. \n\nFor the units place: In the units place, each digit from 0-9 appears equally in each set of ten pages. So, for each ten pages (like 10-19, 20-29, etc.), the digit 4 appears once in the units place. Since there are 9 sets of ten in two-digit numbers (10-99), that's 9 occurrences of 4 in the units place. Similarly, 8 appears 9 times in the units place. \n\nSo, for two-digit numbers, the total number of 4's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. The total number of 8's is 10 (tens) + 9 (units) = 19. So, in two-digit pages, 4 and 8 each appear 19 times. \n\nNow, moving on to three-digit page numbers (100-488). Let's again break this down into hundreds, tens, and units places. \n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The digit 4 appears in the hundreds place only for pages 400-488. That's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89), so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, 0 occurrences of 8 in the hundreds place. \n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, in three-digit numbers, each digit from 0-9 appears in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Let's see:\n\n- 100-199: 140-149, so 10 times.\n- 200-299: 240-249, so 10 times.\n- 300-399: 340-349, so 10 times.\n- 400-488: 440-449, which is 10 pages, but wait, 440-449 is within 400-488, so that's 10 times. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is 89 pages, so from 400-488, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8, but since 488 is the last page, the tens digit goes up to 8. So, in the tens place, 4 appears 10 times in each hundred, except perhaps the last one. Wait, no, because 400-488 includes 400-499, but since the book stops at 488, the tens digit in 400-488 goes up to 8, so 440-449 is still within 488. So, 10 times for each hundred. So, for three-digit numbers, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place for each hundred, and there are 4 hundreds (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), so 4*10=40 times. \n\nWait, but 400-488 is not a full hundred, it's 89 pages. So, does that affect the count? Let me think. The tens digit in 400-488 runs from 0 to 8, so 440-449 is included, which is 10 pages, so yes, 10 times. So, 4 hundreds, each contributing 10 times, so 40 times for 4 in the tens place. \n\nSimilarly, for the digit 8 in the tens place: \n\n- 100-199: 180-189, 10 times.\n- 200-299: 280-289, 10 times.\n- 300-399: 380-389, 10 times.\n- 400-488: 480-489, but since the book ends at 488, 480-488 is 9 pages (480,481,...,488). So, 9 times. \n\nWait, so for 400-488, the tens digit 8 would be in 480-488, which is 9 pages, not 10. So, the count for 8 in the tens place is 3 hundreds with 10 each and the last hundred with 9. So, 3*10 +9=39 times. \n\nWait, but let me confirm: in 400-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times. So, total 8's in tens place: 3*10 +9=39. \n\nNow, moving on to the units place for three-digit numbers. In each hundred, each digit from 0-9 appears once in the units place for each ten. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the units place (e.g., 104,114,...,194 in 100-199). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 10 times in the units place in each hundred (e.g., 108,118,...,198 in 100-199). \n\nBut wait, for 400-488, does the units digit 4 and 8 still appear 10 times? Let's check. \n\nIn 400-488, the units digit cycles from 0-9 for each ten. So, for units digit 4, it would be 404,414,...,484. But 484 is within 488, so that's 9 times (from 404 to 484, stepping by 10). Similarly, for units digit 8, it's 408,418,...,488. But 488 is included, so that's 9 times as well (from 408 to 488, stepping by 10). \n\nWait, but in 400-488, how many times does 4 appear in the units place? Let's see: starting at 404, then 414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. Similarly, 8 in the units place: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. \n\nSo, for the units place in three-digit numbers, each hundred contributes 10 times for digits 4 and 8, except the last hundred (400-488), which contributes 9 times each. \n\nSo, total for units place:\n\n- 4's: 3 hundreds *10 +1*9=39\n- 8's: 3 hundreds *10 +1*9=39\n\nWait, but let me check: 100-199,200-299,300-399 each have 10 occurrences of 4 and 8 in the units place. 400-488 has 9 each. So, total for units place:\n\n4's: 3*10 +9=39\n8's: 3*10 +9=39\n\nSo, in the units place, both 4 and 8 appear 39 times each.\n\nNow, let's sum up all the occurrences for 4 and 8.\n\nFirst, for 4:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place:89, tens place:40, units place:39. So, 89+40+39=168\nTotal 4's:1+19+168=188\n\nWait, let me add that again: 1 (single) +19 (two-digit) +168 (three-digit) =188.\n\nNow for 8:\n\n- Single-digit:1\n- Two-digit:19\n- Three-digit: hundreds place:0, tens place:39, units place:39. So, 0+39+39=78\nTotal 8's:1+19+78=98\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, for 8's:\n\n- Hundreds place:0\n- Tens place:39 (as calculated earlier)\n- Units place:39 (as calculated earlier)\nSo, 39+39=78\n\nThen, adding single-digit and two-digit:\n\nSingle-digit:1, two-digit:19, three-digit:78. So, 1+19=20, 20+78=98.\n\nSo, total 4's:188, total 8's:98.\n\nNow, the problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's. So, 188-98=90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations because 188-98 is 90, but I want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me go through each section again.\n\nSingle-digit:\n\n4:1, 8:1. Correct.\n\nTwo-digit:\n\nTens place:40-49:10 times, 80-89:10 times. Units place: for each ten, 4 appears once, so 9 tens (10-99), so 9 each. So, 10+9=19 for 4, same for 8. So, correct.\n\nThree-digit:\n\nHundreds place:400-488:89 times for 4, 0 for 8.\n\nTens place:4 appears 10 times per hundred, 4 hundreds, so 40. 8 appears 10 times in first three hundreds, and 9 in the last, so 39.\n\nUnits place:4 appears 10 times per hundred for first three, 9 in last: 3*10+9=39. Same for 8:3*10+9=39.\n\nSo, 4's in three-digit:89+40+39=168. 8's:0+39+39=78.\n\nAdding single and two-digit:1+19=20 for both.\n\nSo, total 4's:20+168=188, total 8's:20+78=98.\n\nDifference:188-98=90.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought maybe I missed something in the three-digit units place. Let me think again about the units place in 400-488. For units digit 4, it's 404,414,...,484. That's 9 numbers because 404 +10*8=484. So, 9 times. Similarly, for units digit 8:408,418,...,488. That's 9 numbers as well. So, yes, 9 each.\n\nWait, but in the hundreds place, 400-488 is 89 pages, so 89 occurrences of 4 in the hundreds place. Correct.\n\nSo, I think the calculations are correct. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The difference is 188 - 98 = 90.\n\n$\\boxed{90}$"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every set of ten consecutive numbers, the digit in the units place cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each set of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. For example, in 1-10, it's 4; in 11-20, it's 14; and so on. Now, how many complete sets of ten are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 complete sets and an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, the digit 4 appears 48 times for the complete sets. But wait, I need to check the extra pages as well. From 481 to 488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so the digit 4 appears once more in 484. So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, for the tens digit, each digit from 0 to 9 appears in the tens place for each hundred. So, for each hundred, the digit 4 appears in the tens place for 10 consecutive numbers (e.g., 40-49). How many hundreds are there in 488 pages? There are four hundreds: 1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, and 401-488. Wait, actually, 488 is less than 500, so we have four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 401-488. For each of the first four hundreds, the digit 4 in the tens place appears 10 times (like 40-49 in each hundred). So that's 4 hundreds * 10 = 40 times. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit is 0 for 401-410, 1 for 411-420, and so on up to 8 for 481-490. But since the book ends at 488, the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, does the digit 4 appear in the tens place here? Yes, when the tens digit is 4, which would be 440-449. But wait, 440-449 is within 401-488, so that's another 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4. So, adding that, the total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. From 401-488, the tens digits go from 0 to 8. The digit 4 in the tens place occurs when the tens digit is 4, which is 440-449. That's 10 numbers, so yes, 10 more. So, total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 for all numbers from 400-499. But our book only goes up to 488, so from 400-488. How many numbers is that? 488 - 400 + 1 = 89 numbers. So, the hundreds digit is 4 for 89 numbers, meaning the digit 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nSo, total number of 4's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 50 + 89. Let me add that up: 49 + 50 is 99, plus 89 is 188. So, 188 times the digit 4 appears.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll follow the same approach: units, tens, hundreds.\n\nStarting with the units place: As before, in each set of ten, the digit 8 appears once in the units place. There are 48 complete sets of ten (since 488 / 10 = 48.8) and an extra 8 pages (481-488). So, in the units place, 8 appears 48 times for the complete sets. Now, in the extra pages, 481-488, the units digits go from 1 to 8, so 8 appears once in 488. So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: For the tens digit, each hundred has a set where the tens digit is 8, which is 80-89 in each hundred. So, for each hundred, that's 10 numbers. How many hundreds do we have? Four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and the last partial hundred (401-488). In each full hundred, the tens digit 8 appears 10 times, so 4 * 10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (480-488). So, the tens digit 8 appears in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but 480-488 is 9 numbers, but the tens digit is 8 for all of them. So, that's 9 more times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nWait, but let me check again. From 401-488, the tens digit is 8 only in 480-488, which is 9 numbers because 488 is the last page. So, yes, 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only in numbers from 800-899, but our book only goes up to 488, so the hundreds digit never reaches 8. Therefore, the hundreds place contributes 0 to the count of 8's.\n\nSo, total number of 8's is units + tens + hundreds: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For the tens place in the last partial hundred, 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers, right? So, 9 times. So, yes, 40 + 9 = 49 for tens place. Units place was 49, so total 98. That seems correct.\n\nNow, the number of 4's is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. The problem asks how many more 4's are printed than 8's, so I subtract 98 from 188. 188 - 98 equals 90. So, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 sets of ten, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the extra 8 pages where 484 has a 4, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the last partial hundred where 440-449 is 10, so 50.\n- Hundreds: From 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89.\nTotal: 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. That seems right.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 sets of ten, each contributing 1, so 48. Plus the extra 8 pages where 488 has an 8, so 49.\n- Tens: 4 hundreds, each contributing 10, so 40. Plus the last partial hundred where 480-488 is 9, so 49.\n- Hundreds: 0.\nTotal: 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. That also seems correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning now.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires comparing the frequency of the digit '4' to the digit '8' in all page numbers from 1 to 488.\n\n1. **Counting the digit '4':**\n   - **Units place:** In every 10 numbers, '4' appears once. With 48 complete sets of 10 (480 numbers) and an extra 8 pages (481-488), '4' appears 48 + 1 = 49 times.\n   - **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, '4' appears 10 times in the tens place. For 400-488, it appears another 10 times, totaling 40 + 10 = 50.\n   - **Hundreds place:** From 400-488, '4' appears in the hundreds place 89 times.\n   - **Total '4's:** 49 + 50 + 89 = 188.\n\n2. **Counting the digit '8':**\n   - **Units place:** Similar to '4', '8' appears 48 times in the units place, plus once in 488, totaling 49.\n   - **Tens place:** In every 100 numbers, '8' appears 10 times. For 401-488, it appears 9 times, totaling 40 + 9 = 49.\n   - **Hundreds place:** '8' never appears as the hundreds digit.\n   - **Total '8's:** 49 + 49 = 98.\n\n3. **Difference:** 188 (number of '4's) - 98 (number of '8's) = 90.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with the units place: For every group of ten pages, the units digit cycles from 0 to 9. So, in each group of ten, the digit 4 appears exactly once in the units place. How many such groups are there in 488 pages? Well, 488 divided by 10 is 48.8, which means there are 48 full groups of ten and then 8 extra pages. So, in each of these 48 groups, there's one 4 in the units place, totaling 48 times. Plus, in the last partial group (pages 481-488), the units digit 4 appears once (page 484). So, total units place 4's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nNext, the tens place: Similarly, the tens digit cycles every 100 pages. For each hundred, the tens digit goes through 0-9 ten times each. So, in each hundred, the digit 4 appears 10 times in the tens place. Now, how many full hundreds are there in 488? There are four full hundreds (1-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400) and then 88 pages (401-488). So, in each of the four hundreds, we have 10 occurrences of 4 in the tens place, totaling 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 8. The digit 4 appears in the tens place for pages 440-449, which is 10 times. So, adding that, the total tens place 4's are 40 + 10 = 50.\n\nNow, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit is 4 only in the range 400-488. The hundreds digit is 4 for all these pages, so how many times does 4 appear here? Well, from 400 to 488, that's 89 pages (since 488 - 400 + 1 = 89). So, 4 appears 89 times in the hundreds place.\n\nAdding up all the 4's: Units (49) + Tens (50) + Hundreds (89) = 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. So, there are 188 fours in total.\n\nNow, let's count the number of 8's. I'll do the same approach, checking units, tens, and hundreds places.\n\nUnits place: Similar to 4's, in each group of ten, the digit 8 appears once. So, in 488 pages, how many full groups of ten are there? 48 full groups, each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, in the last partial group (481-488), the units digit 8 appears once (page 488). So, total units place 8's are 48 + 1 = 49.\n\nTens place: For the tens digit, each hundred has the digit 8 appearing 10 times in the tens place (e.g., 80-89 in each hundred). So, for each hundred, that's 10 times. There are four full hundreds in 488 pages, so 4*10 = 40. Now, in the last partial hundred (401-488), the tens digit goes up to 8 (since 488 is the last page). So, in the tens place, 8 appears from 480-488, which is 9 times (pages 480, 481, ..., 488). Wait, but actually, the tens digit is 8 for pages 480-488, which is 9 pages, so 9 times. So, total tens place 8's are 40 + 9 = 49.\n\nHundreds place: The hundreds digit is 8 only if the page number is between 800-899, but since the book only goes up to 488, the hundreds digit never reaches 8. So, 0 occurrences here.\n\nAdding up all the 8's: Units (49) + Tens (49) + Hundreds (0) = 49 + 49 + 0 = 98. So, there are 98 eights in total.\n\nNow, to find how many more 4's than 8's there are: 188 (number of 4's) - 98 (number of 8's) = 90.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my counts to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor 4's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480) each contributing one 4, so 48. Then, from 481-488, page 484 is the only one with a units digit 4. So, 48 + 1 = 49. That seems right.\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so four hundreds give 40. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 pages. So, 40 + 10 = 50. Correct.\n- Hundreds: From 400-488, that's 89 pages, so 89. Total 49 + 50 + 89 = 188. Correct.\n\nFor 8's:\n- Units: 48 full groups (1-480), each contributing one 8, so 48. Then, page 488 adds one more. So, 49. Correct.\n- Tens: Each hundred contributes 10, so four hundreds give 40. Then, in 401-488, the tens digit 8 occurs from 480-488, which is 9 times (pages 480 to 488 inclusive). So, 40 + 9 = 49. Correct.\n- Hundreds: 0, as before. So, total 49 + 49 = 98. Correct.\n\nSo, 188 - 98 = 90. Therefore, there are 90 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe number of 4's printed is 188, and the number of 8's is 98. Subtracting these gives 90 more 4's than 8's.\n\n\\boxed{90}"

    "text": " \n\nStarting with single-digit pages (1-9): The only single-digit number with a 4 is 4 itself. So, that's one 4. There are no 8's in single-digit pages, so the count for 8's here is zero.\n\nNext, two-digit pages (10-99): Here, I can think of each page number as having a tens place and a units place. For the units place: The digit 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so from 10 to 99, that's 9 times (14, 24, 34, ..., 94). Similarly, the digit 8 appears 9 times in the units place (18, 28, ..., 98). For the tens place: The digit 4 appears in the tens place for the entire 40-49 range, which is 10 times (40-49). The digit 8 appears in the tens place for the entire 80-89 range, which is also 10 times. So, total 4's in two-digit pages: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19. Total 8's: 9 (units) + 10 (tens) = 19.\n\nNow, moving on to three-digit pages (100-488): These can be broken down into hundreds, tens, and units places. Let's handle each digit position separately.\n\nFirst, the hundreds place: The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 since the book goes up to 488. For the digit 4 in the hundreds place, it appears from 400 to 488. That's 89 numbers (400-488 inclusive). Wait, 488 - 400 + 1 = 89. So, that's 89 times 4 appears in the hundreds place. The digit 8 never appears in the hundreds place because the hundreds digit only goes up to 4, so no 8's there.\n\nNext, the tens place in three-digit numbers: We need to count how many times 4 and 8 appear in the tens position from 100 to 488. Let's think about this. For each hundred block (100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-488), the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9 every 10 numbers. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the tens place: In each hundred block except the last one (400-488), the tens digit 4 occurs in 10 numbers (e.g., 140-149, 240-249, 340-349). So, that's 3 hundreds blocks, each contributing 10 numbers, so 3*10 = 30. But in the last block, 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so when the tens digit is 4, it's from 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 4's in tens place: 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the tens place: Similarly, in each hundred block except the last, the tens digit 8 occurs in 10 numbers (180-189, 280-289, 380-389). So, 3*10 = 30. In the last block, 400-488, the tens digit can go up to 8, so when the tens digit is 8, it's from 480-488, which is 9 numbers (since 488 is the last page). So, total 8's in tens place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, the units place in three-digit numbers: Similarly, for each hundred block, the units digit cycles through 0-9 every 10 numbers. \n\nFor the digit 4 in the units place: In each hundred block, 4 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. For the first three hundreds (100-399), that's 3*10 = 30. In the last block, 400-488, the units digit 4 appears in 404, 414, ..., 484. Let's see how many that is. From 400-488, the units digit cycles every 10, so 404, 414, 424, 434, 444, 454, 464, 474, 484. That's 9 times because 484 is the last one before 488. So, total 4's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nFor the digit 8 in the units place: Similarly, in each hundred block, 8 appears once every 10 numbers, so 10 times per hundred. For the first three hundreds, that's 3*10 = 30. In the last block, 400-488, the units digit 8 appears in 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 times as well. So, total 8's in units place: 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nWait, but let me check: From 400-488, the units digit 8 occurs at 408, 418, 428, 438, 448, 458, 468, 478, 488. That's 9 numbers, yes. So, 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nNow, let me sum up all the 4's and 8's across all page numbers.\n\nTotal 4's:\n- Single-digit: 1\n- Two-digit: 19\n- Three-digit: 40 (tens) + 39 (units) + 89 (hundreds) = 168\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Wait, in three-digit numbers, I already broke down the hundreds, tens, and units separately. So, let me correct that.\n\nWait, in the hundreds place for three-digit numbers, 4 appears 89 times (from 400-488). In the tens place, 4 appears 40 times, and in the units place, 4 appears 39 times. So total 4's in three-digit pages: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's in three-digit pages: hundreds place: 0, tens place: 39, units place: 39. So, 0 + 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Wait, earlier I thought that in the tens place, 8's in three-digit numbers were 39, and in units place, 39. So, total 78. But let me make sure.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 8's is zero, as the book only goes up to 488, so no hundreds digit is 8.\n\nIn the tens place, 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nIn the units place, 8's: 30 (from 100-399) + 9 (from 400-488) = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit pages: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\nNow, let's add up all the 4's across all page numbers:\n\nSingle-digit: 1\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 168\nTotal 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\nSimilarly, total 8's:\n\nSingle-digit: 0\nTwo-digit: 19\nThree-digit: 78\nTotal 8's: 0 + 19 + 78 = 97.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because earlier in two-digit pages, both 4's and 8's were 19 each. But in three-digit pages, 4's are 168 and 8's are 78. So, total 4's: 1 + 19 + 168 = 188. Total 8's: 0 + 19 + 78 = 97.\n\nSo, the difference would be 188 - 97 = 91.\n\nWait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in counting the three-digit 4's and 8's.\n\nWait, in three-digit numbers, the hundreds place for 4's is from 400-488, which is 89 numbers, so 89 4's in the hundreds place.\n\nIn the tens place for 4's: From 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the tens digit is 4 (e.g., 140-149), so 3 hundreds * 10 = 30. Then, in 400-488, the tens digit 4 occurs in 440-449, which is 10 numbers. So, total 30 + 10 = 40.\n\nIn the units place for 4's: From 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where the units digit is 4, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, the units digit 4 occurs in 404,414,...,484. Let's count: 404,414,424,434,444,454,464,474,484. That's 9 numbers. So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 4's in three-digit: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168. That seems correct.\n\nFor 8's in three-digit:\n\nHundreds place: 0.\n\nTens place: From 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where tens digit is 8, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, tens digit 8 occurs in 480-488, which is 9 numbers (480,481,...,488). So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nUnits place: From 100-399, each hundred has 10 numbers where units digit is 8, so 3*10=30. In 400-488, units digit 8 occurs in 408,418,...,488. Let's count: 408,418,428,438,448,458,468,478,488. That's 9 numbers. So, total 30 + 9 = 39.\n\nSo, total 8's in three-digit: 39 (tens) + 39 (units) = 78.\n\nNow, adding up all 4's:\n\nSingle-digit:1\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:168\n\nTotal 4's:1+19=20; 20+168=188.\n\nTotal 8's:\n\nSingle-digit:0\n\nTwo-digit:19\n\nThree-digit:78\n\nTotal 8's:0+19=19; 19+78=97.\n\nSo, difference:188-97=91.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, there are 91 more 4's than 8's.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires counting the occurrences of the digits 4 and 8 in the page numbers of a 488-page book. \n\n**Counting 4's:**\n- **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 1 occurrence (page 4).\n- **Two-digit pages (10-99):** 19 occurrences (9 in units, 10 in tens).\n- **Three-digit pages (100-488):** \n  - Hundreds place: 89 occurrences (400-488).\n  - Tens place: 40 occurrences (30 from 100-399, 10 from 400-488).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n  - Total: 89 + 40 + 39 = 168.\n\n**Total 4's:** 1 + 19 + 168 = 188.\n\n**Counting 8's:**\n- **Single-digit pages (1-9):** 0 occurrences.\n- **Two-digit pages (10-99):** 19 occurrences (9 in units, 10 in tens).\n- **Three-digit pages (100-488):**\n  - Tens place: 39 occurrences (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n  - Units place: 39 occurrences (30 from 100-399, 9 from 400-488).\n  - Total: 39 + 39 = 78.\n\n**Total 8's:** 0 + 19 + 78 = 97.\n\n**Difference:** 188 (4's) - 97 (8's) = 91.\n\n**Answer:** The number of 4's printed exceeds the number of 8's by 91.\n\n\\boxed{91}"
